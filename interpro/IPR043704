Tail assembly protein GT shares it's N-terminal residues with tail assembly protein G, followed by residues of unique sequence [[cite:PUB00012906]]. An analogous frameshift is widely conserved among other dsDNA tailed phages in their corresponding 'G' and 'GT' tail genes even in the absence of detectable sequence homology [[cite:PUB00094497]]. The lambda tail assembly protein G and frameshift product GT are produced in a molar ratio of approximately 30:1[[cite:PUB00094496]]. The correct molar ratio of these two related proteins, normally determined by the efficiency of the frameshift, is crucial for efficient assembly of functional tails [[cite:PUB00094497]]. Although tail assembly proteins G and GT are both required for assembly of functional tails, neither is present in mature tails [[cite:PUB00094496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04134" "Tail assembly protein GT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tail assembly protein GT", "short" "Tail_assembly_GT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 50, "taxa" 391, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 924, "sets" 0, "proteins" 920, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 523}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043704", :literature {"PUB00012906" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Levin ME" "Hendrix RW" "Casjens SR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
