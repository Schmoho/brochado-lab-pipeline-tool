{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this PqqD-related family so far occur only in the genus Geobacter, always together with a PqqE-like radical SAM domain/SPASM domain protein and a second SPASM domain protein with traces of a degenerate radical SAM domain. The extended gene region includes a high-molecular-weight cytochrome c family protein. Besides authentic PqqD ([ncbifam:TIGR03859]), another example of a PqqD family protein occurs in the SynChlorMet cassette, again with two PqqE-like proteins. The system is named GeoRSP for its prevalence in Geobacter, its Radical SAM protein, is SPASM domain protein, and its PqqD family protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR041881", "name" "Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein D superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04302" "GeoRSP system PqqD family peptide chaperone"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GeoRSP system PqqD family protein", "short" "Geo_PqqD_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 62, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1057", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1057"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027569", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008792", "name" "Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein D", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR022479", "name" "Coenzyme PQQ synthesis D, bacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026342", "name" "SynChlorMet cassette protein ScmD", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027569", "name" "GeoRSP system PqqD family protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
