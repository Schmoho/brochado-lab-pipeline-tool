{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacteria dimerize pairs of 70S ribosomes into inactive 100S ribosomes during the stationary phase and when exposed to certain stresses, a process that is called ribosome hibernation. Hibernating ribosomes are formed by the activity of one or more highly conserved proteins. In Gammaproteobacteria two proteins are involved in this process, ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and hibernation promoting factor (HPF), while most Gram-positive bacteria produce a single, longer HPF protein [[cite:PUB00080269], [cite:PUB00084195]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family includes the long form of the HPF proteins and the functional homologue PSRP1, a ribosome-binding factor from chloroplasts [[cite:PUB00084201]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036567", "name" "Ribosome hibernation promotion factor-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038416", "name" "Sigma 54 modulation/S30EA ribosomal protein, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00839" "Ribosome hibernation promoting factor [hpf]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome hibernation promoting factor, long/plastid", "short" "HPF_long/plastid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5673, "taxa" 19698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18448, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18448, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14169}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034694", :literature {"PUB00084201" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sharma MR" "Donhofer A" "Barat C" "Marquez V" "Datta PP" "Fucini P" "Wilson DN" "Agrawal RK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
