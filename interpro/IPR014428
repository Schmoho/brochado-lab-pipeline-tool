{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group contains Holliday junction resolvases (HJRs) of the archaeal type, Hjc and Hje proteins [[cite:PUB00007198]]. The Holliday junction is an essential intermediate of homologous recombination. Holliday junctions are four-stranded DNA complexes that are formed during recombination and related DNA repair events. In the presence of divalent cations, these junctions exist predominantly as the stacked-X form, in which the double-helical segments are coaxially stacked and twisted by 60 degrees in a right-handed direction across the junction crossover. In this structure, the stacked arms resemble two adjacent double helices, but are linked at the junction by two common strands that cross over between the duplexes [[cite:PUB00007199], [cite:PUB00025665], [cite:PUB00027724]]. During homologous recombination, genetic information is physically exchanged between parental DNAs via crossing single strands of the same polarity within the four-way Holliday structure. This process is terminated by the endonucleolytic activity of resolvases, which convert the four-way DNA back to two double strands. There is some structural similarity between the archeal HJRs and type II restriction endonucleases. This similarity includes their active site configurations [[cite:PUB00080498]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ob8", "name" "Holliday Junction Resolving Enzyme"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011335", "name" "Restriction endonuclease type II-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011856", "name" "tRNA endonuclease-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040854" "Holliday junction resolvase Hjc"}, "cdd" {"cd00523" "Holliday junction resolvase"}, "panther" {"PTHR39651" "HOLLIDAY JUNCTION RESOLVASE HJC"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004985" "Holliday junction resolvase, archaeal type"}, "hamap" {"MF_01490" "Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease Hjc [hjc]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease Hjc, archaeal", "short" "Hjc_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 1544, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1422}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
