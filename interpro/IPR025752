{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of closely related high pH (HPH) proteins that are integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins required for yeast survival under environmental stress conditions [[cite:PUB00057945]]. They interact with several subunits of the Sec63/Sec62 complex that mediates post-translational translocation of proteins into the ER  [[cite:PUB00057944]]. Cells with mutant Hph1 and Hph2 proteins reveal phenotypes resembling those of mutants defective for vacuolar proton ATPase (V-ATPase) activity. The yeast V-ATPase is a multisubunit complex whose function, structure, and assembly have been well characterised. Cells with impaired V-ATPase activity fail to acidify the vacuole, cannot grow at alkaline pH, and are sensitive to high concentrations of extracellular calcium.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13694" "Sec63/Sec62 complex-interacting family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "High pH protein family", "short" "HPH_family"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 129, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 72, "sets" 0, "proteins" 71, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 57}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025752", :literature {"PUB00057944" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pina FJ" "O'Donnell AF" "Pagant S" "Piao HL" "Miller JP" "Fields S" "Miller EA" "Cyert MS."], "ISO_journal" "Eukaryotic Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.00241-10", "medline_journal" "Eukaryot Cell", "title" "Hph1 and Hph2 are novel components of the Sec63/Sec62 posttranslational translocation complex that aid in vacuolar proton ATPase biogenesis.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "63-71", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21097665}, "PUB00057945" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Heath VL" "Shaw SL" "Roy S" "Cyert MS."], "ISO_journal" "Eukaryotic Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.3.3.695-704.2004", "medline_journal" "Eukaryot Cell", "title" "Hph1p and Hph2p, novel components of calcineurin-mediated stress responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "695-704", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15189990}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005783", "name" "endoplasmic reticulum", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025752", "name" "High pH protein family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 22}}}
