In the Nudaurelia capensis omega virus capsid protein the residues that form the catalytic dyad in the active site are Glu103 and Asn570. The cleavage mediated by the enzyme is an autolytic one, and the catalytic Asn is also the P1 residue in the cleavage site, Asn570-|-Phe571 releasing a 74-residue fragment from the C terminus of the coat protein. This cleavage occurs during the late stages of virion assembly. Heterologous expression of the coat protein gene of tetravirus in a baculovirus system results in the spontaneous assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) that remain uncleaved when purified at neutral pH [[cite:PUB00054233]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF007212" "Predicted capsid protein, P70 type"}, "pfam" {"PF03566" "Peptidase family A21"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase N2", "short" "Peptidase_N2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 111, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 96, "sets" 0, "proteins" 91, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005313", :literature {"PUB00054233" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Taylor DJ" "Johnson JE."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1110/ps.041054605", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Folding and particle assembly are disrupted by single-point mutations near the autocatalytic cleavage site of Nudaurelia capensis omega virus capsid protein.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "401-8", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15659373}, "PUB00054229" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["Ferris HU" "Furukawa Y" "Minamino T" "Kroetz MB" "Kihara M" "Namba K" "Macnab RM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
