{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Uridine 5'-triphosphate:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase, [ec:2.7.7.9]) is responsible for the synthesis of UDP-glucose, a key compound in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides. Glucose is fermented through the glycolysis step to pyruvate, which in turn is converted to lactate. The glycolytic intermediate glucose 6-phosphate is converted to glucose 1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase activity, and this metabolite is subsequently converted to UDP-glucose by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (GalU) activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2e3d", "name" "Crystal structure of E. coli glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02541" "Prokaryotic UGPase catalyses the synthesis of UDP-glucose"}, "panther" {"PTHR43197" "UTP--GLUCOSE-1-PHOSPHATE URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01099" "UTP--glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase GalU"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UTP--glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, bacterial/archaeal-type", "short" "GalU_uridylyltTrfase_bac/arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6802, "taxa" 27719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38610, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38610, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29908}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1648", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1648"} {"accession" "GenProp1743", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1743"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
