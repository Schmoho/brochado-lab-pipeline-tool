{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from tailed bacteriophages and proteobacterial prophages, including Gp28 from E217, a Pseudomonas phage used in an experimental cocktail to eradicate cystic fibrosis-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The collar protein gp28 is located at the neck of the E217 virion. Gp28 consists of a small β-barrel decorated by an α-helix and two wing-like lateral extensions. Six collar proteins pack under the head-to-tail dodecamer with Gp28 N-helix positioned orthogonal to two Gp27 subunits. On the opposite side of the Gp28 barrel, the wing-like extensions contact two gateway subunits [[cite:PUB00153918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22755" "E217 collar protein gp28"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Collar protein gp28-like", "short" "Gp28-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 35, "taxa" 533, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 374, "sets" 0, "proteins" 374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 114}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054441", :literature {"PUB00153918" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Li F" "Hou CD" "Lokareddy RK" "Yang R" "Forti F" "Briani F" "Cingolani G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39756-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "High-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Pseudomonas bacteriophage E217.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "4052", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37422479}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054441", "name" "Collar protein gp28-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 18, "alignment:full" 39}}}
