{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell exterior. There have been four secretion systems described in animal enteropathogens such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia.<p>The type III secretion system is of great interest as it is used to transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell [[cite:PUB00007898]] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00007583]]. However, while the latter forms a ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of the flagellum itself, type III subunits in the outer membrane translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.</p>\n\n<p>One of the outer membrane protein subunit families, termed \"O\" here for nomenclature purposes, aids in the structural assembly of the invasion complex [[cite:PUB00007701]]. It is essential for the secretion of the Sip toxins in Salmonella and Shigella (SspaO gene). Members of this family also include YscQ protein (Yersinia), and the plant enteropathogen gene Y4YK (Rhizobium). The flagellar protein FliN also shares partial similarity, probably due to evolution of the type III secretion system from the flagellar biosynthetic pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036429", "name" "SpoA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01339" "TYPE3OMOPROT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system outer membrane, SpaO", "short" "T3SS_OMP_SpaO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 72, "taxa" 808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3533, "sets" 0, "proteins" 994, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 829}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003283", :literature {"PUB00007898" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5418", "authors" ["Galan JE" "Collmer A."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.284.5418.1322", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Type III secretion machines: bacterial devices for protein delivery into host cells.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1322-8", "volume" "284", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10334981}, "PUB00007583" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Komoriya K" "Shibano N" "Higano T" "Azuma N" "Yamaguchi S" "Aizawa SI."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
