{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of beta-D-xylosidases mainly from bacteria, fungi, animals and plants. They belong to a subgroup of the glycoside hydrolase family 3.</p>\n\n<p>Xylan, a prominent component of cellulosic biomass, has a high potential for degradation into reducing sugars, and subsequent conversion into bioethanol. This process requires a range of xylanolytic enzymes, including beta-xylosidases. This entry includes fungal exo-1,4-beta-xylosidase xlnD [[cite:PUB00097677], [cite:PUB00097678]] and bxlB [[cite:PUB00079200]].</p>\n\n<p>In bacteria, Prevotella ruminicola Xyl3A has been shown to have beta-xylosidase activity via its capacity to hydrolyze glycosidic linkages of beta-1,4-xylo-oligosaccharides of various lengths (X2 to X6), releasing xylose monomers [[cite:PUB00097679]].</p>\n\n<p>In Arabidopsis, there are seven members AtBXL1-7 in this entry.  AtBXL1 is a bifunctional beta-d-xylosidase/alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase required for pectic arabinan modification and is involved in secondary cell wall metabolism and plant development [[cite:PUB00097680], [cite:PUB00097681], [cite:PUB00097682]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5a7m", "name" "The structure of Hypocrea jecorina beta-xylosidase Xyl3A (Bxl1)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42721" "SUGAR HYDROLASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-D-xylosidase", "short" "BXL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2932, "taxa" 10168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12197}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
