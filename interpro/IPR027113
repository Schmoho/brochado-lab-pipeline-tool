{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The eukaryotic transcription factors NF-Y, also known as CCAAT-binding factors (CBF) or heme activator protein (HAP), bind to a CCAAT element in the promoters of a wide variety of genes, to regulate its expression. They consists of three distinct subunits: NF-YA (also known as CBF-B or HAP2), NF-YB (CBF-A or HAP3) and NF-YC (CBF-C or HAP5). The NF-YB subunit consists of three regions, an N-terminal A domain, a central conserved B domain, and a C-terminal C domain. The B domain is highly conserved and the most important part of the NF-YB subunit, as it is required for the interaction with NF-YA and NF-YC to form the heterotrimeric complex and contain the evolutionarily-conserved DNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00002598], [cite:PUB00004401], [cite:PUB00095389]]. There is only a gene encoding NF-YB in yeast and animals, but in plants there are gene families encoding this subunit, for example in Arabidopsis there are at least 10 NF-YB genes [[cite:PUB00095390]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents CBF-A or NF-YB from vertebrates and HAP3 from yeast. The Kluyveromyces lactis HAP3 protein has been predicted to contain a 4-cysteine zinc finger, which is thought to be present in similar HAP3 and CBF subunit A proteins, in which the third cysteine is replaced by a serine [[cite:PUB00003767]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4csr", "name" "High resolution crystal structure of the histone fold dimer (NF-YB)-(NF-YC)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009072", "name" "Histone-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11064" "CCAAT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor NFYB/HAP3", "short" "Transc_fact_NFYB/HAP3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2583, "taxa" 8853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10289, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10289, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6545}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027113", :literature {"PUB00095390" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Yang S" "Wang Y" "Yin H" "Guo H" "Gao M" "Zhu H" "Chen Y."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
