{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme resembles some other chorismate-binding enzymes, including para-aminobenzoate synthase (pabB) and isochorismate synthase. There is a fairly deep split between two sets, seen in the pattern of gaps as well as in amino acid sequence differences. This group includes eukaryotes, archaea, and many bacterial lineages; sequences from the second group may resemble pabB more closely than other trpE from the other group. The other group includes Gram-negative proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori but also the Gram-positive organism Corynebacterium glutamicum, and is described by [interpro:IPR005257].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7bvd", "name" "Anthranilate synthase component I (TrpE)[Mycolicibacterium smegmatis]"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR005801", "name" "ADC synthase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00564" "anthranilate synthase component I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anthranilate synthase component I, PabB-like", "short" "Anth_synth_I_PabB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6228, "taxa" 21953, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22621, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22621, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17002}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0037"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
