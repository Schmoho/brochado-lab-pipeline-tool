{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme TTHA1902 ([swissprot:Q5SH28]) and related proteins found in Thermales. This enzyme belongs to GH family 57 and contains the five conserved family GH57 sequence motifs including the catalytic nucleophile glutamate and acid/base aspartate. It also possesses the D region thought to be typical for the GH57 glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) subfamily. TTHA1902 is involved in glycogen biosynthesis and catalyses the formation of branch points in alpha-glucans by cleavage of an alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond and subsequent transfer of the cleaved-off oligosaccharide to a new alpha-1,6 position.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of TTHA1902 is determined ([pdbe:3P0B]) and consists of two domains: a seven-stranded β/α-barrel and an α-helical C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00090452]]. Both N- and C-terminal domains are essential for catalysis and substrate binding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3p0b", "name" "Thermus thermophilus family GH57 branching enzyme: crystal structure, mechanism of action and products formed"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027291", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase 38, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041566" "1,4-alpha-glucan branching protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme TTHA1902", "short" "TTHA1902"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 43, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
