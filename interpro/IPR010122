{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase ([ec:2.3.3.10]) catalyses the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to produce HMG-CoA and CoA, the second reaction in the mevalonate-dependent isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. HMG-CoA synthase contains an important catalytic cysteine residue that acts as a nucleophile in the first step of the reaction: the acetylation of the enzyme by acetyl-CoA (its first substrate) to produce an acetyl-enzyme thioester, releasing the reduced coenzyme A. The subsequent nucleophilic attack on acetoacetyl-CoA (its second substrate) leads to the formation of HMG-CoA [[cite:PUB00036056]].</p>\r\n<p>HMG-CoA synthase occurs in eukaryotes, archaea and certain bacteria [[cite:PUB00036057]]. In vertebrates, there are two isozymes located in different subcellular compartments: a cytosolic form that is the starting point of the mevalonate pathway (leads to cholesterol and other sterolic and isoprenoid compounds), and a mitochondrial form responsible for ketone body biosynthesis. HMG-CoA is also found in other eukaryotes such as insects, plants and fungi [[cite:PUB00036058]]. In bacteria, isoprenoid precursors are generally synthesised via an alternative, non-mevalonate pathway, however a number of Gram-positive pathogens utilise a mevalonate pathway involving HMG-CoA synthase that is parallel to that found in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00036059], [cite:PUB00036060]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry is specific for eukaryotic HMG-CoA synthase enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wya", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL 3-HYDROXY-3-METHYLGLUTARYL- COENZYME A SYNTHASE 2 (HMGCS2)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016039", "name" "Thiolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01833" "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, eukaryotic", "short" "HMG_CoA_synthase_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2490, "taxa" 8562, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5784, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3743}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1432", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1432"} {"accession" "GenProp0047", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0047"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
