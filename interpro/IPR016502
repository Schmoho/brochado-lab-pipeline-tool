It delivers toxins and a range of hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-active enzymes to the cell surface or extracellular space [[cite:PUB00093998]]. T2SS systems are composed of 11 to 15 different proteins, which are generally called GspA to GspO and GspS. The T2SS spans the two bacterial membranes and ensures secretion of folded proteins across the outer membrane pore formed by GspD. The inner membrane complex contains GspC, GspL, GspM, and GspF. The cytoplasmic domains of GspL and GspF interact with an ATPase, GspE. GspE is thought to energize the formation of a short pseudopilus by several pilin-like proteins, GspG to GspK [[cite:PUB00094004]]. GspD has been shown to interact with the inner membrane component GspC [[cite:PUB00051842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ftf", "name" "Structure of the Type II secretion system pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16549" "Type II secretion system (T2SS) pilotin, S protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF007010" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP007010 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II secretion system (T2SS) pilotin, S protein", "short" "T2SSS_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 431, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 491, "sets" 0, "proteins" 491, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 382}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016502", :literature {"PUB00076276" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Dunstan RA" "Heinz E" "Wijeyewickrema LC" "Pike RN" "Purcell AW" "Evans TJ" "Praszkier J" "Robins-Browne RM" "Strugnell RA" "Korotkov KV" "Lithgow T."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003117", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Assembly of the type II secretion system such as found in Vibrio cholerae depends on the novel Pilotin AspS.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e1003117", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23326233}, "PUB00094002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lopez-Castilla A" "Vitorge B" "Khoury L" "Morellet N" "Francetic O" "Izadi-Pruneyre N."], "ISO_journal" "Biomol NMR Assign", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biomol NMR Assign", "title" "1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments and secondary structure of PulG, the major pseudopilin from Klebsiella oxytoca type 2 secretion system.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "155-158", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28258547}, "PUB00051842" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Korotkov KV" "Pardon E" "Steyaert J" "Hol WG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2008.11.011", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the secretin GspD from ETEC determined with the assistance of a nanobody.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "255-65", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19217396}, "PUB00094004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Wang X" "Pineau C" "Gu S" "Guschinskaya N" "Pickersgill RW" "Shevchik VE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
