{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant PX domain-containing proteins, including EREX and EREL1/2 from Arabidopsis. EREX interacts with ARA7 and RHA1 (RAB5 members), whereas EREL1/2 was not shown to interact with these RAB5 members. EREX serves as an effector of canonical RAB5 GTPases and regulates membrane trafficking to protein storage vacuole. EREX and EREL1 act in the same trafficking and developmental events, while EREL2 has a partially redundant function with EREX and EREL1 [[cite:PUB00096503]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46856" "PX DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN EREL1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PX domain-containing protein EREX-like", "short" "EREX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 263, "taxa" 1035, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1315, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1315, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 776}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044588", :literature {"PUB00096503" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sakurai HT" "Inoue T" "Nakano A" "Ueda T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "ENDOSOMAL RAB EFFECTOR WITH PX-DOMAIN, an Interacting Partner of RAB5 GTPases, Regulates Membrane Trafficking to Protein Storage Vacuoles in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1490-503", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27288222}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015031", "name" "protein transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044588", "name" "PX domain-containing protein EREX-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
