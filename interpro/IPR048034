{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes CopL and its homologues, a protein that is required for copper-inducible expression of multicopper oxidase CopA in X. axonopodis [[cite:PUB00105345]]. The regulatory function of this protein is likely to involve a copper binding, whereas a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator activity was not demonstrated. Members of this family contain a number of conserved cysteine and histidine residues, that may be part of potential metal-binding sites.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033807" "CopL family metal-binding regulatory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CopL-like", "short" "CopL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 469, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 499, "sets" 0, "proteins" 499, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 342}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048034", :literature {"PUB00105345" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Voloudakis AE" "Reignier TM" "Cooksey DA."], "ISO_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "title" "Regulation of resistance to copper in Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "782-9", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15691931}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048034", "name" "CopL-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
