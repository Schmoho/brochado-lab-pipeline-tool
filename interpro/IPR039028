{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes [3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase [lipoamide]] kinase (BCKDK) and [Pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] kinase (PDK). BCKDK is a serine/threonine-protein kinase component of macronutrients metabolism. It forms a functional kinase and phosphatase pair with PPM1K, serving as a metabolic regulatory node that coordinates branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) with glucose and lipid metabolism via two distinct phosphoprotein targets: mitochondrial BCKDHA subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex and cytosolic ACLY, a lipogenic enzyme of Krebs cycle [[cite:PUB00088772], [cite:PUB00153164], [cite:PUB00153165]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8egf", "name" "Branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase in complex with inhibitor"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036784", "name" "Alpha-ketoacid/pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11947" "PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE KINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PDK/BCKDK protein kinase", "short" "BCKD/PDK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 78, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2619, "taxa" 8948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14982, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14982, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9467}, "pathways" 24}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
