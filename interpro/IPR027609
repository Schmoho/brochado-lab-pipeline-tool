QueE is involved in making preQ0 (7-cyano-7-deazaquanine), a precursor of both the bacterial/eukaryotic modified tRNA base queuosine and the archaeal modified base archaeosine. Members of this family occur in species that lack known forms of QueE, but usually are not found in queuosine biosynthesis operons.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04322" "7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase QueE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase, proteobacteria", "short" "rSAM_QueE_proteobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 353, "taxa" 2290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2236, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2236, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1698}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
