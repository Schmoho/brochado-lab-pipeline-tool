{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell cycle control and in RNA polymerase II-mediated RNA transcription. It is activated by binding to a cyclin; binding to a different cyclin and phosphorylation of another kinase progresses the cell cycle.  CDK7 binds cyclin-B and phosphorylates CDK1 during G2-M transition, and phosphorylates CDK2 and binds to cyclins during G1-S transition [[cite:PUB00087591], [cite:PUB00055076]].  CDK7 phosphorylates and activates p53 following DNA damage [[cite:PUB00087592]], but CDK7 is then inactivated by p53, which arrests the cell cycle, allowing the cell to recover or undergo apoptosis [[cite:PUB00087593]]. CDK7 is also the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex, which also contains cyclin-H (CCNH) and MAT1 [[cite:PUB00087594], [cite:PUB00062805]]. In turn, the CAK associates with the core-TFIIH to form the TFIIH basal transcription factor [[cite:PUB00068177]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes CDK7 from animals, Kin28 from budding yeasts and Crk1 (also known as Mcs6) from fission yeasts.

Mcs6 modulates gene expression through both its CAK and CTD kinase activities [[cite:PUB00088096]].  Kin28 is the closest homologue of CDK7 from budding yeasts. It forms a complex with Ccl1 and Tfb3. This complex associate with TFIIH for transcription regulating activity, but does not display CAK activity [[cite:PUB00088095]].
