{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the tRNA (cytidine(32)/guanosine(34)-2'-O)-methyltransferases, including Trm7 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Trm7 methylates the 2'-O-ribose of nucleotides at positions 32 and 34 of the tRNA anticodon loop of tRNA(Phe), tRNA(Trp) and tRNA(Leu(UAA)) [[cite:PUB00054996]]. It requires Trm732 for methylation of the cytidine at position 32 and Rtt10/Trm734 for methylation of the nucleotides at position 34 in substrate tRNAs [[cite:PUB00068806]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes FTSJ1 from human. FTSJ1 is a homologue of yeast Trm7 and may play a role in the regulation of translation. Mutations in FTSJ1 cause the mental retardation, X-linked 44 (MRX44), which is a disorder characterised by significantly below average general intellectual functioning associated with impairments in adaptive behaviour and manifested during the developmental period [[cite:PUB00068807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03162" "Putative tRNA (cytidine(32)/guanosine(34)-2'-O)-methyltransferase [TRM7]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA (cytidine(32)/guanosine(34)-2-O)-methyltransferase TRM7", "short" "RNA_methyltr_E_TRM7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1854, "taxa" 6656, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3288, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3288, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2113}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
