{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sorbitol dehydrogenase is an NAD(+) binding protein of the polyol pathway, which interconverts glucose and fructose. Sorbitol dehydrogenase is tetrameric and has a single catalytic zinc per subunit [[cite:PUB00098511]]. Proteins in this entry also includes D-xylulose reductases and L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenases from fungi, such as XdhA from Aspergillus oryzae and Lad1 from Hypocrea jecorina. XdhA catalyses the conversion of xylitol to D-xylulose. Xylose is a major component of hemicelluloses such as xylan [[cite:PUB00098512]]. Lad1 catalyses the NAD-dependent oxidation of L-arabinitol to L-xylulose in the fungal L-arabinose catabolic pathway [[cite:PUB00098513]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vm2", "name" "Crystal structure of ECK1772, an oxidoreductase/dehydrogenase of unknown specificity involved in membrane biogenesis from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05285" "Sorbitol dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sorbitol dehydrogenase-like", "short" "SDH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3196, "taxa" 12023, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14015, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13970, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9543}, "pathways" 164}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
