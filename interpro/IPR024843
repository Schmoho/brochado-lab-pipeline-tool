{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dact (dapper) proteins were identified through binding to dishevelled, a cytoplasmic protein central to Wnt signaling. The different dact proteins seem to have distinct signaling and developmental roles.  In Zebrafish, dact1 but not dact2 is required to enhance Wnt/beta-catenin activity, while functional interaction with Wnt/Ca2+-PCP signaling has been described for dact2, but not dact1 [[cite:PUB00056669]]. Data from other vertebrates seems to be consistent with a distinct signaling and developmental role for dact1, dact2 and dact3 [[cite:PUB00056662]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15919" "DAPPER-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF15268" "Dapper"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dapper", "short" "Dapper"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 643, "taxa" 2191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3326, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2592, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1644}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024843", :literature {"PUB00056669" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Waxman JS" "Hocking AM" "Stoick CL" "Moon RT."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.01520", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Zebrafish Dapper1 and Dapper2 play distinct roles in Wnt-mediated developmental processes.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "5909-21", "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15539487}, "PUB00056662" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Fisher DA" "Kivimae S" "Hoshino J" "Suriben R" "Martin PM" "Baxter N" "Cheyette BN."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
