{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of chloroplast encoded Ycf2, which is around 2000  residues in length. Ycf2 is a component of the Ycf2-FtsHi complex which has been identified as chloroplast import motor. The Ycf2-FtsHi complex is composed of six distinct components. This heterohexameric assembly is organized in a counterclockwise order with components arranged as Ycf2, FtsHi5, FtsHi1, FtsHi2, FtsHi4, and FtsH12 [[cite:PUB00159880]]. A collaborative interplay between the Ycf2-FtsHi complex and the TIC (translocon at the inner chloroplast membrane) complex, contributes to the efficient translocation of preproteins into the chloroplasts [[cite:PUB00159880], [cite:PUB00011516]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01330" "Protein Ycf2 [ycf2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ycf2", "short" "Uncharacterised_Ycf2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 15084, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 82}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008543", :literature {"PUB00011516" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Drescher A" "Ruf S" "Calsa T Jr" "Carrer H" "Bock R."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00722.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The two largest chloroplast genome-encoded open reading frames of higher plants are essential genes.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "97-104", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10792825}, "PUB00159880" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Liang K" "Jin Z" "Zhan X" "Li Y" "Xu Q" "Xie Y" "Yang Y" "Wang S" "Wu J" "Yan Z."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.08.003", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural insights into the chloroplast protein import in land plants.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "5651-5664.e18", "volume" "187", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 39197452}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008543", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ycf2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
