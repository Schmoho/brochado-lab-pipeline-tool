{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group contains response regulators involved in the control of heterocyst pattern formation. Heterocysts are microaerobic, N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cells that form in a patterned array within O<sub>2</sub>-producing filamentous cyanobacteria [[cite:PUB00014606]]. PatA plays a role in controlling the differentiation process that produces heterocysts [[cite:PUB00014607], [cite:PUB00014606], [cite:PUB00014608]]. PatA and HetR are believed to be components of the same environment-sensing regulatory circuit in species of<i>Anabaena</i> [[cite:PUB00014607], [cite:PUB00014606], [cite:PUB00014608]].</p>\n\n<p>Response regulators of the microbial two-component signal transduction systems typically consist of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver (phosphoacceptor) domain and a C-terminal output (usually DNA-binding) domain. Members of this group, however, have the receiver domain in the C-terminal region, and the exact function of the N-terminal domain is not clear yet. In two-component signal transduction systems, in response to an environmental stimulus, a phosphoryl group is transferred from the His residue of sensor histidine kinase to an Asp residue in the CheY-like receiver domain of the cognate response regulator [[cite:PUB00011096], [cite:PUB00011190], [cite:PUB00007866]]. Phosphorylation of the receiver domain induces conformational changes that activate an associated output domain, which in turn triggers the response. Phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in response regulator molecules have been demonstrated in direct structural studies [[cite:PUB00011157]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005897" "Response regulator of heterocyst pattern formation PatA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Signal transduction response regulator, heterocyst pattern formation, PatA", "short" "Sig_transdc_resp-reg_PatA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 170, "taxa" 998, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2329, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2141, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1427}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024186", :literature {"PUB00007866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["West AH" "Stock AM."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
