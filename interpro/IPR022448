{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are found in known methanotrophs and a range of PQQ-biosynthesising species. Interpretation of evidence by homology and by direct experimental work suggest two different roles. By homology, these proteins appear to be the periplasmic substrate-binding protein of an ABC transport family. However, mutational studies and direct characterisation for some sequences related to these proteins suggests they may act as a maturation chaperone or additional subunit of a methanol dehydrogenase-like enzyme [[cite:PUB00085835]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03871" "quinoprotein dehydrogenase-associated putative ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Quinoprotein dehydrogenase-associated", "short" "Quinoprotein_dehydrogenase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 485, "taxa" 2088, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2148, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2148, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1755}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1101", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1101"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022448", :literature {"PUB00085835" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Harms N" "de Vries GE" "Maurer K" "Hoogendijk J" "Stouthamer AH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
