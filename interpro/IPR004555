{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>OpcA protein may play a role in the functional assembly of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00017447]]. The opcA gene is found immediately downstream of zwf, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) gene, in a number of species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Nostoc punctiforme (strain ATCC 29133/PCC 73102), and Synechococcus sp. (strain PCC 7942). In the latter, disruption of opcA was shown to block assembly of G6PDH into active oligomeric forms.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38658" "OXPP CYCLE PROTEIN OPCA-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00534" "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assembly protein OpcA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assembly protein OpcA", "short" "G6PDH_assembly_OpcA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2118, "taxa" 7048, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5601}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004555", :literature {"PUB00017447" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sundaram S" "Karakaya H" "Scanlan DJ" "Mann NH."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Multiple oligomeric forms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in cyanobacteria and the role of OpcA in the assembly process.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "1549-56", "volume" "144 ( Pt 6)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9639925}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004555", "name" "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assembly protein OpcA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
