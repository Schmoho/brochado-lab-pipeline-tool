{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sequence analysis of the products of the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR) gene family indicates that they share a variable N terminus and a highly conserved C terminus that contains five recognizable motifs [[cite:PUB00008372]]. Proteins in the GRAS family are major players in gibberellin (GA) signaling, which regulates various aspects of plant growth and development [[cite:PUB00008372]]. Mutation of the SCARECROW (SCR) gene results in a radial pattern defect, loss of a ground tissue layer, in the root. The PAT1 protein is involved in phytochrome A signal transduction [[cite:PUB00008373]].</p>\n\n<p>A sequence, structure and evolutionary analysis showed that the GRAS family emerged in bacteria and belongs to the Rossmann-fold, AdoMET (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase superfamily [[cite:PUB00066769]]. All bacterial, and a subset of plant GRAS proteins, are predicted to be active and function as small-molecule methylases. Several plant GRAS proteins lack one or more AdoMet (SAM)-binding residues while preserving their substrate-binding residues. Although GRAS proteins are implicated to function as transcriptional factors, the above analysis suggests that they instead might either modify or bind small molecules [[cite:PUB00066769]].</p>\n\n<ul>Some proteins known to belong to the GRAS family are listed below:<li>Arabidopsis thaliana SCARECROW (SCR) protein. It regulates asymetric cell divisions of cortex/endodermal initial cells during root development.</li>\n<li>Arabidopsis thaliana SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL) protein.</li>\n<li>Arabidopsis thaliana GIBBERELLIN-ACID INSENSITIVE (GAI) and REPRESSOR OF GA1 (RGA), two closely related proteins involved in gibberellin signaling.</li>\n<li>Arabidopsis thaliana SHORT ROOT (SHR) protein. It is necessary for cell division and endodermis specification.</li>\n<li>Arabidopsis thaliana PAT1 protein. It inhibits light signaling via the phytochrome A (phyA).</li>\n<li>LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LS), a protein from tomato that controls the formation of lateral branches during vegetative development.</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5hyz", "name" "Crystal Structure of SCL7 in Oryza sativa"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31636" "OSJNBA0084A10.13 PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "profile" {"PS50985" "GRAS family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF03514" "GRAS domain family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor GRAS", "short" "TF_GRAS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 231, "proteomes" 301, "taxa" 2214, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26153, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25915, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15319}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC50985", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC50985"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005202", :literature {"PUB00008373" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Bolle C" "Koncz C" "Chua NH."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/10/1269", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "PAT1, a new member of the GRAS family, is involved in phytochrome A signal transduction.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1269-78", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10817761}, "PUB00008372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pysh LD" "Wysocka-Diller JW" "Camilleri C" "Bouchez D" "Benfey PN."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00431.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The GRAS gene family in Arabidopsis: sequence characterization and basic expression analysis of the SCARECROW-LIKE genes.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "111-9", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10341448}, "PUB00066769" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Zhang D" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Bioinformatics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts464", "medline_journal" "Bioinformatics", "title" "Bacterial GRAS domain proteins throw new light on gibberellic acid response mechanisms.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "2407-11", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22829623}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005202", "name" "Transcription factor GRAS", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 30, "alignment:full" 14042}}}
