{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins represents HapK, a protein of unknown function, with two homologues PigK and RedY. The monomer structure of the protein contains a four-stranded anti parallel β-sheet, three α-helices and a short C-terminal tail which it uses for dimer formation [[cite:PUB00047880]]. The surface of HapK has a deep cavity with consists of a kinked helix and a β-four strand. HapK could be involved in prodigiosin biosynthesis, specifically the binding of a bipyrrole intermediate such as HBM or MBM [[cite:PUB00047880]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jdj", "name" "crystal structure of HapK from Hahella chejuensis"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11639" "REDY-like protein HapK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "REDY-like protein HapK", "short" "HapK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 159, "taxa" 807, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 521, "sets" 0, "proteins" 520, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 407}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021667", :literature {"PUB00047880" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cho HJ" "Kim KJ" "Kim MH" "Kang BS."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.21582", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Structural insight of the role of the Hahella chejuensis HapK protein in prodigiosin biosynthesis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "257-62", "volume" "70", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17729271}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021667", "name" "REDY-like protein HapK", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 163}}}
