{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the GATOR complex protein MIOS, a component of the GATOR subcomplex GATOR2.  The GATOR2 complex consists of MIOS, SEC13, SEH1L, WDR24 and WDR59, and it activates mTORC1 and the TORC1 signalling pathway through the inhibition of the GATOR1 subcomplex [[cite:PUB00085662]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Sea4 from budding yeasts. Sea4 is a subunit of SEACAT, a subcomplex of the SEA complex. It inhibits the TORC1 inhibitory role of the Iml1p/SEACIT (Iml1-Npr2-Npr3) subcomplex [[cite:PUB00087311]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16453" "WD40 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN MIO FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MIOS/Sea4", "short" "MIOS/Sea4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2185, "taxa" 7727, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3975, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3975, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2516}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2029"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037593", :literature {"PUB00085662" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6136", "authors" ["Bar-Peled L" "Chantranupong L" "Cherniack AD" "Chen WW" "Ottina KA" "Grabiner BC" "Spear ED" "Carter SL" "Meyerson M" "Sabatini DM."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1232044", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "A Tumor suppressor complex with GAP activity for the Rag GTPases that signal amino acid sufficiency to mTORC1.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1100-6", "volume" "340", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23723238}, "PUB00087311" {"URL" nil, "issue" "277", "authors" ["Panchaud N" "Peli-Gulli MP" "De Virgilio C."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Signal", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.2004112", "medline_journal" "Sci Signal", "title" "Amino acid deprivation inhibits TORC1 through a GTPase-activating protein complex for the Rag family GTPase Gtr1.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "ra42", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23716719}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR037593", "name" "MIOS/Sea4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
