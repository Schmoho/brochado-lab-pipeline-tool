{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein family of unknown function found in various bacterial phage proteins. The family typically consists of proteins around 140-160 amino acids in length. It is found in phages that infect bacteria such as Salmonella, Escherichia, Shigella, and Dickeya. The function of this family remains unclear.  Some members of this family are annotated as uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins.  AlphaFold predictions suggest the proteins in this family contain two distinct domains, with a central domain composed of a three stranded beta sheet and a C-terminal small 3-helix bundle domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24224" "Family of unknown function (DUF7440)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7440", "short" "DUF7440"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 249, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055863", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055863", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7440", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 25}}}
