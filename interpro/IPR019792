{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) (gonadoliberin) are a family of peptides that play a pivotal role in reproduction. The main function of GnRH is to act on the pituitary to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, but GnRH also acts on the brain, retina, sympathetic nervous system, gonads and placenta in certain species. There seems to be at least three forms of GnRH [[cite:PUB00092644]]. The second form is expressed in midbrain and seems to be widespread. The third form has only been found so far in fish. GnRH is a C-terminal amidated decapeptide processed from a larger precursor protein. Four of the ten residues are perfectly conserved in all species where GnRH has been sequenced.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10522" "GONADOLIBERIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gonadoliberin", "short" "Gonadoliberin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 580, "taxa" 2204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1394, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1394, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1081}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019792", :literature {"PUB00092644" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Okubo K" "Nagahama Y."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Physiol (Oxf)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01832.x", "medline_journal" "Acta Physiol (Oxf)", "title" "Structural and functional evolution of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in vertebrates.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "3-15", "volume" "193", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18284378}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019792", "name" "Gonadoliberin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004079", "name" "Gonadoliberin I precursor", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
