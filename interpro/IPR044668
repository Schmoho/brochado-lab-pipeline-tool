{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolases and related proteins mostly from bacteria, archaea and plants, including PuuD from E. coli and Cj1417c from Campylobacter jejuni. They belong to the peptidase C26 family. PuuD is involved in the breakdown of putrescine via hydrolysis of the gamma-glutamyl linkage of gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate [[cite:PUB00096741], [cite:PUB00096745]]. Cj1417c catalyses the hydrolysis of CDP-L-glutamine to L-glutamate and cytidine diphosphoramidate [[cite:PUB00096744]] and is involved in the biosynthesis of the O-methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) group found on the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of C.jejuni [[cite:PUB00096743]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7d4r", "name" "SpuA native structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43235" "GLUTAMINE AMIDOTRANSFERASE PB2B2.05-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase C26, gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyrate hydrolase PuuD-like", "short" "PuuD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4888, "taxa" 19456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27783, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27783, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20788}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
