{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the Poxvirus rifampicin resistance protein (Scaffold protein OPG125), a scaffold protein which forms a transitory spherical honeycomb lattice providing curvature and rigidity to the convex membrane of crescent and immature virions (IV). This association occurs concomitantly with viral membrane formation. It is targeted by the drug rifampicin, which prevents the formation of this lattice, and hence virus morphogenesis. In the presence of rifampicin, irregularly shaped membranes that lack the honeycomb layer accumulate around areas of electron-dense viroplasm. This layer is lost from virions during maturation from IV to mature virion (MV), through the proteolysis of OPG158 N terminus [[cite:PUB00103569], [cite:PUB00103570]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9ikc", "name" "Orf virus scaffolding protein Orfv075"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03340" "Poxvirus rifampicin resistance protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus rifampicin-resistance", "short" "Poxvirus_Rif-R"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 41, "taxa" 200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005008", :literature {"PUB00103570" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hyun J" "Matsunami H" "Kim TG" "Wolf M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Assembly mechanism of the pleomorphic immature poxvirus scaffold.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "1704", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35361762}, "PUB00103569" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Bisht H" "Weisberg AS" "Szajner P" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Assembly and disassembly of the capsid-like external scaffold of immature virions during vaccinia virus morphogenesis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "9140-50", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19570860}, "PUB00007238" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Osborne RJ" "Symonds TM" "Sriskantha A" "Lai-Fook J" "Fernon CA" "Dall DJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
