{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In animals, Targeting Protein for Xklp2 (TPX2)  is critical for mitotic spindle assembly. It has a highly conserved TPX2 central domain, an Aurora-A binding domain and a TPX2_C domain that contains a conserved pentapeptide KLEEK motif. However, in plants besides the TPX2 homologue (with three domains), several proteins were found with only the TPX2_C domain. This group of TPX2_C domain only proteins in plants has been named as WDL (or WVD2-like) proteins, as the first identified member is known as WVD2. These WDL proteins bind to microtubules; however, they have lost the function of targeting Xklp2 and were found to play roles in plant development and responses to environment cues [[cite:PUB00095512], [cite:PUB00097176]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes WDL5/6 from Arabidopsis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31358" "PROTEIN WVD2-LIKE 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein WVD2-like 5/6", "short" "WDL5/6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 214, "taxa" 795, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1377, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1377, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 858}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044833", :literature {"PUB00095512" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yuen CY" "Pearlman RS" "Silo-Suh L" "Hilson P" "Carroll KL" "Masson PH" "Masson PH."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "WVD2 and WDL1 modulate helical organ growth and anisotropic cell expansion in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "493-506", "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12586874}, "PUB00097176" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sun J" "Ma Q" "Mao T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Ethylene Regulates the Arabidopsis Microtubule-Associated Protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 in Etiolated Hypocotyl Elongation.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "325-37", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26134166}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008017", "name" "microtubule binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044833", "name" "Protein WVD2-like 5/6", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
