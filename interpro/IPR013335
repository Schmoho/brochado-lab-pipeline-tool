{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Trp repressor (TrpR) binds to at least five operators in the Escherichia coli genome, repressing gene expression. The operators at which it binds vary considerably in DNA sequence and location within the promoter; when bound to the Trp operon it recognises the sequence 5'-ACTAGT-3' and acts to prevent the initiation of transcription. The TrpR controls the trpEDCBA (trpO) operon and the genes for trpR, aroH, mtr and aroL, which are involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of the amino acid tryptophan [[cite:PUB00013953]]. The repressor binds to the operators only in the presence of L-tryptophan, thereby controlling the intracellular level of its effector; the complex also regulates Trp repressor biosynthesis by binding to its own regulatory region. TrpR acts as a dimer that is composed of identical 6-helical subunits, where four of the helices form the core of the protein and intertwine with the corresponding helices from the other subunit.</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents Trp repressors found in proteobacterial and chlamydial species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tro", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF TRP REPRESSOR OPERATOR COMPLEX AT ATOMIC RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010921", "name" "Trp repressor/replication initiator", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038116", "name" "TrpR-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38025" "TRP OPERON REPRESSOR"}, "hamap" {"MF_00475" "Trp operon repressor [trpR]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003196" "Trp repressor"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01321" "trp operon repressor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trp repressor, bacterial", "short" "Trp_repress_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 377, "taxa" 2727, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2527, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2527, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2016}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0037"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013335", :literature {"PUB00013953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["Jaseja M" "Jeeves M" "Hyde EI."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi020072y", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Trp repressor-operator binding: NMR and electrophoretic mobility shift studies of the effect of DNA sequence and corepressor binding on two Trp repressor-operator complexes.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "14866-78", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12475235}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000831", "name" "Trp repressor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR013335", "name" "Trp repressor, bacterial", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR013368", "name" "TrpR homologue YerC/YecD", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
