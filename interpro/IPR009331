{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial proteins which are homologous to the oligogalacturonate-specific porin protein KdgM ([swissprot:Q934G3]) from Erwinia chrysanthemi. The phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria E. chrysanthemi secretes pectinases, which are able to degrade the pectic polymers of plant cell walls, and uses the degradation products as a carbon source for growth. KdgM is a major outer membrane protein, whose synthesis is strongly induced in the presence of pectic derivatives. KdgM behaves like a voltage-dependent porin that is slightly selective for anions and that exhibits fast block in the presence of trigalacturonate. In contrast to most porins, KdgM seems to be monomeric [[cite:PUB00012278]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wjq", "name" "NanC porin structure in hexagonal crystal form."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053713", "name" "Bacterial Outer Membrane Channel Superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06178" "Oligogalacturonate-specific porin protein (KdgM)"}, "panther" {"PTHR38105" "OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEIN-RELATED-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oligogalacturonate-specific porin", "short" "Oligogalacturonate-sp_porin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 144, "taxa" 1502, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4169, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4158, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3400}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009331", :literature {"PUB00012278" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Blot N" "Berrier C" "Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N" "Ghazi A" "Condemine G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
