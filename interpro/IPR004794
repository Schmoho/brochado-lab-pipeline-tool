The C-terminal domain is homologous to the full length of yeast HTP reductase, a protein required for riboflavin biosynthesis. A number of archaeal proteins that may be related to the riboflavin biosynthesis protein contain only the C-terminal domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hxv", "name" "Crystal structure of a diaminohydroxyphosphoribosylaminopyrimidine deaminase/ 5-amino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)uracil reductase (tm1828) from thermotoga maritima at 1.80 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024072", "name" "Dihydrofolate reductase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00326" "bifunctional diaminohydroxyphosphoribosylaminopyrimidine deaminase/5-amino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)uracil reductase RibD"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006769" "Riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibD", "short" "Eubact_RibD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7926, "taxa" 30589, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36890, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35816, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27118}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1734", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1734"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
