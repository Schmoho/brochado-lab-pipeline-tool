{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family bind to fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is capable of binding to a wide number of endogenous proteins and cell receptors during haemostasis, including binding to platelets to promote their aggregation [[cite:PUB00017188]]. Included in this family is receptor FbsA ([swissprot:Q8GIU3]) from the pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae, which is responsible for causing endocarditis in humans. FbsA is considered an important virulence factor that is capable of binding fibrinogen, through which it elicits platelet aggregation and adherence to the extracellular matrix. This enables the bacteria to invade the pulmonary epithelium, which may be a prerequisite for infection [[cite:PUB00016552]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08017" "Fibrinogen binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fibrinogen binding protein", "short" "Fibrinogen_BP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 56, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 702, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 295, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 85}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012969", :literature {"PUB00017188" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Weisel JW."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
