{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of examples of the single chain form of dihydroxyacetone kinase (also called glycerone kinase) that uses ATP ([ec:2.7.1.29]) as the phosphate donor, rather than a phosphoprotein as in Escherichia coli. This form has separable domains homologous to the K and L subunits of the E. coli enzyme, and is found in yeasts and other eukaryotes and in some bacteria, including Citrobacter freundii [[cite:PUB00060926], [cite:PUB00017762]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The member from tomato has been shown to phosphorylate dihydroxyacetone, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone, and some other aldoses and ketoses [[cite:PUB00016695]]. Members from mammals have been shown to catalyse both the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone and the splitting of ribonucleoside diphosphate-X compounds among which FAD is the best substrate [[cite:PUB00060927]]. In yeast there are two isozymes of dihydroxyacetone kinase (Dak1 and Dak2). They are required for detoxification of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) [[cite:PUB00060928]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02361" "glycerone kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihydroxyacetone kinase", "short" "DhaK_ATP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1650, "taxa" 5404, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3872, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3872, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2378}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
