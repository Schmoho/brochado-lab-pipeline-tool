{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents TraI, which is a component of the relaxosome complex. In the process of conjugative plasmid transfer the relaxosome binds to the plasmid at the oriT (origin of transfer) site. The relaxase protein TraI mediates the single-strand nicking and ATP-dependent unwinding (relaxation, helicase activity) of the plasmid molecule. These two activities reside in separate domains of the protein [[cite:PUB00034404], [cite:PUB00091215]]. TraI contains four domains: a trans-esterase (relaxase) domain that executes the nicking and covalent attachment of the T-strand to the relaxase, a vestigial helicase domain (carrying the 2B/2B-like sub-domain) that operates as an ssDNA-binding domain, an active 5' to 3' helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain that functions as a recruitment platform for relaxosome components.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02760" "conjugative transfer relaxase/helicase TraI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conjugative transfer relaxase protein TraI", "short" "Conjug_relaxase_TraI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 513, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1260, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1260, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 79}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0484", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0484"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
