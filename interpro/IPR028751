{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CATSPER (cationic channel of sperm) is a complex ion channel that mediates Ca2+ entry in sperm flagellum and is required for sperm hyperactivation and male fertility [[cite:PUB00069143]]. The CATSPER channel consists of four CatSper proteins (CatSper1-4) that form a tetramer surrounding a Ca(2+)-selective pore. In addition to the pore-forming proteins, the CATSPER channel contains auxiliary subunits, including CatSperD (cation channel sperm-associated protein subunit delta) [[cite:PUB00067741]] and CatSperE. CatSperD is essential for the cation channel function and may play a role in channel assembly or transport.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33722" "CATION CHANNEL SPERM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN SUBUNIT DELTA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cation channel sperm-associated auxiliary subunit delta/epsilon", "short" "CATSPERD/E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 236, "taxa" 952, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 832, "sets" 0, "proteins" 832, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 506}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028751", :literature {"PUB00067741" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Chung JJ" "Navarro B" "Krapivinsky G" "Krapivinsky L" "Clapham DE."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1153", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "A novel gene required for male fertility and functional CATSPER channel formation in spermatozoa.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "153", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21224844}, "PUB00069143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6856", "authors" ["Ren D" "Navarro B" "Perez G" "Jackson AC" "Hsu S" "Shi Q" "Tilly JL" "Clapham DE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35098027", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A sperm ion channel required for sperm motility and male fertility.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "603-9", "volume" "413", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11595941}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0036128", "name" "CatSper complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR028751", "name" "Cation channel sperm-associated auxiliary subunit delta/epsilon", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
