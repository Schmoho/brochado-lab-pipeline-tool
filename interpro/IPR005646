{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include FapA (flagellar assembly protein A), [swissprot:Q7MBR0], found in Vibrio vulnificus. The synthesis of flagella allows bacteria to respond to chemotaxis by facilitating motility. Studies examining the role of FapA show that the loss or delocalization of FapA results in a complete failure of the flagellar biosynthesis and motility in response to glucose mediated chemotaxis. The polar localization of FapA is required for flagellar synthesis, and dephosphorylated EIIAGlc (Glucose-permease IIA component) inhibited the polar localization of FapA through direct interaction [[cite:PUB00085059]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38032" "POLYMERASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar assembly protein A", "short" "FapA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1344, "taxa" 5493, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7171, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7171, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5630}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005646", :literature {"PUB00085059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Park S" "Park YH" "Lee CR" "Kim YR" "Seok YJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
