{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes GDGT/MA synthase (MJ0619, formerly known as 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin dimethyltransferase) and its homologues mostly from archaea. This is the pioneer enzyme of class D radical S-adenosylmethionine methylases (RSMT) subclass.</p>\n\n<p>The MJ0619 protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii was first thought to be responsible for catalysing the methylation at both C-7 and C-9 of the 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin substrate [[cite:PUB00083593]]. However, this could not be corroborated and the X-ray structure of MJ0619 revealed that this enzyme is, actually, involved in isoprenoid-based ether-linked membrane lipids synthesis and catalyses the biphytanyl chain formation between the termini of two lipid tails within one glycerophospholipid to generate the macrocyclic archaeol or between the termini of two lipid tails from two glycerophospholipids to generate the macrocycle glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT). These lipids enable archaea to resist extreme environmental conditions. Therefore, MJ0619 has been renamed GDGT/MA synthase or GDGT/MAS. It contains three Fe4-S4 clusters and a mononuclear rubredoxin-type Fe2/3 cofactor [[cite:PUB00101308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7tom", "name" "X-ray crystal structure of glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether - macrocyclic archaeol synthase (GDGT-MAS) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii with bacterial lipid substrate analog, 5'deoxyadenosine, and methionine bound"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045702" "tetraether lipid synthase Tes"}, "sfld" {"SFLDF00385" "7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin dimethylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDGT/MA synthase", "short" "GDGT/MA_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 156, "taxa" 1424, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1731, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1731, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1484}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
