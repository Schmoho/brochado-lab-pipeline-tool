{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The adaptor protein 3BP2/SH3BP2 is a cytoplasmic adaptor that contributes to the regulation of immune responses [[cite:PUB00086326]]. The protein-tyrosine kinase Syk phosphorylates 3BP2 which results in the activation of Rac1 through the interaction with the SH2 domain of Vav1 and induces the binding to the SH2 domain of the upstream protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn and enhances its kinase activity [[cite:PUB00086328]]. 3BP2 has a positive regulatory role in IgE-mediated mast cell activation [[cite:PUB00086326]]. In lymphocytes, engagement of T cell or B cell receptors triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 [[cite:PUB00086329]]. 3BP2 is required for the proliferation of B cells and B cell receptor signaling. Mutations in the 3BP2 gene are responsible for cherubism resulting in excessive bone resorption in the jaw [[cite:PUB00086327]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15126" "SH3-BINDING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SH3 domain-binding protein 2", "short" "SH3BP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 672, "taxa" 2435, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1493, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1493, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 940}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035848", :literature {"PUB00086329" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Qu X" "Kawauchi-Kamata K" "Miah SM" "Hatani T" "Yamamura H" "Sada K."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1021/bi048353o", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor protein 3BP2 induces T cell receptor-mediated activation of transcription factor.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3891-8", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15751964}, "PUB00086328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Levaot N" "Voytyuk O" "Dimitriou I" "Sircoulomb F" "Chandrakumar A" "Deckert M" "Krzyzanowski PM" "Scotter A" "Gu S" "Janmohamed S" "Cong F" "Simoncic PD" "Ueki Y" "La Rose J" "Rottapel R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.045", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Loss of Tankyrase-mediated destruction of 3BP2 is the underlying pathogenic mechanism of cherubism.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1324-39", "volume" "147", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22153076}, "PUB00086327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hatani T" "Sada K."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
