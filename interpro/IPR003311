{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Aux/IAA proteins are key regulators of auxin-modulated gene expression [[cite:PUB00014766]]. The plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) regulates diverse cellular and developmental responses in plants, including cell division, expansion, differentiation and patterning of embryo responses [[cite:PUB00014762]]. Auxin can regulate the gene expression of several families, including GH3 and SAUR, as well as Aux/IAA itself. The Aux/IAA proteins act as repressors of auxin-induced gene expression, possibly through modulating the activity of DNA-binding auxin response factors (ARFs). Aux/IAA and ARF are thought to interact through C-terminal protein-protein interaction domains found in both Aux/IAA and ARF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent evidence suggests that Aux/IAA proteins can also mediate light responses [[cite:PUB00014763]]. Some members of the Aux/IAA family are longer and contain an N-terminal DNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00008092]] and may have an early function in the establishment of vascular and body patterns in embryonic and post-embryonic development in some plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31734" "AUXIN-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN IAA17"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AUX/IAA protein", "short" "AUX_IAA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 252, "taxa" 1155, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13335, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13335, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8292}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003311", :literature {"PUB00014762" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kulaeva ON" "Prokoptseva OS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry Mosc.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BIRY.0000022053.73461.cd", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry (Mosc)", "title" "Recent advances in the study of mechanisms of action of phytohormones.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "233-47", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15061689}, "PUB00014763" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Reed JW."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Plant Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1360-1385(01)02042-8", "medline_journal" "Trends Plant Sci", "title" "Roles and activities of Aux/IAA proteins in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "420-5", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11544131}, "PUB00008092" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Hardtke CS" "Berleth T."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/17.5.1405", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The Arabidopsis gene MONOPTEROS encodes a transcription factor mediating embryo axis formation and vascular development.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "1405-11", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9482737}, "PUB00014766" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3-4", "authors" ["Liscum E" "Reed JW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
