{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the single capsid protein of infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), found particularly in shrimp densovirus. Densoviruses are a subfamily of the parvoviruses.  The capsid protein has an eight-stranded anti-parallel Î²-barrel 'jelly roll' motif similar to that found in many icosahedral viruses, including other parvoviruses. The N-terminal portion of the IHHNV coat protein adopts a 'domain-swappe' conformation relative to its twofold-related neighbour.  The loops connecting the strands of the structurally conserved jelly roll motif differ considerably in structure and length from those of other parvoviruses. IHHNV was first reported as a highly lethal disease of juvenile shrimp in 1983, and has only one type of capsid protein that lacks the phospholipase A2 activity that has been implicated as a requirement during parvoviral host cell infection. The structure of recombinant virus-like particles, composed of 60 copies of the 37.5kDa coat protein is the smallest parvoviral capsid protein reported thus far. The small size of the PstDNV capsid protein makes the system attractive as a model for studying assembly mechanisms of icosahedral virus capsids [[cite:PUB00076301]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16530" "Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus, capsid"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus, capsid protein", "short" "IHHNV_capsid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 58, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 162, "sets" 0, "proteins" 162, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032398", :literature {"PUB00076301" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Kaufmann B" "Bowman VD" "Li Y" "Szelei J" "Waddell PJ" "Tijssen P" "Rossmann MG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
