{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of BTB/POZ domain-containing proteins, such as BACURD1-3 from humans. They act as the substrate-specific adapters of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of RhoA, leading to its degradation by the proteasome [[cite:PUB00097976]]. This entry also includes EAP3 from Arabidopsis. The BTB/POZ domain of EAP3 displays poor conservation of the residues required for CUL3 binding and is not likely to function as an E3 ligase adaptor [[cite:PUB00097978]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11145" "BTB/POZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING ADAPTER FOR CUL3-MEDIATED RHOA DEGRADATION PROTEIN FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BTB/POZ domain-containing adapter for CUL3-mediated RhoA degradation protein 1-3", "short" "BACURD1-3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1558, "taxa" 8260, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8362, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8362, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4545}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045068", :literature {"PUB00097976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Chen Y" "Yang Z" "Meng M" "Zhao Y" "Dong N" "Yan H" "Liu L" "Ding M" "Peng HB" "Shao F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Cullin mediates degradation of RhoA through evolutionarily conserved BTB adaptors to control actin cytoskeleton structure and cell movement.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "841-55", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19782033}, "PUB00097978" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Mao H" "Aryal B" "Langenecker T" "Hagmann J" "Geisler M" "Grebe M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Plants", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Plants", "title" "Arabidopsis BTB/POZ protein-dependent PENETRATION3 trafficking and disease susceptibility.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "854-858", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29085068}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045068", "name" "BTB/POZ domain-containing adapter for CUL3-mediated RhoA degradation protein 1-3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
