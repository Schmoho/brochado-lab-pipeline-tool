{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase ([ec:4.1.2.13]) [[cite:PUB00000567], [cite:PUB00005383]] is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyses the reversible aldol cleavage or condensation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. There are two classes of fructose-bisphosphate aldolases with different catalytic mechanisms: class I enzymes [[cite:PUB00000463]] do not require a metal ion, and are characterised by the formation of a Schiff base intermediate between a highly conserved active site lysine and a substrate carbonyl group, while the class II enzymes require an active-site divalent metal ion.</p>\n<p>This entry represents class I enzymes from Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00949" "Fructose-1.6-bisphosphate aldolase found in gram +/- bacteria"}, "hamap" {"MF_00729" "Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class 1 [fda]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class I, Gram-positive bacteria-type", "short" "FBA_I_Gram+-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 202, "taxa" 919, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 751, "sets" 0, "proteins" 751, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 632}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
