{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CoA-transferases catalyse the reversible transfer of of coenzyme A from CoA-thioesters to free acids, and can be divided into three families [[cite:PUB00019325]]. Family I includes transferases for 3-oxoacids ([ec:2.8.3.5], [ec:2.8.3.6]), short-chain fatty acids ([ec:2.8.3.8], [ec:2.8.3.9]) and glutaconate ([ec:2.8.3.12]). Most of the family I enzymes use acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA as CoA donors, and are composed of two separate polypeptides, subunits A and B, which generally aggregate as heterodimers or heterotetramers. The eukaryotic enzymes, however, are generally composed of a single two-domain polypetide representing a fusion of the A and B subunits. The transfer of CoA from one substrate to another occurs via a ping pong mechanism which involves the formation of thioester bond between CoA and a conserved glutamate residue at the active site of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00028140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferases, many of which are mitochondrial.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3k6m", "name" "Dynamic domains of Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase from pig heart."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000858" "3-oxoacid CoA-transferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-oxoacid CoA-transferase", "short" "3-oxoacid_CoA-transferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2844, "taxa" 11542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11011, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7519}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
