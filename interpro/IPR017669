{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzyme that catalyses the final step in methanogenesis, methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR), contains alpha, beta, and gamma chains [[cite:PUB00006391]]. In older literature, the complex of alpha, beta, and gamma chains was termed component C, while this single chain protein was termed component A2 of the methyl coenzyme M reductase system [[cite:PUB00042996]]. The MCR systems is formed of 3 components: A, B (HS-CoB) and C (MCR itself). Component A contains A1, an F420-reducing hydrogenase; A2, an ATP-binding protein; A3a, an uncharacterized iron-containing protein; and A3b, a methyl-viologen-reducing (F420-nonreducing) hydrogenase [[cite:PUB00093738]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03269" "methyl coenzyme M reductase system, component A2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyl coenzyme M reductase system, component A2", "short" "Me_Coenz_M_Rdtase_A2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 77, "taxa" 621, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 687, "sets" 0, "proteins" 687, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 603}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0722"} {"accession" "GenProp0719", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0719"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017669", :literature {"PUB00042996" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kuhner CH" "Lindenbach BD" "Wolfe RS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
