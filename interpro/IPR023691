{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energise diverse biological systems. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Most bacterial importers employ a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (PBP) that delivers the ligand to the extracellular gate of the TM domains. These proteins bind their substrates selectively and with high affinity, which is thought to ensure the specificity of the transport reaction. Binding proteins in Gram-negative bacteria are present within the periplasm, whereas those in Gram-positive bacteria are tethered to the cell membrane via the acylation of a cysteine residue that is an integral component of a lipoprotein signal sequence.
