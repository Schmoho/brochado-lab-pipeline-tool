{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TssC (also known as VipB) is a family of Gram-negative type VI secretion system components of the tail sheath. They have been known as COG3517. These sheath-components, of which there are many copies in the sheath, are also variously referred to as TssC. On contact with another bacterial cell the sheath contracts and pushes the puncturing device and tube through the cell envelope and punches the target bacterial cell [[cite:PUB00090998]]. VipA and VipB (TssB and TssC) proteins were shown to form a cog-wheel like tubular structure in V. cholerae that was noticed to resemble T4 phage gp18 polysheath. Two β-strands of VipA and four β-strands of VipB intertwine forming the middle layer of the sheath. The sheath assembles around an inner Hcp tube and is attached to a structure called a baseplate that spans the bacterial membranes. Importantly, VipA/VipB sheath was shown to form a long contractile organelle in V. cholerae and in E. coli, suggesting that sheath contraction powers the secretion [[cite:PUB00091000]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes TssC mostly from Bacteroidetes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a supra-molecular bacterial complex that resembles phage tails. It is a toxin delivery systems which fires toxins into target cells upon contraction of its TssBC sheath [[cite:PUB00093972]].  Thirteen essential core proteins are conserved in all T6SSs: the membrane associated complex TssJ-TssL-TssM, the baseplate proteins TssE, TssF, TssG, and TssK, the bacteriophage-related puncturing complex composed of the tube (Hcp), the tip/puncturing device VgrG, and the contractile sheath structure (TssB and TssC). Finally, the starfish-shaped dodecameric protein, TssA, limits contractile sheath polymerization at its distal part when TagA captures TssA [[cite:PUB00093973]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17541" "Type VI secretion system, TssC, VipB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type VI secretion system TssC", "short" "T6SS_TssC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 179, "taxa" 947, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 876, "sets" 0, "proteins" 876, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 703}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035576", :literature {"PUB00090998" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Coyne MJ" "Roelofs KG" "Comstock LE."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Genomics", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-2377-z", "medline_journal" "BMC Genomics", "title" "Type VI secretion systems of human gut Bacteroidales segregate into three genetic architectures, two of which are contained on mobile genetic elements.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "58", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26768901}, "PUB00091000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kudryashev M" "Wang RY" "Brackmann M" "Scherer S" "Maier T" "Baker D" "DiMaio F" "Stahlberg H" "Egelman EH" "Basler M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.037", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure of the type VI secretion system contractile sheath.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "952-962", "volume" "160", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25723169}, "PUB00093973" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Liebl D" "Robert-Genthon M" "Job V" "Cogoni V" "Attree I."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "Baseplate Component TssK and Spatio-Temporal Assembly of T6SS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1615", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31379775}, "PUB00093972" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Planamente S" "Salih O" "Manoli E" "Albesa-Jove D" "Freemont PS" "Filloux A."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "TssA forms a gp6-like ring attached to the type VI secretion sheath.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1613-27", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27288401}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0033103", "name" "protein secretion by the type VI secretion system", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0033104", "name" "type VI protein secretion system complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035576", "name" "Type VI secretion system TssC", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 199}}}
