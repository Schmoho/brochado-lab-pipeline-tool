{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents pyruvate Pi dikinase (PPDK) regulatory protein found in chloroplasts, which acts as a bifunctional serine/threonine kinase ([ec:2.7.11]) and a phosphorylase ([ec:2.7.4]) [[cite:PUB00044657]]. This enzyme is involved in the dark/light-mediated regulation of PPDK by catalysing its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Dark/light-induced changes in stromal concentrations of the competing ADP and Pi substrates govern the direction of the reaction. In the dark, it phosphorylates the catalytic intermediate of PPDK (PPDK-HisP), thereby inactivating it. Light exposure induces the phosphorolysis reaction that reactivates PPDK. Unlike the kinase function which can utilise either Thr or Ser as a target, the phosphorylase function has a strict substrate requirement for threonyl phosphate [[cite:PUB00060650], [cite:PUB00060651], [cite:PUB00060649]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038149" "Pyruvate Pi dikinase regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyruvate Pi dikinase regulator, chloroplast", "short" "Pyrv_Pi_dikinase_reg_chlpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 82, "sets" 0, "proteins" 80, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 58}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
