{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MAP Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) are members of the dual specificity phosphatase family [[cite:PUB00056895], [cite:PUB00056896]]. MKPs constitute a class of phosphatases that reverse the activation of MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinases by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine and threonine residues [[cite:PUB00011585]]. This regulation is mediated via interaction of a Kinase Interaction Motif (KIM) with the common docking domain of the kinase -this motif is shared with a number of other protein families that interact with MAP kinases: these include kinases (MEKs), phosphatases (PTP-SL) and transcription factors (Elk1). MKPs also share an active site motif with the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Different MKPs exhibit specificity towards different members of the MAP kinase family [[cite:PUB00011587]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of the MPK catalytic domain is similar to that of the PTPs -the fold exhibits a complex mixed α/β-architecture. The catalytic mechanism involves a general acid (Asp92 in 1VHR) and a catalytic cysteine (130 in 1VHR), which acts as a nucleophile.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000939" "Dual specificity protein phosphatase (MAP kinase phosphatase)"}, "prints" {"PR01764" "MAPKPHPHTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase", "short" "MKP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 947, "taxa" 3820, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8530, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5707}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
