{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains a SAM (S-adenosyl methyltransferase) domain, with a central β sheet with 3 α-helices on both sides. Crystal packing analysis of the structure of [swissprot:Q82L35] suggests that a monomer is the solution state oligomeric form. An unidentified ligand (UNL, cyan) was found at the putative active site surrounded by the residues His57, His170, Phe171, Tyr216 and Met22. The UNL is likely to be a phenylalanine or phenylalanine-like molecule.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3giw", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF a DUF574 family protein (SAV_2177) FROM STREPTOMYCES AVERMITILIS MA-4680 AT 1.45 A RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017393" "Predicted S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferase, SAV2177 type"}, "pfam" {"PF04672" "S-adenosyl methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferase, SAV2177 type", "short" "SAM_dep_MeTrfase_SAV2177_type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 886, "taxa" 2646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18190, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13551}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006764", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006764", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferase, SAV2177 type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 12, "alignment:full" 7919}}}
