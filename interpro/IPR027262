{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase (PTP) alpha ([ec:3.1.3.48]). PTP catalyses the dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine phosphate to protein tyrosine, and appear to play a pivotal role in insulin receptor signalling. It can exist as a single-pass membrane protein or in the cytoplasm. PTP-alpha is as a positive regulator of Src and Src family kinases, acting to dephosphorylate and activate Src. As such, PTP-alpha affects transformation and tumourigenesis, inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle arrest, mitotic activation of Src, integrin signalling, neuronal differentiation and outgrowth, and ion channel activity [[cite:PUB00042878]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500808" "Receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase alpha", "short" "Tyr_Pase_rcpt_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 471, "taxa" 1719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1107, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1069, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 694}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
