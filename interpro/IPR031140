{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of plant-specific transcription factors including protein indeterminate-domain 1-16 (IDD1-16) from Arabidopsis containing the conserved INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) with four zinc finger motifs. These proteins are involved in regulation of multiple developmental processes [[cite:PUB00092640], [cite:PUB00101451]]. IDD8/NUC, IDD3/MAGPIE (MAG), and IDD10/JACKDAW (JKD) regulate root development and patterning [[[cite:PUB00092640], [cite:PUB00074753], [cite:PUB00043153]]. IDD8/NUTCRACKER (NUC) also regulates photoperiodic flowering by modulating sugar transport and metabolism [[cite:PUB00074758]]. IDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 5 (SGR5) is involved in the gravitropic response of inflorescence stems. INDETERMINATE1  plays an important role in regulating the transition to flowering in maize [[cite:PUB00074757]]. This family also includes similar proteins from rice, such as EHD2, which are transcription activators that act as a flowering master switches in both long and short days, independently of the circadian clock [[cite:PUB00101449], [cite:PUB00101450]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10593" "SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE RIO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein indeterminate-domain 1-16", "short" "IDD1-16"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1010, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8625, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8625, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5207}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031140", :literature {"PUB00074753" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4-5", "authors" ["Ogasawara H" "Kaimi R" "Colasanti J" "Kozaki A."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
