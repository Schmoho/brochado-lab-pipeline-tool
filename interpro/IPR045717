{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes chordin-like protein 1/2 (CHRDL1/2). CHRDL1 antagonizes the function of BMP4 by binding to it and preventing its interaction with receptors [[cite:PUB00071691]]. CHRDL2 inhibit bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) activity by blocking their interaction with their receptor [[cite:PUB00071697]]. CHRDL2 may play a role during myoblast and osteoblast differentiation and maturation [[cite:PUB00071696]]. It's worth noting that there are different results regarding its binding partners; according to [[cite:PUB00071696]], CHRDL2 interacts with INHBA but not BMP2, BMP4 and BMP6.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Bone is composed of an organic matrix that is principally collagenous and is mineralised with inorganic crystals of hydroxyapatite. Demineralisation of the bone results in a demineralised bone matrix [[cite:PUB00072633]]. In 1965, Urist M.R demonstrates the decalcified bone matrix (DBM) can induce ectopic bone/cartilage formation [[cite:PUB00072632]]. The morphogens in DBM that induce such skeletogenesis were named as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) [[cite:PUB00072634]]. Since then, more than 20 members of BMPs have been identified.
