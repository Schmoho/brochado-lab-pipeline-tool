{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Choline dehydrogenase catalyses the conversion of exogenously supplied choline into the intermediate glycine betaine aldehyde, as part of a two-step oxidative reaction leading to the formation of osmoprotectant betaine. This enzymatic system can be found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As in Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00013491]], Staphylococcus xylosus [[cite:PUB00013492]], and Rhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti) [[cite:PUB00013493]], this enzyme is found associated in a transcriptionally co-induced gene cluster with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, the second catalytic enzyme in this reaction. Other Gram-positive organisms have been shown to employ a different enzymatic system, utilising a soluble choline oxidase or type III alcohol dehydrogenase instead of choline dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00013494]]. \r\nThis enzyme is a member of the GMC oxidoreductase family, sharing a common evolutionary origin and enzymatic reaction with alcohol dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00003828]]. Out grouping from this model, Caulobacter crescentus (Caulobacter vibrioides) shares sequence homology with choline dehydrogenase, yet other genes participating in this enzymatic reaction have not currently been identified.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00750" "Oxygen-dependent choline dehydrogenase [betA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01810" "choline dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oxygen-dependent choline dehydrogenase", "short" "BetA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2120, "taxa" 8909, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8007, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8007, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6017}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1390", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1390"} {"accession" "GenProp0147", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0147"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
