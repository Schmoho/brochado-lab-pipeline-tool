{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the entire Kv family of voltage-dependent potassium channels.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The Kv family can be divided into several subfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity and function. Four of these subfamilies, Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw) and Kv4 (Shal), consist of pore-forming alpha subunits that associate with different types of beta subunit. Each alpha subunit comprises six hydrophobic TM domains with a P-domain between the fifth and sixth, which partially resides in the membrane. The fourth TM domain has positively charged residues at every third residue and acts as a voltage sensor, which triggers the conformational change that opens the channel pore in response to a displacement in membrane potential [[cite:PUB00009391]]. More recently, 4 new electrically-silent alpha subunits have been cloned: Kv5 (KCNF), Kv6 (KCNG), Kv8 and Kv9 (KCNS). These subunits do not themselves possess any functional activity, but appear to form heteromeric channels with Kv2 subunits, and thus modulate Shab channel activity [[cite:PUB00008322]]. When highly expressed, they inhibit channel activity, but at lower levels show more specific modulatory actions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027359", "name" "Voltage-dependent channel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011333", "name" "SKP1/BTB/POZ domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01491" "KVCHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Potassium channel, voltage dependent, Kv", "short" "K_chnl_volt-dep_Kv"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 56, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1041, "taxa" 8070, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 121063, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32393, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21494}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003968", :literature {"PUB00008322" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Salinas M" "Duprat F" "Heurteaux C" "Hugnot JP" "Lazdunski M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
