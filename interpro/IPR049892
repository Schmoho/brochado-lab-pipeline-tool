{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Although weak endoglucanase activity has been demonstrated in several members of this family [[cite:PUB00079200], [cite:PUB00098632], \n[cite:PUB00098631]], they lack the clustered conserved catalytic acidic amino acids present in most glycoside hydrolases. Many members of this family lack measurable cellulase activity on their own, but enhance the activity of other cellulolytic enzymes. They are therefore unlikely to be true glycoside hydrolases [[cite:PUB00057681]]. The substrate-binding surface of this family is a flat Ig-like fold [[cite:PUB00078763]]. This family of enzymes were originally classified as glycoside hydrolases (GH61) and they have been reclassified as the Auxiliary Activity Family 9 ([cazy:AA9], [[cite:PUB00148242]]) of CAZy.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7pu1", "name" "High resolution X-ray structure of Thermoascus aurantiacus LPMO"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33353" "PUTATIVE (AFU_ORTHOLOGUE AFUA_1G12560)-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Auxiliary Activity family 9", "short" "AA9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 102, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 888, "taxa" 2409, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16583, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9144}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
