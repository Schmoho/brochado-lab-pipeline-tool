{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Ion-translocating oxidoreductase complex subunit G (RnfG, [swissprot:Q8TSY2]) from Methanosarcina acetivorans and related proteins found in Methanosarcinaceae species. RnfG is part of a membrane-bound complex that couples electron transfer with translocation of ions across the membrane. RnfG catalyses sodium transport, most probably coupled to electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to methanophenazine and heterodisulfide reductase. It is involved in heterodisulfide reduction during methanogenesis from acetate [[cite:PUB00152961]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041840" "Rnf electron transport complex subunit RnfG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ion-translocating oxidoreductase complex subunit RnfG, Methanosarcinaceae", "short" "Ion_transpt_RnfG_Methano"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 83, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 56, "sets" 0, "proteins" 56, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
