{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXP synthase) is a regulatory enzyme of the mevalonate-independent pathway involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Terpenoids are plant natural products with important pharmaceutical activity. DXP synthase is a thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme related to transketolase and the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta subunit. DXP synthase is found in bacteria (gene dxs) and plants (gene CLA1) which catalyses the thiamine pyrophosphoate-dependent acyloin condensation reaction between carbon atoms 2 and 3 of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (dxp), a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway to isoprenoids, thiamine (vitamin B1), and pyridoxol (vitamin B6). DXP synthase is evolutionary related to TK. The N-terminal section contains a histidine residue which appears to function in proton transfer during catalysis [[cite:PUB00001222]]. In the central section there are conserved acidic residues that are part of the active cleft and may participate in substrate-binding [[cite:PUB00001222]]. This family includes transketolase enzymes [ec:2.2.1.1], and also partially matches to 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase beta subunit P37941 [ec:1.2.4.4]. Both these enzymes utilise thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor, suggesting there may be common aspects in their mechanism of catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8a9c", "name" "Structure of truncated 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) from Klebsiella pneumoniae in complex with cofactor TPP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029061", "name" "Thiamin diphosphate-binding fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02007" "TPP_DXS"}, "hamap" {"MF_00315" "1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase [dxs]"}, "pfam" {"PF13292" "1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00204" "1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase"}, "panther" {"PTHR43322" "1-D-DEOXYXYLULOSE 5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase", "short" "Dxylulose-5-P_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 93, "proteomes" 8730, "taxa" 33356, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45473, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45280, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33887}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0048", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0048"} {"accession" "GenProp1633", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1633"} {"accession" "GenProp1295", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1295"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
