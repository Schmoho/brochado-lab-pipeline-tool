{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Tubulin polymerization-promoting proteins, formerly known as 25kDa proteins (TPPP/p25) that are phosphorylated by a Ser/Thr-Pro kinase [[cite:PUB00011523]]. Proteins in this family, including TPP and TPP3 from human, are regulators of microtubule dynamics [[cite:PUB00101513], [cite:PUB00101512]]. TPP plays a key role in myelination by promoting elongation of the myelin sheath [[cite:PUB00101513]] and acts as a microtubule nucleation factor in oligodendrocytes; it specifically localizes to the postsynaptic Golgi apparatus region, and promotes microtubule nucleation [[cite:PUB00101513], [cite:PUB00101512]]. TPP3 is required for embryo implantation [[cite:PUB00101514]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011992", "name" "EF-hand domain pair", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05517" "p25-alpha"}, "panther" {"PTHR12932" "P25 ALPHA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tubulin polymerization-promoting protein", "short" "TPP/p25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 121, "proteomes" 1221, "taxa" 4789, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4924, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4676, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3179}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
