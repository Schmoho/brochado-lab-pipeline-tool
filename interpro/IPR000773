{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) is a cytokine that acts in hematopoiesis to stimulate growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells from various lineages including granulocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and erythrocytes [[cite:PUB00000780], [cite:PUB00003283]]. GMCSF is a glycoprotein of ~120 residues that contains 4 conserved cysteines that participate in disulphide bond formation. The crystal structure of recombinant human GMCSF has been determined [[cite:PUB00003283]]. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, which are related by an approximate non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. The overall structure, which is highly compact and globular with a predominantly hydrophobic core, is characterised by a 4-α-helix bundle. The helices are arranged in a left-handed anti-parallel fashion, with two overhand connections. Within the connections is a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The tertiary structure has a topology similar to that of Sus scrofa (pig) growth factor and interferon-beta. Most of the proposed critical regions for receptor binding are located on a continuous surface at one end of the molecule that includes the C terminus [[cite:PUB00003283]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5d22", "name" "Structure of ovine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00040" "CSF2"}, "prosite" {"PS00702" "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signature"}, "smart" {"SM00040" "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor (GM-CSF)"}, "panther" {"PTHR10059" "GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR GM-CSF"}, "prints" {"PR00693" "GMCSFACTOR"}, "pfam" {"PF01109" "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor", "short" "GM_colony-stim-fac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 137, "taxa" 624, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 235, "sets" 0, "proteins" 235, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 162}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00584", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00584"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000773", :literature {"PUB00000780" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Morstyn G" "Burgess AW."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/20/5624", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "Hemopoietic growth factors: a review.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "5624-37", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2458827}, "PUB00003283" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Walter MR" "Cook WJ" "Ealick SE" "Nagabhushan TL" "Trotta PP" "Bugg CE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
