{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.3.3.1]) (DHOdehase) catalyzes the fourth step in the <i>de novo</i>biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the conversion of dihydroorotate into orotate. DHOdehase is a ubiquitous FAD flavoprotein. In bacteria (gene pyrD), DHOdease is located on the inner side of the cytosolic membrane. In some yeasts, such as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (gene URA1, subfamily 2), it is a cytosolic protein while in other eukaryotes it is found in the mitochondria [[cite:PUB00004801]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the electron transfer subunit of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B (NAD(+)) [[cite:PUB00033241]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR039261", "name" "Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR), nucleotide-binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01211" "Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B (NAD(+)), electron transfer subunit [pyrK]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase electron transfer subunit", "short" "Dihydroorotate_DHASE_ETsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1384, "taxa" 6107, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6476, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6476, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4931}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023455", :literature {"PUB00033241" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Nielsen FS" "Andersen PS" "Jensen KF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
