{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>APM2 (adipose specific 2 or adipose most abundant 2), also known as adipogenesis regulatory factor, was so named because it was originally identified as the second most abundant transcript in adipose tissue  [[cite:PUB00083561]]. It up-regulates the levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP-alpha) and PPAR-gamma, and promotes adipogenic differentiation starting from the early stage of adipogenesis. It is thought to be an adipocyte lineage-specific nuclear factor that can modulate the master adipogenesis transcription factors early during differentiation [[cite:PUB00083562]]. It is also involved in regulating glucose transport in adipocytes, as well as regulating the number of preadipocytes [[cite:PUB00083563]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APM2 it is widely dysregulated in various cancers [[cite:PUB00083564]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39227" "ADIPOGENESIS REGULATORY FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adipogenesis regulatory factor", "short" "ADIRF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 259, "taxa" 1529, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 791, "sets" 0, "proteins" 791, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 309}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034450", :literature {"PUB00083561" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Maeda K" "Okubo K" "Shimomura I" "Funahashi T" "Matsuzawa Y" "Matsubara K."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
