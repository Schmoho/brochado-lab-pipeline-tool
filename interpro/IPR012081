{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F (AhpF) is a homodimeric flavoenzyme which catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of the peroxiredoxin AhpC, which then reduces hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. AhpF contains an NTD containing two contiguous TRX-fold subdomains similar to Pyrococcus furiosus protein disulfide oxidoreductase (PfPDO). It also contains a catalytic core similar to TRX reductase containing FAD and NADH binding domains with an active site disulfide [[cite:PUB00015995]]. The NAD(P)H binding domain of AhpF may act to resolve the disulphide which forms after oxidation of the active site cysteine in AphC [[cite:PUB00042839]]. This protein contains two paired conserved cysteine motifs, CxxC and CxHCDGP.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4o5q", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Alkylhydroperoxide Reductase AhpF from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000238" "Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, subunit F"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03140" "alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F", "short" "Alkyl_hydroperoxide_Rdtase_suF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2005, "taxa" 8913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9437, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7237}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0676", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0676"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
