{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MreD (murein formation D) protein is involved in bacterial cell shape determination. Most rod-shaped bacteria depend on MreB and RodA to achieve either a rod shape or some other non-spherical morphology such as coil or stalk formation. MreD is encoded in an operon with MreB, and often with RodA and PBP-2 as well. It is highly hydrophobic (therefore somewhat low-complexity) and highly divergent, and therefore cannot always be identified on the basis of sequence similarity.</p>\r\n<p>This group represents predicted MreD proteins found primarily in Clostridium and Treponema species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037497" "Predicted cell shape-determining protein MreD, Clostridium/Treponema type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell shape-determining protein MreD, predicted", "short" "Cell_shape_determin_MreD_prd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 448, "taxa" 1520, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1452, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1152}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017225", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007227", "name" "Cell shape-determining protein MreD", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017225", "name" "Cell shape-determining protein MreD, predicted", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026034", "name" "Cell shape-determining protein MreD, proteobacterial type", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
