{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are the WecA enzymes of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis, undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphatetransferase ([ec:2.7.8.33]) [[cite:PUB00101155]]. This family represents one narrow clade, and closely related sequences outside this clade may represent enzymes that catalyse the same specific reaction, but in the context of different pathways. A His-rich motif in a cytosolic loop of this integral membrane protein, shown to be critical to enzymatic activity for WecA [[cite:PUB00017060]] is variously present or absent in the clade that includes Bacillus subtilis TagO teichoic acid biosynthesis enzyme, which may catalyse the same reaction as WecA. Aspartic acids residues have been shown to be important for catalytic activity and for binding a metal ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup>on Mn<sup>2+</sup>) [[cite:PUB00088369]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02380" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine--undecaprenyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase"}, "hamap" {"MF_02030" "Undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphate transferase [wecA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphatetransferase", "short" "ECA_WecA-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 337, "taxa" 2194, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2371, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1838}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1270", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1270"} {"accession" "GenProp0970", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0970"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
