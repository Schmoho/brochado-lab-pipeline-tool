{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are the large (alpha) subunit of the alpha-2/beta-2 tetrameric enzyme that reactivates B12-dependent trimeric diol dehydratases (1,2-propanediol dehydratase, glycerol dehydratase). Note that the beta subunit of the reactivase is homologous to the beta (medium) subunit of the diol dehydratase. The reactivase catalyzes the exchange of chemically inactivated B-12 for active B12. This entry excludes homologues from Mycobacterium (e.g. M. smegmatis), where the several paralogous forms of the dehydratase occur and are exceptional also by not being found in a carboxysome-like microcompartment [[cite:PUB00069745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2d0o", "name" "Structure of diol dehydratase-reactivating factor complexed with ADP and Mg2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028975", "name" "Diol dehydratase-reactivating factor, alpha subunit, swiveling domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04491" "diol dehydratase reactivase subunit alpha"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011502" "Diol/glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor, large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diol dehydratase-reactivating factor large subunit", "short" "DDRA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 1528, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1861, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1861, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1480}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1089", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1089"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009191", :literature {"PUB00069745" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Mori K" "Hosokawa Y" "Yoshinaga T" "Toraya T."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07898.x", "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Diol dehydratase-reactivating factor is a reactivase--evidence for multiple turnovers and subunit swapping with diol dehydratase.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "4931-43", "volume" "277", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21040475}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009191", "name" "Diol dehydratase-reactivating factor large subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
