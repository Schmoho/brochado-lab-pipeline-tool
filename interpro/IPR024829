{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Radiation-inducible immediate-early gene IEX-1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IER3 gene. The protein is involved in cell proliferation and survival, including the protection of cells from TNF-induced apoptosis [[cite:PUB00056635]]. It is rapidly induced by growth factors, viral infections or chemical carcinogens [[cite:PUB00056636]].</p>\n\n<p>IEX-1 has a dual role in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling. Upon phosphorylation by ERK, IEX-1 acquires the ability to inhibit cell death induced by various stimuli. In turn, by binding to active ERK, IEX-1 potentiates ERK activation in response to various growth factors [[cite:PUB00056641], [cite:PUB00056642]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02100" "Radiation-inducible immediate-early gene IEX-1"}, "panther" {"PTHR16915" "IMMEDIATE EARLY RESPONSE 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radiation-inducible immediate-early gene IEX-1", "short" "IEX-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 586, "taxa" 1999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1564, "sets" 0, "proteins" 785, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 576}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024829", :literature {"PUB00056635" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5379", "authors" ["Wu MX" "Ao Z" "Prasad KV" "Wu R" "Schlossman SF."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5379.998", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "IEX-1L, an apoptosis inhibitor involved in NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "998-1001", "volume" "281", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9703517}, "PUB00056636" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wu MX."], "ISO_journal" "Apoptosis", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021688600370", "medline_journal" "Apoptosis", "title" "Roles of the stress-induced gene IEX-1 in regulation of cell death and oncogenesis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "11-8", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12510147}, "PUB00056641" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Letourneux C" "Rocher G" "Porteu F."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600980", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "B56-containing PP2A dephosphorylate ERK and their activity is controlled by the early gene IEX-1 and ERK.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "727-38", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16456541}, "PUB00056642" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Garcia J" "Ye Y" "Arranz V" "Letourneux C" "Pezeron G" "Porteu F."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf488", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "IEX-1: a new ERK substrate involved in both ERK survival activity and ERK activation.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "5151-63", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12356731}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0043066", "name" "negative regulation of apoptotic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024829", "name" "Radiation-inducible immediate-early gene IEX-1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
