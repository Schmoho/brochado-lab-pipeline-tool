{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbonic anhydrases (CA: [ec:4.2.1.1]) are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyse the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate [[cite:PUB00044806], [cite:PUB00044807]]. The alpha-CAs are found predominantly in animals but also in bacteria and green algae. There are at least 15 isoforms found in mammals, which can be subdivided into cytosolic CAs (CA-I, CA-II, CA-III, CA-VII and CA XIII), mitochondrial CAs (CA-VA and CA-VB), secreted CAs (CA-VI), membrane-associated (CA-IV, CA-IX, CA-XII and CA-XIV) and those without CA activity, the CA-related proteins (CA-RP VIII, X and XI).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5hpj", "name" "Photobacterium profundum alpha-carbonic anhydrase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036398", "name" "Alpha carbonic anhydrase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18952" "CARBONIC ANHYDRASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbonic anhydrase, alpha-class", "short" "Carbonic_anhydrase_a-class"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1368, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3186, "taxa" 13591, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35612, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35612, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23898}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
