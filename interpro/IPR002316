{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proline-tRNA ligase (also known as Prolyl-tRNA synthetase) belongs to class IIa aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Prolyl-tRNA synthetase ([ec:6.1.1.15]) exists in two forms, which are loosely related. The first form is present in the majority of eubacteria species. The second one, present in some eubacteria, is essentially present in archaea and eukaryota. The enzyme from Escherichia coli contains all three of the conserved consensus motifs characteristic of class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [[cite:PUB00006366]]. The complex between Thermus thermophilus prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRSTT) and its cognate tRNA has been crystallized using two different isoacceptors of tRNA(Pro) [[cite:PUB00006573]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (also known as aminoacyl-tRNA ligases) catalyse the attachment of an amino acid to its cognate transfer RNA molecule in a highly specific two-step reaction [[cite:PUB00079872], [cite:PUB00079873]]. These proteins differ widely in size and oligomeric state, and have limited sequence homology [[cite:PUB00007191]]. The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II. Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contain a characteristic Rossman fold catalytic domain and are mostly monomeric [[cite:PUB00006477]]. Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases share an anti-parallel β-sheet fold flanked by α-helices [[cite:PUB00000386]], and are mostly dimeric or multimeric, containing at least three conserved regions [[cite:PUB00000723], [cite:PUB00005365], [cite:PUB00004391]]. However, tRNA binding involves an α-helical structure that is conserved between class I and class II synthetases. In reactions catalysed by the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the aminoacyl group is coupled to the 2'-hydroxyl of the tRNA, while, in class II reactions, the 3'-hydroxyl site is preferred. The synthetases specific for arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, and some lysine synthetases (non-eukaryotic group) belong to class I synthetases. The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, and some lysine synthetases (non-archaeal group), belong to class-II synthetases. Based on their mode of binding to the tRNA acceptor stem, both classes of tRNA synthetases have been subdivided into three subclasses, designated 1a, 1b, 1c and 2a, 2b, 2c [[cite:PUB00007363]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045864", "name" "Class II Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/Biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) and lipoyl protein ligase (LPL)", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01046" "TRNASYNTHPRO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proline-tRNA ligase, class IIa", "short" "Pro-tRNA-ligase_IIa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 100, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10554, "taxa" 42303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 192229, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48593, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36451}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
