{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of Serine/threonine-protein kinases, including Atg1 from yeasts, Unc-51 from C. elegans, Ulk1-3 from humans and ATG1a/b/c/t from Arabidopsis.</p>\n\n<p>Atg1 is required for vesicle formation in autophagy and the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway [[cite:PUB00066530]].</p>\n\n<p>Ulk1-3 are involved in autophagy in response to starvation [[cite:PUB00098424], [cite:PUB00098425]]. Ulk1 and Ulk2 regulate filopodia extension and branching of sensory axons. They are important for axon growth, playing an essential role in neurite extension of cerebellar granule cells [[cite:PUB00042782], [cite:PUB00034854]].</p>\n\n<p>Unc-51 is important for axonal elongation and axonal guidance [[cite:PUB00042769]]. It is required for either the maintenance of axons (membrane turnover) or for an unknown neuronal function. C elegans worms lacking Unc-51 exhibit various abnormalities in axonal elongation and axonal structures. Unc-51 could also help control cell size along with Bec-1, as mutations in their corresponding genes results in a reduction in small body size without affecting cell number [[cite:PUB00042770]]. Unc-51 is also a component of the Unc-51/Atg-13 complex that is probably recruited by lgg-1 to preautophagosomes and is required for autophagosome formation [[cite:PUB00098426]].</p>\n\n<p>In plants, the ATG1/13 complex is both a regulator and a target of autophagy [[cite:PUB00098423]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8p5i", "name" "Kinase domain of mutant human ULK1 in complex with compound XMD-17-51"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24348" "SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE UNC-51-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine/threonine-protein kinase Atg1-like", "short" "Atg1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3790, "taxa" 15280, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27871, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27871, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17439}, "pathways" 29}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
