{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as repressors of jasmonate (JA) signaling [[cite:PUB00090915]]. The ZIM domain recruits the co-repressors NINJA and TOPLESS to JAZ-bound transcription factors, and contains a highly conserved TIF[F/Y]XG motif that defines the larger family of TIFY proteins to which JAZs belong. This family consists of TIFY/JAZ proteins, and also includes JAZ13 (At3g22275), a non-TIFY JAZ protein that is a repressor of JA signaling [[cite:PUB00090916]]. Some of the members of the TIFY/JAZ family, such as TIFY8, are not involved in JA signaling. TIFY8 is found in protein complexes involved in regulation of dephosphorylation, deubiquitination and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification, suggesting an important role in nuclear signal transduction [[cite:PUB00090920]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33077" "PROTEIN TIFY 4A-RELATED-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TIFY/JAZ family", "short" "TIFY/JAZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1081, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7452, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4553}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040390", :literature {"PUB00090916" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Thireault C" "Shyu C" "Yoshida Y" "St Aubin B" "Campos ML" "Howe GA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.12841", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Repression of jasmonate signaling by a non-TIFY JAZ protein in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "669-79", "volume" "82", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25846245}, "PUB00090920" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cuellar Perez A" "Nagels Durand A" "Vanden Bossche R" "De Clercq R" "Persiau G" "Van Wees SC" "Pieterse CM" "Gevaert K" "De Jaeger G" "Goossens A" "Pauwels L."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0084891", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The non-JAZ TIFY protein TIFY8 from Arabidopsis thaliana is a transcriptional repressor.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e84891", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24416306}, "PUB00090915" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7154", "authors" ["Chini A" "Fonseca S" "Fernandez G" "Adie B" "Chico JM" "Lorenzo O" "Garcia-Casado G" "Lopez-Vidriero I" "Lozano FM" "Ponce MR" "Micol JL" "Solano R."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06006", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "The JAZ family of repressors is the missing link in jasmonate signalling.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "666-71", "volume" "448", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17637675}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040390", "name" "TIFY/JAZ family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
