{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes succinate-acetate/proton symporter SatP from E. coli (also known as YaaH). It mediates the uptake of acetate and succinate and this transport is energetically dependent on the proton motive force [[cite:PUB00078051], [cite:PUB00150976]]. Structural studies of SatP revealed that it forms an hexameric channel structure. It has six transmembrane helices (TM) surrounding the central channel pore in each protomer and three conserved hydrophobic residues, FLY, located in the middle of the TM for pore constriction. There are three conserved polar residues in the TM1 that faces to the periplasmic side, and are closely associated with acetate translocation activity [[cite:PUB00150976]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes MM_0903 from Methanosarcina mazei ([swissprot:Q8PYF9]), which is involved in aceticlastic methanogenesis [[cite:PUB00160067]] and other uncharacterised proteins from archaea and eukaryotes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ys3", "name" "1.8 angstrom crystal structure of Succinate-Acetate Permease from Citrobacter koseri"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30178" "INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN YAAH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Succinate-acetate/proton symporter SatP", "short" "SatP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1146, "taxa" 6202, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5651, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5651, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4493}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047623", :literature {"PUB00078051" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sa-Pessoa J" "Paiva S" "Ribas D" "Silva IJ" "Viegas SC" "Arraiano CM" "Casal M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
