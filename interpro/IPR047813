{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the cyanobacterial pilus motility taxis protein HmpF and its homologues, a protein that is part of the Hmp system. The chemotaxis-like Hmp system is essential for motility and the coordinated polar accumulation of PilA on cells in motile filaments, while the Ptx system controls positive phototaxis. A direct interaction between HmpF and the T4P system was found to activate pilus extension, thus the Hmp system facilitates coordinated polarity of HmpF to establish motility, and the Ptx system modulates HmpF localization to initiate reversals in response to changes in light intensity [[cite:PUB00105738]]. The Hmp chemotaxis-like system of the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme is capable of sensing light indirectly, possibly via alterations in proton motive force, and modulates direct interaction between HmpF, and Hfq, PilT1, and PilT2 to regulate the T4P motors [[cite:PUB00105739]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038350" "pilus motility taxis protein HmpF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pilus motility taxis protein HmpF", "short" "HmpF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 166, "taxa" 1006, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 378}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047813", :literature {"PUB00105738" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Cho YW" "Gonzales A" "Harwood TV" "Huynh J" "Hwang Y" "Park JS" "Trieu AQ" "Italia P" "Pallipuram VK" "Risser DD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Dynamic localization of HmpF regulates type IV pilus activity and directional motility in the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "252-265", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28779543}, "PUB00105739" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Harwood TV" "Zuniga EG" "Kweon H" "Risser DD."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "The cyanobacterial taxis protein HmpF regulates type IV pilus activity in response to light.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e2023988118", "volume" "118", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33723073}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047813", "name" "Pilus motility taxis protein HmpF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
