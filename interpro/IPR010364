{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial CreD or Cet inner membrane proteins. Dominant mutations of the cet gene of Escherichia coli result in tolerance to colicin E2 and increased amounts of an inner membrane protein with a Mr of 42,000. The cet gene is shown to be in the same operon as the phoM gene, which is required in a phoR background for expression of the structural gene for alkaline phosphatase, phoA. Although the Cet protein is not required for phoA expression, it has been suggested that the Cet protein has an enhancing effect on the transcription of phoA [[cite:PUB00012269]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30092" "INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN CRED"}, "pfam" {"PF06123" "Inner membrane protein CreD"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004548" "Inner membrane protein CreD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family, inner membrane CreD", "short" "Uncharacterised_IM_CreD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 1079, "taxa" 5804, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6630, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6572, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4986}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010364", :literature {"PUB00012269" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Drury LS" "Buxton RS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
