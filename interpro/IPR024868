Fj encodes a partially secreted transmembrane (TM) type II glyco- protein. In Drosophila, the gene is a downstream target of the Notch signalling pathway in leg-segmentation and planar-cell polarity processes during eye development. Conserved in vertebrates, the murine homologue, fjx1, is also a direct target of Notch signalling [[cite:PUB00060261]]. The gene is expressed in mouse brain, in the peripheral nervous system, in epithelial cells of multiple organs, and during limb development [[cite:PUB00060261]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protein product is processed and secreted as a presumptive ligand [[cite:PUB00060261]]. fjx1 binding sites have been identified at complementary locations, suggesting that fjx1 may function as a novel signalling molecule [[cite:PUB00060261]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02072" "Four-jointed box protein 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR13147" "FOUR-JOINTED BOX PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Four-jointed box protein 1/four-jointed protein", "short" "FJX1/FJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 556, "taxa" 2565, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 884, "sets" 0, "proteins" 868, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 526}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
