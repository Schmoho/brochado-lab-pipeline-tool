{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The sequences in this family are similar to the reoviral minor core protein lambda 3 ([swissprot:P17378]), which functions as a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the protein capsid. It is organised into 3 domains. The N- and C-terminal domains create a \"cage\" which encloses a conserved central catalytic domain within a hollow centre. This catalytic domain is arranged to form finger, palm and thumb subdomains. Unlike other RNA polymerases, such as HIV reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase, the lambda 3 protein binds template and substrate with only localised rearrangements, and catalytic activity can occur with little structural change. However, the structure of the catalytic complex is similar to that of other polymerase catalytic complexes with known structure [[cite:PUB00016487]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043502", "name" "DNA/RNA polymerase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07925" "Reovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lambda 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Reovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lambda 3", "short" "RdRP_5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 104, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 528, "sets" 0, "proteins" 528, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
