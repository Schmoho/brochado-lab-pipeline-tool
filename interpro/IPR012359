{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are distantly related to MazG-type NTP pyrophosphohydrolase ([interpro:IPR011551]). Conserved residues of the MazG domain (at least three of the Glu residues, Asp, Lys and Arg), including those shown to be functionally important [[cite:PUB00013554]], are also conserved here. MazG protein of Thermotoga maritima has been shown to have both nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase and pyrophosphatase activities, while Escherichia coli MazG has only NTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity [[cite:PUB00013554], [cite:PUB00014610]]. Therefore, members of this group are tentatively predicted to be pyrophosphohydrolases.</p>\n\n<p>This family includes the putative pyrophosphatase YpjD from Bacillus subtilis. Although its biological role has not been described in detail, YpjD shows significant sequence similarity to the dimeric 2-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTP pyrophosphatase or dUTPase) and NTP-PPase MazG proteins. However, unlike typical tandem-domain MazG proteins, BsYpjD contains a single MazG-like domain [[cite:PUB00079704]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11531" "Nucleoside Triphosphate Pyrophosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.8) MazG-like domain putative pyrophosphatase YpjD from Bacillus subtilis and its bacterial homologs"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029904" "Predicted pyrophosphohydrolase, MazG-related, YpjD type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NTP pyrophosphohydrolase MazG-related, YpjD", "short" "MazG-related_YpjD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1770, "taxa" 6292, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6478, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6477, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5025}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012359", :literature {"PUB00013554" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Zhang J" "Zhang Y" "Inouye M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
