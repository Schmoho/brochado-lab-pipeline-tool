{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents polyisoprenyl-teichoic acid--peptidoglycan teichoic acid transferase TagU. TagU was previously known as bacterial transcriptional regulator LytR, and was originally described a 35kDa protein which is responsible for attenuation of expression of both itself and the lytABC operon. LytABC form an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, which is one of the two major autolysins of B. subtilis [[cite:PUB00021031]]. This protein has since been proposed to catalyse the transfer of the anionic cell wall polymers (APs) from their lipid-linked precursor to the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) within cell wall teichoic acid biosynthesis, hence the new name of polyisoprenyl-teichoic acid--peptidoglycan teichoic acid transferase TagU [[cite:PUB00057107]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01140" "Polyisoprenyl-teichoic acid--peptidoglycan teichoic acid transferase TagU [tagU]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyisoprenyl-teichoic acid--peptidoglycan teichoic acid transferase TagU", "short" "TagU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 202, "taxa" 722, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 887, "sets" 0, "proteins" 887, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 579}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
