{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the cell cycle link protein Clink from  Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) [[cite:PUB00099063]], which was identified as a suppressor of RNA silencing. It interacts with retinoblastoma-related proteins (pRB) and S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1). Clink contains LxCxE and F-box motifs that mediate the interactions with the respective proteins and the capacity of Clink to bind pRB correlates with its ability to stimulate viral replication. pRB is a key cell cycle regulator, which represses onset and progression into S-phase by interacting with a wide range of cell cycle-related proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19411" "Cell cycle link protein Clink"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell cycle link protein Clink", "short" "Clink"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 14, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 180, "sets" 0, "proteins" 180, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045832", :literature {"PUB00099063" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Amin I" "Ilyas M" "Qazi J" "Bashir R" "Yadav JS" "Mansoor S" "Fauquet CM" "Briddon RW."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Genes", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virus Genes", "title" "Identification of a major pathogenicity determinant and suppressors of RNA silencing encoded by a South Pacific isolate of Banana bunchy top virus originating from Pakistan.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "272-81", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21161359}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045832", "name" "Cell cycle link protein Clink", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 3}}}
