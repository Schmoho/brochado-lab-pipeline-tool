{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AddAB, also called RexAB, substitutes for RecBCD in several bacterial lineages. These DNA recombination proteins act before synapse and are particularly important for DNA repair of double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. The term AddAB is used broadly, with AddA homologues between the firmicutes and the alphaproteobacteria, while the partner AddB proteins show no strong homology across the two groups of species.</p>\n\n<p>The AddA/AddB heterodimer acts as both an ATP-dependent DNA helicase and an ATP-dependent, dual-direction single-stranded exonuclease. It recognises the chi site generating a DNA molecule suitable for the initiation of homologous recombination.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the ATP-dependent helicase/nuclease subunit A (AddA) which is required for chi fragment generation; this subunit has the helicase and 3' -> 5' nuclease activities [[cite:PUB00034450]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02785" "helicase-exonuclease AddAB subunit AddA"}, "hamap" {"MF_01451" "ATP-dependent helicase/nuclease subunit A [addA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent helicase/nuclease subunit A", "short" "AddA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1429, "taxa" 5079, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5755, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5755, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3650}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0493", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0493"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
