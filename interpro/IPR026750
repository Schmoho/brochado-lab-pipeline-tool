{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein N-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase (NTAN1) acts on the side-chain deamidation of N-terminal asparagine residues to aspartate. It is required for the ubiquitin-dependent turnover of intracellular proteins that initiate with Met-Asn. These proteins are acetylated on the retained initiator methionine and can subsequently be modified by the removal of N-acetyl methionine by acylaminoacid hydrolase (AAH). Conversion of the resulting N-terminal asparagine to aspartate by PNAD renders the protein susceptible to arginylation, polyubiquitination and degradation as specified by the N-end rule. NTAN1 does not act on substrates with internal or C-terminal asparagines and does not act on glutamine residues in any position [[cite:PUB00061751], [cite:PUB00061752]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6a0e", "name" "Crystal structure of human protein N-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase (NTAN1)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14736" "Protein N-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase"}, "panther" {"PTHR12498" "N-TERMINAL ASPARAGINE AMIDOHYDROLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein N-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase", "short" "NTAN1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 47, "proteomes" 1197, "taxa" 4901, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2657, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2509, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1636}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
