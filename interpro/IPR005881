{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The biosynthesis of L-cysteine is the predominant way by which inorganic sulphur is incorporated into organic compounds. In this process, the most abundant utilizable source of sulphur, inorganic sulphate, is taken up and reduced to sulphide. Sulphide is used to produce L-cysteine, which serves for protein synthesis or the production of other sulphur-containing organic compounds. Two routes for cysteine biosynthesis in nature have been documented.  Serine transacetylase (also known as serine O-acetyltransferase; [ec:2.3.1.30]) catalyzes steps in pathway I, the activation of L-serine by acetyl-coenzyme A, yielding O-acetyl-L-serine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4hzd", "name" "Crystal structure of Serine acetyltransferase in complex with Coenzyme A from Brucella abortus strain S19"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011004", "name" "Trimeric LpxA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000441" "Serine acetyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01172" "serine O-acetyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine O-acetyltransferase", "short" "Ser_O-AcTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6405, "taxa" 25987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34480, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31579, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24112}, "pathways" 223}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1301", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1301"} {"accession" "GenProp0218", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0218"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
