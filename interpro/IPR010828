{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes alcohol O-acetyltransferase 2 (Atf2), PSTB2-interacting protein 1 (PBI1) and N-acetyltransferase Sli1 from budding yeasts. Atf2 catalyses the esterification of isoamyl alcohol by acetyl coenzyme A [[cite:PUB00013060]]. PBI1 is a phosphatidic acid-binding protein involved in interorganelle phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) transport [[cite:PUB00158911]]. Sli1 confers resistance to the sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor drug myriocin (ISP-1). It inactivates ISP-1 by converting it into N-acetyl-myriocin [[cite:PUB00078890]].
