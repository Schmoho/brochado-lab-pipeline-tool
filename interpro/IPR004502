{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins includes thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, protein-disulphide isomerases, amongst others, some of which have several such domains. The sequence of proteins in this group at the redox-active disulphide site, CPYC, matches glutaredoxins rather than thioredoxins, although overall the sequence seems closer to thioredoxins.
