{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of zinc phosphodiesterases including zinc phosphodiesterase ELAC protein 2 (RNZ2/ELAC2, also known as ElaC homologue protein 2 and tRNase Z 2) from human and its homologues. RNZ2 has mitochondrial tRNA 3'-processing endonuclease activity. It is involved in tRNA maturation, by removing a 3'-trailer from precursor tRNA, playing an essential role in the production of mature tRNAs [[cite:PUB00102035], [cite:PUB00102037], [cite:PUB00102038]]. The homologue from Drosophila has some tRNA 3'-processing endonuclease activity of nuclear and mitochondrial pre-tRNA. It may participate in tRNA processing in the developing embryo [[cite:PUB00102036]]. Mutations in this protein have been associated with severe form of infantile cardiomyopathy [[cite:PUB00102037]] and and prostate cancer [[cite:PUB00102038]]. The homologue from C. elegans HOE-1 has been shown to compromise fertility [[cite:PUB00102038], [cite:PUB00102039]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12553" "ZINC PHOSPHODIESTERASE ELAC PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc phosphodiesterase ELAC protein 2-like", "short" "RNZ2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2551, "taxa" 8969, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5995, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5995, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3613}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
