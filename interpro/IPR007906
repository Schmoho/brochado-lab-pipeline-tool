{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the lactophorin precursors proteose peptone component 3 (PP3) and glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1). GlyCAM-1 functions as a ligand for L-selectin, a saccharide-binding protein on the surface of circulating leukocytes, and mediates the trafficking of blood-born lymphocytes into secondary lymph nodes. In this context, sulphatation of the carbohydrates of GlyCAM-1 has been shown to be a critical structural requirement to be recognised by L-selectin. GlyCAM-1 is also expressed in pregnant and lactating mammary glands of mouse and in an unknown site in the lung, in the bovine uterus and rat cochlea [[cite:PUB00010439]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05242" "Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1", "short" "GLYCAM-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 59, "taxa" 252, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 69}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007906", :literature {"PUB00010439" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Rasmussen LK" "Johnsen LB" "Petersen TE" "Sorensen ES."], "ISO_journal" "Immunol.
