{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of 3xHMG-box proteins (containing three copies of the HMG-box domain and a unique basic N-terminal domain), including 3xHMG-box1 (AT4G11080, also known as HMGB13) and 3xHMG-box2 (AT4G23800, also known as HMGB6) from Arabidopsis. Their three HMG-box domains and the basic N-terminal domain contribute to DNA binding [[cite:PUB00096520]]. Their expression is induced in late G2 phase of the cell cycle, and upon nuclear envelope breakdown in prophase they rapidly associate with the chromosomes. Shortly after mitosis they are degraded and an N-terminal destruction-box mediates the proteolysis. They may play a role in the organisation of plant mitotic chromosomes [[cite:PUB00096519]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46912" "HIGH MOBILITY GROUP B PROTEIN 13"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3xHMG-box protein HMGB6/HMGB13", "short" "HMGB6/HMGB13"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 397}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044601", :literature {"PUB00096519" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Antosch M" "Schubert V" "Holzinger P" "Houben A" "Grasser KD."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "Mitotic lifecycle of chromosomal 3xHMG-box proteins and the role of their N-terminal domain in the association with rDNA loci and proteolysis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1067-77", "volume" "208", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26213803}, "PUB00096520" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Pedersen DS" "Coppens F" "Ma L" "Antosch M" "Marktl B" "Merkle T" "Beemster GT" "Houben A" "Grasser KD."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "The plant-specific family of DNA-binding proteins containing three HMG-box domains interacts with mitotic and meiotic chromosomes.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "577-89", "volume" "192", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21781122}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044601", "name" "3xHMG-box protein HMGB6/HMGB13", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
