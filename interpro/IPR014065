{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzyme tRNA adenylyltransferase, also called tRNA-nucleotidyltransferase and CCA-adding enzyme, can add or repair the required CCA triplet at the 3 -end of tRNA molecules. Genes encoding tRNA include the CCA tail in some but not all bacteria, and this enzyme may be required for viability. Members of this family represent a distinct clade within the larger family [interpro:IPR002646] (tRNA nucleotidyltransferase/poly(A) polymerase family protein). The example from Streptomyces coelicolor was shown to act as a CCA-adding enzyme and not as a poly(A) polymerase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02692" "CCA tRNA nucleotidyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA adenylyltransferase", "short" "tRNA_adenylyltransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1884, "taxa" 5359, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5559, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5559, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4348}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014065", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014065", "name" "tRNA adenylyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
