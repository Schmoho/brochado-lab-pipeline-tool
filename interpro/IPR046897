{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Middle Components (MCs) of the ABC-3C biological conflict systems occupy the central position between the catalytic effector and ABC ATPases of the systems. MCs are defined by distinctive patterns of conserved charged residues. As some MCs are HTH domains, they are predicted to function akin to kleisins as DNA-binding partners for the ABC ATPases, assisting in recognition and responding to invasive elements such as DNA viruses. MC6 is a MC unifiable with the HTH fold [[cite:PUB00101219]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20293" "ABC-three component (ABC-3C) system Middle Component 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC-three component system, Middle Component 6", "short" "ABC-3C_MC6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 227, "taxa" 1961, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 966, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 770}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046897", :literature {"PUB00101219" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Krishnan A" "Burroughs AM" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Comprehensive classification of ABC ATPases and their functional radiation in nucleoprotein dynamics and biological conflict systems.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "10045-10075", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32894288}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046897", "name" "ABC-three component system, Middle Component 6", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 19, "alignment:full" 231}}}
