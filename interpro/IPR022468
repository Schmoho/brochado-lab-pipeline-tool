{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This clade of sequences are the closest homologues to the PhnX enzyme, phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald) hydrolase (phosphonatase, [ncbifam:TIGR01422]). This phosphonatase-like enzyme and PhnX itself are members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily having a a number of distinctive features that set them apart from typical HAD enzymes. The typical HAD N-terminal motif DxDx(T/V) here is DxAGT and the usual conserved lysine prior to the C-terminal motif is instead an arginine. Also distinctive of phosphonatase, and particular to its bi-catalytic mechanism is a conserved lysine in the variable \"cap\" domain [[cite:PUB00042854]]. This lysine forms a Schiff base with the aldehyde of phosphonoacetaldehyde, providing, through the resulting positive charge, a polarization of the C-P bond necesary for cleavage as well as a route to the initial product of cleavage, an ene-amine. The conservation of these elements in this phosphonatase-like enzyme suggests that the substrate is also, like Pald, a 2-oxo-ethylphosphonate. Despite this, the genomic context of members of this family are quite distinct from PhnX, which is almost invariably associated with the 2-aminoethylphosphonate transaminase PhnW ([ncbifam:TIGR02326]), the source of the substrate Pald. Members of this clade are never associated with PhnW, but rather associate with families of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases related to deaminating amino acid oxidases ([pfam:PF01266]) as well as zinc-dependent dehydrogenases ([pfam:PF00107]). Notably, family members from Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 and Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 are adjacent to the PhnCDE ABC cassette phosphonates transporter ([genprop:GenProp0236]) typically found in association with the phosphonates C-P lyase system ([genprop:GenProp0232]). These observations suggest two possibilities. First, the substrate for this enzyme family is also Pald, the non-association with PhnW not withstanding. Alternatively, the substrate is something very closely related such as hydroxyphosphonoacetaldehyde (Hpald). Hpald could come from oxidative deamination of 1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonate (HAEP) by the associated oxidase. HAEP would not be a substrate for PhnW due to its high specificity for AEP. HAEP has been shown to be a constituent of the sphingophosphonolipid of Bacteriovorax stolpii [[cite:PUB00042855]], and presumably has other natural sources. If Hpald is the substrate, the product would be glycoaldehyde (hydroxyacetaldehyde), and the associated alcohol dehydrogenase may serve to convert this to glycol.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03351" "phosphonatase-like hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonatase-like hydrolase", "short" "PhnX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 519, "taxa" 1967, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1603, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1242}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0736", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0736"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022468", :literature {"PUB00042854" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lahiri SD" "Zhang G" "Dunaway-Mariano D" "Allen KN."], "ISO_journal" "Bioorg.
