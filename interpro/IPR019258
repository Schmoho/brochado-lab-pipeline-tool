{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Mediator complex is a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. On recruitment the Mediator complex unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNA polymerase II, specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mediator complex is composed of at least 31 subunits: MED1, MED4, MED6, MED7, MED8, MED9, MED10, MED11, MED12, MED13, MED13L, MED14, MED15, MED16, MED17, MED18, MED19, MED20, MED21, MED22, MED23, MED24, MED25, MED26, MED27, MED29, MED30, MED31, CCNC, CDK8 and CDC2L6/CDK11.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Members of this family represent the Med4 subunit of the Mediator (Med) complex [[cite:PUB00044530], [cite:PUB00044531]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10018" "Vitamin-D-receptor interacting Mediator subunit 4"}, "panther" {"PTHR13208" "MEDIATOR OF RNA POLYMERASE II TRANSCRIPTION SUBUNIT 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mediator complex, subunit Med4", "short" "Mediator_Med4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 2433, "taxa" 8171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3886, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3865, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2514}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019258", :literature {"PUB00044530" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6730", "authors" ["Rachez C" "Lemon BD" "Suldan Z" "Bromleigh V" "Gamble M" "Naar AM" "Erdjument-Bromage H" "Tempst P" "Freedman LP."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/19783", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Ligand-dependent transcription activation by nuclear receptors requires the DRIP complex.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "824-8", "volume" "398", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10235266}, "PUB00044531" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6730", "authors" ["Naar AM" "Beaurang PA" "Zhou S" "Abraham S" "Solomon W" "Tjian R."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/19789", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Composite co-activator ARC mediates chromatin-directed transcriptional activation.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "828-32", "volume" "398", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10235267}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003712", "name" "transcription coregulator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006357", "name" "regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016592", "name" "mediator complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019258", "name" "Mediator complex, subunit Med4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 14, "alignment:full" 2221}}}
