{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Kinesin is a microtubule-associated force-producing molecular motor protein that transports numerous organelles along mirotubules. Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composed of two heavy chains and two identical light chains. The light chain has been proposed to function in the coupling of cargo to the heavy chain or in the modulation of its ATPase activity. The specificity of kinesin-cargo binding is thought to depend on the type of light chain that a kinesin molecule contains, where different isoforms of kinesin light chains are associated with different types of cargo, mitochondria and membranes of the Golgi complex [[cite:PUB00015444], [cite:PUB00094625]].</p>\n<p>The structure of Drosophila kinesin light chain was shown to have a core composed of a coiled-coil domain followed by five imperfect tandem repeats and a sixth shorter motif [[cite:PUB00002785]]. These repeats are highly conserved across species. The N and C termini are more variable and alternative splicing is responsible for the production of isoforms that differ in those two regions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011990", "name" "Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45783" "KINESIN LIGHT CHAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kinesin light chain", "short" "Kinesin_light"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1836, "taxa" 8584, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14589, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14589, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9141}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002151", :literature {"PUB00015444" {"URL" nil, "issue" "42", "authors" ["Gyoeva FK" "Sarkisov DV" "Khodjakov AL" "Minin AA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "The tetrameric molecule of conventional kinesin contains identical light chains.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "13525-31", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15491159}, "PUB00002785" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Gauger AK" "Goldstein LS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
