{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of proteins found in Eggerthellaceae, which includes the phosphoribosyl 1,2-cyclic phosphate 1,2-diphosphodiesterase (PhnPP) from Eggerthella lenta.

This intermediate is then hydrolyzed to ribose-5-phosphate and inorganic phosphate [[cite:PUB00135295]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016195", "name" "Polymerase/histidinol phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041661" "phosphoribosyl 1,2-cyclic phosphate 1,2-diphosphodiesterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoribosyl 1,2-cyclic phosphate 1,2-diphosphodiesterase", "short" "Cycl_ph_dihydrol"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 30, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
