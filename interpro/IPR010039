{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a small family of highly conserved proteins (>60% identity).  Two of these, BcbF and EcbF of Pasteurella multocida are believed to be part of the capsule polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery because they are co-transcribed from a locus devoted to that purpose [[cite:PUB00013832]]. In P. multocida there are six different variant capsules (A-F), and these proteins are found only in B and E. The other two species in which this gene is (currently) found are both also pathogenic. These proteins are also members of the IIIC subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.  All of the characterised enzymes within subfamily III are phosphatases, and all of the active site residues characteristic of HAD-superfamily phosphatases [[cite:PUB00003337]] are present in this subfamily.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01689" "capsule biosynthesis phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Capsule biosynthesis phosphatase", "short" "EcbF_BcbF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 69, "taxa" 562, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 332, "sets" 0, "proteins" 332, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 270}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010039", :literature {"PUB00013832" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Boyce JD" "Chung JY" "Adler B."], "ISO_journal" "Vet.
