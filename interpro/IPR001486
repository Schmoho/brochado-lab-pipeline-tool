{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of haemoglobin-like proteins found in eubacteria, cyanobacteria, protozoa, algae and plants, but not in animals or yeast. These proteins have a truncated 2-over-2 rather than the canonical 3-over-3 Î±-helical sandwich fold [[cite:PUB00035871]]. They include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>HbN (or GlbN): a truncated haemoglobin-like protein that binds oxygen cooperatively with a very high affinity and a slow dissociation rate, which may exclude it from oxygen transport. It appears to be involved in bacterial nitric oxide detoxification and in nitrosative stress [[cite:PUB00035878]].</li>\r\n<li>Cyanoglobin (or GlbN): a truncated haemoprotein found in cyanobacteria that has high oxygen affinity, and which appears to serve as part of a terminal oxidase, rather than as a respiratory pigment [[cite:PUB00035880]].</li>\r\n<li>HbO (or GlbO): a truncated haemoglobin-like protein with a lower oxygen affinity than HbN. HbO associates with the bacterial cell membrane, where it significantly increases oxygen uptake over membranes lacking this protein. HbO appears to interact with a terminal oxidase, and could participate in an oxygen/electron-transfer process that facilitates oxygen transfer during aerobic metabolism [[cite:PUB00035879]].</li>\r\n<li>Glb3: a nuclear-encoded truncated haemoglobin from plants that appears more closely related to HbO than HbN. Glb3 from Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) exhibits an unusual concentration-independent binding of oxygen and carbon dioxide [[cite:PUB00035881]].</li>\r\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The truncated haemoglobin (trHb) family branches into three main groups, designated as type I, II and III and named as HbN, HbO and HbP, respectively.
