{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Spider toxins of the CSTX family are ion channel toxins containing an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) structural motif or Knottin scaffold. The four disulphide bonds present in the CSTX spider toxin family are arranged in the following pattern: 1-4, 2-5, 3-8 and 6-7. CSTX-1 is the most important component of Cupiennius salei (Wandering spider) venom in terms of relative abundance and toxicity and therefore is likely to contribute significantly to the overall toxicity of the whole venom. CSTX-1 blocked rat neuronal L-type, but no other types of HVA Cav channels [[cite:PUB00044520]]. Interestingly, the omega-toxins from Phoneutria nigriventer (Brazilian armed spider) venom (another South American species also belonging to the Ctenidae family) are included as they carry the same disulphide bond arrangement. CSTX-1 has calcium channel blocking activity and exhibits cytolytic activity by affecting the outer leaflet curvature and/or pore formation across the membrane [[cite:PUB00044520], [cite:PUB00097257], [cite:PUB00097256]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10530" "Toxin with inhibitor cystine knot ICK or Knottin scaffold"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spider toxin CSTX, Knottin scaffold", "short" "Spider_toxin_CSTX_knottin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 96, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 489, "sets" 0, "proteins" 468, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 425}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019553", :literature {"PUB00044520" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Kubista H" "Mafra RA" "Chong Y" "Nicholson GM" "Beirao PS" "Cruz JS" "Boehm S" "Nentwig W" "Kuhn-Nentwig L."], "ISO_journal" "Neuropharmacology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2007.03.012", "medline_journal" "Neuropharmacology", "title" "CSTX-1, a toxin from the venom of the hunting spider Cupiennius salei, is a selective blocker of L-type calcium channels in mammalian neurons.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1650-62", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17517422}, "PUB00085657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "42", "authors" ["Vassilevski AA" "Fedorova IM" "Maleeva EE" "Korolkova YV" "Efimova SS" "Samsonova OV" "Schagina LV" "Feofanov AV" "Magazanik LG" "Grishin EV."], "ISO_journal" "J.
