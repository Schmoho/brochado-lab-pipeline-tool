{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dioxygenases catalyse the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into substrates. Cleavage of aromatic rings is one of the most important function of dioxygenases. The substrates of ring-cleavage dioxygenases can be classified into two groups according to the mode of scission of the aromatic ring. Intradiol enzymes cleave the aromatic ring between two hydroxyl groups, whereas extradiol enzymes cleave the aromatic ring between a hydroxylated carbon and another adjacent non-hydroxylated carbon. Extradiol dioxygenases are usually homomultimeric, bind one atom of ferrous ion per subunit and have a subunit size of about 33kDa. It has been shown [[cite:PUB00002507], [cite:PUB00002892]] that the known extradiol dioxygenases are evolutionary related. The conserved glutamate has been shown [[cite:PUB00005214]], in bphC, to be implicated in the binding of the ferrous iron atom.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase (HPCD) is an extradiol dioxygenase that catalyzes the oxygen-dependent extradiol cleavage of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (also known as homoprotocatechuate, HPCA) to produce 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde.
