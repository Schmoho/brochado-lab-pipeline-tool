{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry identifies the reductase component (HpaC) of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase [[cite:PUB00007219]].  This enzyme catalyses the first step (hydroxylation at the 3-position) in the degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate to succinate and pyruvate. 4-hydroxyphenylacetate arises from the degradation of tyrosine. These reductases catalyse the reduction of free flavins by NADPH.  The flavin is then utilised by the large subunit of the monooxygenase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012349", "name" "FMN-binding split barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02296" "4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase, reductase component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase, reductase component", "short" "HPA_mOase_red"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 138, "taxa" 1261, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1370, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1370, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1084}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0231", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0231"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
