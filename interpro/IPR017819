{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RepABC plasmids are generally very low copy-number and therefore depend on an efficient system of plasmid partitioning to enure their stability and replication [[cite:PUB00043441]]. The partioning system in these plasmids involves two proteins, RepA and RepB, and centromere-like sequences known as parS. Mutations in RepA, RepB or parS can dramatically lower plasmid stability and affect plasmid incompatibility. RepB is related to the plasmid partitoning protein ParB and is thought to function in a similar way by binding to segregation filaments formed by RepA and also to parS sites, thus recruiting the plasmid to the segregation machinery.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03454" "plasmid partitioning protein RepB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasmid partitioning protein, RepB", "short" "Plasmid_partition_RepB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 496, "taxa" 1782, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3492, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3492, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2869}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0487", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0487"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017819", :literature {"PUB00043441" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cevallos MA" "Cervantes-Rivera R" "Gutierrez-Rios RM."], "ISO_journal" "Plasmid", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2008.03.001", "medline_journal" "Plasmid", "title" "The repABC plasmid family.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "19-37", "volume" "60", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18433868}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017819", "name" "Plasmid partitioning protein, RepB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
