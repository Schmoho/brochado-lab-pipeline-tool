{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rrp6 is a nuclear-specific catalytic component of the RNA exosome complex which has 3'->5' exoribonuclease activity and participates in a multitude of cellular RNA processing and degradation events [[cite:PUB00045433]].

In contrast to yeast and humans where Rrp6 is encoded by a single gene, plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and polar, have three homologues of Rrp6 [[cite:PUB00098026]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12124" "POLYMYOSITIS/SCLERODERMA AUTOANTIGEN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosome complex exonuclease Rrp6-like", "short" "Rrp6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2598, "taxa" 9020, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4201}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
