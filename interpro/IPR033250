{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes CEP proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, including CEP2/CEP5-10. They may serve as negative regulators that mediate environmental influences on plant development [[cite:PUB00078263]]. They are extracellular signalling peptides that may regulate primary root growth rate and systemic nitrogen (N)-demand signalling. They mediate up-regulation of genes involved in N uptake and assimilation pathways [[cite:PUB00078262]]. CEP5 represses plant growth rate, it regulates shoot gravitropic responses [[cite:PUB00088573]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33348" "PRECURSOR OF CEP5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-terminally encoded peptide", "short" "CEP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 191, "taxa" 732, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1364, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1364, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 810}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033250", :literature {"PUB00078262" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6207", "authors" ["Tabata R" "Sumida K" "Yoshii T" "Ohyama K" "Shinohara H" "Matsubayashi Y."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1257800", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Perception of root-derived peptides by shoot LRR-RKs mediates systemic N-demand signaling.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "343-6", "volume" "346", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25324386}, "PUB00078263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Delay C" "Imin N" "Djordjevic MA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
