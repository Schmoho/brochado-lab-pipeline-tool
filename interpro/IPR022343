{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signalling via activated 7-transmembrane (7TM) serpentine receptors is well known in a range of organisms, but evidence for the existence of this pathway in plants has been elusive. Over the years, however, evidence that G proteins are involved in signal transduction in plants has been accumulating, leading several researchers to seek plant 7TM receptors.</p>\n\n<p>The first tangible evidence for a plant 7TM receptor came through an analysis of the expresssed sequence tag database, dbEST. This revealed an Arabidopsis thaliana gene (GCR1) that encodes a protein with 7 predicted TM domains, and other features characteristic of known 7TM receptors [[cite:PUB00053651], [cite:PUB00053652]]. The amino acid sequence of GCR1, however, is unusual in that it shows similarity to receptors from three different 7TM families [[cite:PUB00053651], [cite:PUB00053652]], sharing greatest levels of similarity with the Dictyostelium cAMP receptors.</p>\n\n<p>It has been suggested that the cAMP receptors coordinate aggregation of individual cells into a multicellular organism, and regulate the expression of a large number of developmentally-regulated genes [[cite:PUB00005114], [cite:PUB00001912], [cite:PUB00001913]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02001" "GCR1-cAMP receptor family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GCR1-cAMP receptor", "short" "GCR1-cAMP_receptor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1241, "taxa" 4681, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13067, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3464, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2286}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022343", :literature {"PUB00053651" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Josefsson LG" "Rask L."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
