{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Coenzyme F420 has a limited phylogenetic distribution, including methanogenic archaea, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species, Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H and Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2. Partial phylogenetic profiling identifies protein subfamilies, within the larger family called luciferase-like monooxygenanases ([pfam:PF00296]), that appear only in F420-positive genomes and are likely to be F420-dependent. This entry describes a small family, closely related to other such families in the putative F420-binding region, exemplified by MSMEG_3544 in Mycobacterium smegmatis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03854" "TIGR03854 family LLM class F420-dependent oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F420-dependent oxidoreductase-predicted, MSMEG3544", "short" "F420_OxRdatse_MSMEG3544_pred"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 124, "taxa" 489, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 426, "sets" 0, "proteins" 426, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 357}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0002", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0002"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022402", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022402", "name" "F420-dependent oxidoreductase-predicted, MSMEG3544", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
