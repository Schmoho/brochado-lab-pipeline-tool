{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trm112 is required for tRNA methylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast)  and is found in complexes with 2 tRNA methylases (Trm9 and Trm11) also with putative methyltransferase Ydr140w [[cite:PUB00020491]]. Trm112 from S. cerevisiae (Ynr046w) is plurifunctional and a component of the eRF1 methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00041889]]. The crystal structure of Ynr046w has been determined to 1.7 A resolution. It comprises a zinc-binding domain built from both the N- and C-terminal sequences and an inserted domain, absent from bacterial and archaeal orthologs of the protein, composed of three Î±-helices [[cite:PUB00041889]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trm112 has also been described in archaea (UPF0434 protein from Haloferax volcanii). UPF0434 proteins are found both in bacteria and archaea, and the study of interacting partners from the H. volcanii member appears to indicate that Trm112 is a general partner for methyltransferases in all organisms [[cite:PUB00090823]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes mitochondrial protein preY, an uncharacterized protein from vertebrates.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6h2u", "name" "Crystal structure of human METTL5-TRMT112 complex, the 18S rRNA m6A1832 methyltransferase at 1.6A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03966" "Trm112p-like protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_01187" "UPF0434 protein YcaR [ycaR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trm112-like", "short" "Trm112-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 115, "proteomes" 7182, "taxa" 27719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27637, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20935}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1461", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1461"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
