{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of small hydrophobic holin proteins with one or more transmembrane domains. Holins are encoded within the genomes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as those of the bacteriophages of these organisms. Their primary function appears to be transport of murein hydrolases across the cytoplasmic membrane to the cell wall where these enzymes hydrolyse the cell wall polymer as a prelude to cell lysis. When chromosomally encoded, these enzymes are therefore autolysins. Holins may also facilitate leakage of electrolytes and nutrients from the cell cytoplasm, thereby promoting cell death. Some may catalyse export of nucleases. LydA and lydB are encoded on the dar operon.  The phenotype of a rapid lysis in the absence of active LydB suggests that this protein might be an antagonist of the holin LydA [[cite:PUB00076211]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16083" "LydA holin phage, holin superfamily III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LydA-like holin", "short" "LydA_holin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 236, "taxa" 1913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1731, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1731, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1178}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032126", :literature {"PUB00076211" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Schmidt C" "Velleman M" "Arber W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
