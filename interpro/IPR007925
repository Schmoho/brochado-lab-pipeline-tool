{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TraM is a plasmid encoded DNA-binding protein that is essential for conjugative transfer of F-like plasmids (e.g. F, R1, R100 and pED208) between bacterial cells. Bacterial conjugation, a form of horizontal gene transfer between cells, is an important contributor to bacterial genetic diversity, enabling virulence and antibiotics resistance factors to rapidly spread in medically important human pathogens.</p>\r\n<p>Mutation studies have shown that TraM is required for normal levels of transfer gene expression as well as for efficient site-specific single-stranded DNA cleavage at the origin of transfer (oriT). TraM tetramers bridge oriT to a key component of the conjugative pore, the coupling protein TraD. The N-terminal ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domain of TraM is able to cooperatively bind DNA in a staggered arrangement without interaction between tetramers. This allows the C-terminal TraM tetramerization domains to be free to make multiple interactions with TraD, thus driving plasmid recruitment to the conjugative pore [[cite:PUB00079457], [cite:PUB00010445], [cite:PUB00058835], [cite:PUB00051289]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4qpo", "name" "Mechanistic basis of plasmid-specific DNA binding of the F plasmid regulatory protein, TraM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042073", "name" "TraM, DNA-binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14804" "TraM mediates signalling between transferosome and relaxosome"}, "pfam" {"PF05261" "TraM protein, DNA-binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Relaxosome protein TraM", "short" "TRelaxosome_TraM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 420, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 783, "sets" 0, "proteins" 783, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 624}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007925", :literature {"PUB00079457" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wong JJ" "Lu J" "Glover JN."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
