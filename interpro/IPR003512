{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is represented by the Bacteriophage M13, G5P, DNA-binding protein. The characteristics of the protein distribution suggest prophage matches in addition to the phage matches.</p>\n\n<p>G5P is the bacteriophage helix-destabilising protein, or single-stranded DNA binding protein, required for DNA synthesis. The protein binds to DNA in a highly cooperative manner without pronounced sequence specificity. In the presence of single-stranded DNA it binds cooperatively to form a helical protein-DNA complex. It prevents the conversion during synthesis of the single-stranded (progeny) viral DNA back into the double-stranded replicative form.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gvp", "name" "GENE V PROTEIN (SINGLE-STRANDED DNA BINDING PROTEIN)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02303" "Helix-destabilising protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage M13, G5P, DNA-binding", "short" "Phage_M13_G5P_DNA-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 65, "taxa" 574, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 385, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 243}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003512", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003697", "name" "single-stranded DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006260", "name" "DNA replication", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003512", "name" "Bacteriophage M13, G5P, DNA-binding", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 70}}}
