{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DltA is part of the operon for incorporation of D-Ala residues into lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which requires the activity of four gene products (DltA to DltD). DltA is a cytoplasmic D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase that catalyses the D-alanylation of the D-alanyl carrier protein DltC (or Dcp); DltB is a transmembrane protein thought to be involved in the efflux of activated D-alanine to the site of acylation; and DltD is thought to be a membrane-associated protein that may have multifunctional activities (hydrolysis of mischarged DltC, facilitation of D-alanine ligation to DltC and D-alanylation of LTAs) [[cite:PUB00086797], [cite:PUB00086696]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4pzp", "name" "Substrate-free structure of D-alanine carrier protein ligase DltA from Bacillus cereus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00593" "D-alanine--D-alanyl carrier protein ligase [dltA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01734" "D-alanine--poly(phosphoribitol) ligase subunit DltA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-alanine--D-alanyl carrier protein ligase", "short" "DltA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 272, "taxa" 1659, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2050, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2050, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1504}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1398", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1398"} {"accession" "GenProp0958", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0958"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
