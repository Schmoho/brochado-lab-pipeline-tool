{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes spheroidene monooxygenase CrtA from Rhodobacter sphaeroides ([ec:1.14.15.9]) and similar sequences. CrtA catalyses the asymmetrical introduction of one keto group at the C-2 position of spheroidene and two keto groups at the C-2 and C-2' positions of spirilloxanthin in carotenoid pathways. Spectroscopic analysis suggests CrtA may have a 5-coordinated heme at its active site and that it may be a novel oxygenase and not a P450 enzyme [[cite:PUB00145347], [cite:PUB00147175], [cite:PUB00145351], [cite:PUB00147176]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21650" "spheroidene monooxygenase and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spheroidene monooxygenase CrtA-like", "short" "CrtA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 692, "taxa" 2450, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2221, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2221, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1713}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
