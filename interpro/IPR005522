{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Inositol phosphates (IPs) act as signalling messengers to regulate various cellular processes such as growth. This entry includes a group of inositol polyphosphate kinase, including inositol polyphosphate multikinase Arg82 and Inositol hexakisphosphate/inositol heptakisphosphate kinase Kcs1 from budding yeast. They play important roles in vacuole biogenesis and the cell's response to certain environmental stresses. The kinase activity of Arg82 and Kcs1 is required for the production of soluble inositol phosphates [[cite:PUB00087183]]. Independently of its catalytic activity, Arg82 is crucial for assembling the Arg80-Mcm1 protein complex at the promoter region of genes involved in arginine metabolism [[cite:PUB00087183]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes human inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1/2/3 (IP6K1/2/3)[[cite:PUB00087186]], inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) [[cite:PUB00087184]] and inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A/B/C (IP3KA/B/C) [[cite:PUB00087185]]. They are involved in inositol phosphate biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00087187]]. Independently of its catalytic activity, IPMK mediates the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in response to essential amino acids [[cite:PUB00087187]. Crystallographic analysis showed that the disordered domains of IPMK modulates its kinase activity [[cite:PUB00095238]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1w2f", "name" "Human Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate 3-kinase substituted with selenomethionine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038286", "name" "Inositol polyphosphate kinase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12400" "INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE KINASE"}, "pfam" {"PF03770" "Inositol polyphosphate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inositol polyphosphate kinase", "short" "IPK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 51, "domain_architectures" 181, "proteomes" 2700, "taxa" 9223, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15440, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15146, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9465}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1460", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1460"} {"accession" "GenProp1249", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1249"} {"accession" "GenProp1509", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1509"} {"accession" "GenProp1574", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1574"} {"accession" "GenProp1692", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1692"} {"accession" "GenProp1229", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1229"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
