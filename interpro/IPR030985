{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family have a novel N-terminal sequence region. The C-terminal region of these proteins share homology with proteins in the PpiC-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase entry ([interpro:IPR000297]). However, proteins in this family are not included in the IPR000297 entry, suggesting an origin within a branch of the PpiC family but subsequent neofunctionalisation with a rapid change of sequence. The genome context for members always includes an ATP-grasp enzyme associated with peptide modification and a short polypeptide likely to be the modification target.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04500" "TIGR04500 family putative peptide maturation system protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative peptide maturation system protein", "short" "PpiC-rel_mature"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 37, "taxa" 143, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 112, "sets" 0, "proteins" 112, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 73}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030985", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030985", "name" "Putative peptide maturation system protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
