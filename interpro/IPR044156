{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents members of a family of galactoside-binding lectins (galectins) with related amino acid sequences, sometimes referred to as S-type or S-Lac lectins. Members of this family are found in tissues of many animals, ranging from lower invertebrates such as sponges and nematodes to mammals, including humans [[cite:PUB00000902]]. This family also includes Galectin-related protein and Grifin, galectin relatives which lack of beta-galactosides binding activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Animal lectins are proteins that bind to sugars and are involved in most non-structural roles of sugars, including trafficking of glycoconjugates and cell-cell recognition. Although they may be structurally very complex, they typically bind through the activity of a specific compact protein domain known as a carbohydrate-binding domain or CRD [[cite:PUB00035053]]. Animal lectins display a wide variety of architectures, and are classified according to the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of which there are two main types, S-type and C-type.</p>\n\n<p>Galectins (previously S-lectins) bind exclusively beta-galactosides like lactose. They do not require metal ions for activity. Galectins are found predominantly, but not exclusively in mammals [[cite:PUB00000902]]. Their function is unclear. They are developmentally regulated and may be involved in differentiation, cellular regulation and tissue construction. Mammalian galectins typically bind beta-galactosides. Their CRD shows a structural similarity to L-type lectin CRDs, but no strong sequence similarity, suggesting convergent evolution [[cite:PUB00021763]]. They are classified into three subgroups: proto type, which contain one CRD (Gal-1, -2, -5, -7, -10, -11, -13, -14 and -15); tandem repeat type, which contain two CRDs in tandem (Gal-4, -6, -8, -9 and -12); and chimera type, which contain one CRD and an additional non-lectin domain (Gal-3) [[cite:PUB00073443], [cite:PUB00043740]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jj6", "name" "Crystal structure of the putative carbohydrate recognition domain of the human galectin-related protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11346" "GALECTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galectin-like", "short" "Galectin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 392, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1045, "taxa" 4529, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15464, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15464, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10105}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044156", :literature {"PUB00021763" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Lobsanov YD" "Gitt MA" "Leffler H" "Barondes SH" "Rini JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
