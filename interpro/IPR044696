{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the WPP domain-interacting protein (WIP) family which includes WIP1, 2 and 3 from Arabidopsis. These proteins are specific to plants and required for the localisation and anchorage of Ran GTPase-activating proteins (RanGAP) to the nuclear envelope (NE) mediated by WIT1 and WIT2 in undifferentiated cells of root tips [[cite:PUB00096857], [cite:PUB00090377]]. They are part of the SUN-WIP-WIT2-KAKU1 complex, in which they mediate the transfer of cytoplasmic forces to the nuclear envelope (NE), leading to nuclear shape changes [[cite:PUB00090379]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34562" "WPP DOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WPP domain-interacting protein 1/2/3", "short" "WIP1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 231, "taxa" 878, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 914, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 561}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044696", :literature {"PUB00090379" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhou X" "Groves NR" "Meier I."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleus", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1080/19491034.2014.1003512", "medline_journal" "Nucleus", "title" "Plant nuclear shape is independently determined by the SUN-WIP-WIT2-myosin XI-i complex and CRWN1.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "144-53", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25759303}, "PUB00096857" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Xu XM" "Meulia T" "Meier I."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Biol", "title" "Anchorage of plant RanGAP to the nuclear envelope involves novel nuclear-pore-associated proteins.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1157-63", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17600715}, "PUB00090377" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhao Q" "Brkljacic J" "Meier I."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.059220", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Two distinct interacting classes of nuclear envelope-associated coiled-coil proteins are required for the tissue-specific nuclear envelope targeting of Arabidopsis RanGAP.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1639-51", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18591351}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044696", "name" "WPP domain-interacting protein 1/2/3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
