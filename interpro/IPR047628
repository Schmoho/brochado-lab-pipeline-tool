{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of bacterial proteins, including L-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reductase from Escherichia coli (GAP reductase), which catalyses the stereospecific, NADPH-dependent reduction of L-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (L-GAP). Its physiological role is the detoxification of L-GAP, which may be formed by non-enzymatic racemisation of GAP. Also involved in the stress response as a methylglyoxal reductase which converts the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal to acetol in vitro and in vivo [[cite:PUB00059153], [cite:PUB00108085], [cite:PUB00059154]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n6q", "name" "Crystal structure of YghZ from E. coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036812", "name" "NADP-dependent oxidoreductase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd19150" "Escherichia coli L-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reductase (GPR/YghZ/AKR14A1) and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reductase", "short" "GAP_reductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 610, "taxa" 2827, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2667, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2667, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2109}, "pathways" 147}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
