This family is closely associated with a binding protein-dependent ABC transporter, suggesting a role in catabolism.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8k74", "name" "A novel monooxygenase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04027" "putative FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative luciferase-like monooxygenase, KPN01858", "short" "Luciferase-like_KPN01858"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 179, "taxa" 981, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 872, "sets" 0, "proteins" 872, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 644}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0935", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0935"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024003", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024003", "name" "Putative luciferase-like monooxygenase, KPN01858", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
