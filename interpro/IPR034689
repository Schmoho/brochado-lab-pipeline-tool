{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes endolysin, a bacteriophage T7 protein which has amidase activity and is able to degrade host peptidoglycans.  It is important for release of virus particles from the infected bacterial cell and acts together with holin and spanin to bring about cell lysis.  Endolysin hydrolyzes the link between N-acetylmuramoyl residues and L-amino acid residues in certain cell-wall glycopeptides [[cite:PUB00084186]]. Endolysin also inhibits the viral RNA polymerase and plays an important role in the switch between viral transcription and genome replication [[cite:PUB00084187]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036505", "name" "N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase/PGRP domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04111" "Endolysin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endolysin T7 type", "short" "Endolysin_T7_type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 98, "taxa" 646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 459, "sets" 0, "proteins" 459, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
