{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences comprise a paralogous family of proteins predominantly found in Brassicaceae. Length heterogeneity within the family is attributable partly to a 21-residue repeat present in from zero to three tandem copies. One member of the family, protein MS5, has been shown to be important for progression of meiosis during early prophase and is essential for pairing of homologues. It is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs [[cite:PUB00080256]]. The structure of MS5 revealed that it adopts a cystatin-like fold that consists of a central α-helix and four- or five-stranded antiparallel β-sheets that wrap around it [[cite:PUB00106857]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6l77", "name" "Crystal structure of MS5 from Brassica napus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31260" "CYSTATIN/MONELLIN SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF04776" "Protein MS5"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01572" "TIGR01572 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein MS5", "short" "MS5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 58, "proteomes" 80, "taxa" 351, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2237, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1360}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006462", :literature {"PUB00080256" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Xin Q" "Shen Y" "Li X" "Lu W" "Wang X" "Han X" "Dong F" "Wan L" "Yang G" "Hong D" "Cheng Z."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "MS5 mediates early meiotic progression and its natural variants may have applications for hybrid production in Brassica napus.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27194707}, "PUB00106857" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Wang X" "Gao Y" "Guan Z" "Xie Z" "Zhang D" "Yin P" "Yang G" "Hong D" "Xin Q."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Structural analysis of the meiosis-related protein MS5 reveals non-canonical papain enhancement by cystatin-like folds.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "2462-2471", "volume" "594", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32415887}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006462", "name" "Protein MS5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 51, "alignment:full" 637}}}
