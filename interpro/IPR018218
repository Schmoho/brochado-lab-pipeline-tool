{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Scorpion toxins, which may be mammal or insect specific, bind to sodium channels, inhibiting the inactivation of activated channels and blocking neuronal transmission. The complete covalent structure of the toxins has been deduced: it comprises around 66 amino acid residues and is cross-linked by four disulphide bridges [[cite:PUB00001584], [cite:PUB00005313]]. An anti-epilepsy peptide isolated from scorpion venom [[cite:PUB00000473]] shows similarity to both scorpion neurotoxins and anti-insect toxins.</p>\n\n<p>This entry contains alpha toxins as well as beta-insect depressant toxins, and other toxins. Alpha toxins are highly toxic both to mammals and insects [[cite:PUB00095081]]. Depressant insect beta-toxins cause a transient contraction paralysis followed by a slow flaccid paralysis. They bind voltage-independently at site-4 of sodium channels and block action potentials, primarily by depolarising the axonal membrane and suppressing the sodium current. This depressant toxin is active only on insects. It is found in a relatively small amount in the venom. Beta toxins from Centruroides tecomanus also bind voltage-independently at site-4 of sodium channels (Nav) and shift the voltage of activation toward more negative potentials thereby affecting sodium channel activation and promoting spontaneous and repetitive firing and are possibly lethal to mice, freshwater shrimp and crickets [[cite:PUB00097254]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2i61", "name" "Depressant anti-insect neurotoxin, LqhIT2 from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036574", "name" "Knottin, scorpion toxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00285" "SCORPNTOXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Scorpion long chain toxin", "short" "Scorpion_toxinL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 69, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 135, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2409, "sets" 0, "proteins" 611, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 534}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018218", :literature {"PUB00001584" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kopeyan C" "Mansuelle P" "Sampieri F" "Brando T" "Bahraoui EM" "Rochat H" "Granier C."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(90)80607-K", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Primary structure of scorpion anti-insect toxins isolated from the venom of Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "423-6", "volume" "261", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2311768}, "PUB00005313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gregoire J" "Rochat H."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0041-0101(83)90058-2", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Covalent structure of toxins I and II from the scorpion Buthus occitanus tunetanus.", "year" 1983, "raw_pages" "153-62", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6845379}, "PUB00000473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhou XH" "Yang D" "Zhang JH" "Liu CM" "Lei KJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
