{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains the cytochrome c biogenesis protein encoded by ccmA, part Ccm-System I found in bacteria, archaea and plant mitochondria. Bacterial c-type cytochromes are located on the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. Several gene products encoded in a locus designated as Cytochrome c maturation (Ccm)-System I are implicated in the transport and assembly of the functional cytochrome c. In some organisms this process involves up to nine (CcmABCDEFGHI) membrane proteins working together to achieve heme ligation. The post-translational pathway includes the transport of a heme b moiety, the translocation of the apocytochrome c and the covalent attachment of the heme with the apocytochrome c. CcmABCD are homologous to the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and are responsible for conveying heme b to the periplasm and loading it to the heme-chaperone CcmE [[cite:PUB00088326]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43499" "ABC TRANSPORTER I FAMILY MEMBER 1"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01189" "heme ABC exporter ATP-binding protein CcmA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, haem export, CcmA", "short" "ABC_transptr_haem_export_CcmA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3202, "taxa" 13275, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16850, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16848, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13170}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC51237", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC51237"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0678", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0678"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
