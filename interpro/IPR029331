{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Muscular LMNA-interacting protein (MLIP) is a muscle-enriched A-type Lamin-interacting protein, an innovation of amniotes, and is expressed ubiquitously and most abundantly in heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle. MLIP interacts directly and co-localises with lamin A and C in the nuclear envelope. MLIP also co-localises with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies within the nucleus. PML, like MLIP, is only found in amniotes, suggesting that a functional link between the nuclear envelope and PML bodies may exist through MLIP [[cite:PUB00070002]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15274" "Muscular LMNA-interacting protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR31514" "MUSCULAR LMNA-INTERACTING PROTEIN MLIP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Muscular LMNA-interacting protein", "short" "MLIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 566, "taxa" 1942, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2655, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1810, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1085}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029331", :literature {"PUB00070002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Ahmady E" "Deeke SA" "Rabaa S" "Kouri L" "Kenney L" "Stewart AF" "Burgon PG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
