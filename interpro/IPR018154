{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Enveloped viruses such as Human immunodeficiency virus 1, influenza virus, and Ebola virus sp. express a surface glycoprotein that mediates both cell attachment and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The ENV polyprotein (coat polyprotein) usually contains two coat proteins which differ depending on the source.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of a number of the ENV polyprotein domains have been determined:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The crystal structure of an extraviral segment of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) transmembrane (TM) subunit has been determined to 1.7-A resolution. This segment contains a trimeric coiled coil, with a hydrophobic cluster at its base and a strand that packs in an antiparallel orientation against the coiled coil. This structure serves as a model for a wide range of viral fusion proteins; key residues in this structure are conserved among C- and D-type retroviruses and the filovirus ebola [[cite:PUB00027393]].</li>\n<li>An essential step in retrovirus infection is the binding of the virus to its receptor on a target cell. The structure of the receptor-binding domain of the envelope glycoprotein from Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) has been determined determined to 2.0-A resolution. The core of the domain is an antiparallel β sandwich, with two interstrand loops forming a helical subdomain atop the sandwich. The residues in the helical region, but not in the β sandwich, are highly variable among mammalian C-type retroviruses with distinct tropisms, indicating that the helical subdomain determines the receptor specificity of the virus [[cite:PUB00010668]].</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4jf3", "name" "Crystal structure of the mpmv tm retroviral fusion core"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008981", "name" "F-MuLV receptor-binding", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10424" "VIRAL ENVELOPE PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF00429" "ENV polyprotein (coat polyprotein)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TLV/ENV coat polyprotein", "short" "TLV/ENV_coat_polyprotein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 210, "proteomes" 584, "taxa" 2548, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13710, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13188, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4742}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018154", :literature {"PUB00027393" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Fass D" "Harrison SC" "Kim PS."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
