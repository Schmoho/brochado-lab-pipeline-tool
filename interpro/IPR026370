{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase THC1 from a small number of eukaryotes, some of them anaerobic. The pathway can occur under anaerobic conditions, and the product is thought to replace sterols, letting organisms with this compound build membrane suitable for performing phagocytosis. It catalyses the oxygen-independent cyclization of squalene into tetrahymanol, a triterpenoid sterol with five cyclohexyl rings that is involved in membrane integrity, permeability and fluidity [[cite:PUB00100819]], [cite:PUB00106855]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04277" "tetrahymanol synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase THC1", "short" "Tetrahymanol_synth_THC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 52, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
