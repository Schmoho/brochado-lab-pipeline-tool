{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In eukaryotes, cyclin-dependent protein kinases interact with cyclins to regulate cell cycle progression, and are required for the G1 and G2 stages of cell division [[cite:PUB00001157]]. The proteins bind to a regulatory subunit, cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit (CKS), which is essential for their function. This regulatory subunit is a small protein of 79 to 150 residues. In yeast (gene CKS1) and in fission yeast (gene suc1) a single isoform is known, while mammals have two highly related isoforms. The regulatory subunits exist as hexamers, formed by the symmetrical assembly of 3 interlocked homodimers, creating an unusual 12-stranded Î²-barrel structure [[cite:PUB00005179]]. Through the barrel centre runs a 12A diameter tunnel, lined by 6 exposed helix pairs [[cite:PUB00001914]]. Six kinase units can be modelled to bind the hexameric structure, which may thus act as a hub for cyclin-dependent protein kinase multimerisation [[cite:PUB00001914], [cite:PUB00005179]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6gu2", "name" "CDK1/CyclinB/Cks2 in complex with Flavopiridol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036858", "name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase, regulatory subunit superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01084" "Cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit"}, "prosite" {"PS00945" "Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunits signature 2", "PS00944" "Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunits signature 1"}, "pfam" {"PF01111" "Cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit"}, "prints" {"PR00296" "CYCLINKINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase, regulatory subunit", "short" "Cyclin-dep_kinase_reg-sub"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 78, "proteomes" 2543, "taxa" 8661, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5762, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5754, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3894}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00728", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00728"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000789", :literature {"PUB00001157" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Brizuela L" "Draetta G" "Beach D."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=3322810", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "p13suc1 acts in the fission yeast cell division cycle as a component of the p34cdc2 protein kinase.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "3507-14", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3322810}, "PUB00005179" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5132", "authors" ["Parge HE" "Arvai AS" "Murtari DJ" "Reed SI" "Tainer JA."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/262/5132/387", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Human CksHs2 atomic structure: a role for its hexameric assembly in cell cycle control.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "387-95", "volume" "262", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8211159}, "PUB00001914" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Tang Y" "Reed SI."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/5/822", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "The Cdk-associated protein Cks1 functions both in G1 and G2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "822-32", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8491379}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016538", "name" "cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase regulator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000789", "name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase, regulatory subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 87, "alignment:full" 3574}}}
