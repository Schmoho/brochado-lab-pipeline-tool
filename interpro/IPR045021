{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the plant-specific proteins PSI 1-3 (Protein PSK SIMULATOR 1-3) from Arabidopsis. These proteins promote plant growth, especially at the vegetative stage, probably via the regulation of phytosulfokine (PSK) signalling; PSKs are peptide phytohormones acting as growth factors [[cite:PUB00093967]]. They are required during vegetative growth and reproduction, PSI1 acts predominantly at the seedling stage whereas PSI2 and 3 are required for vegetative growth where they act synergistically. PSI1 and 3 may also have a function in carbohydrate metabolism [[cite:PUB00093967]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31730" "OS01G0873900 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein PSK SIMULATOR", "short" "PSI1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 245, "taxa" 948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2588, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1503}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045021", :literature {"PUB00093967" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Stuhrwohldt N" "Hartmann J" "Dahlke RI" "Oecking C" "Sauter M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
