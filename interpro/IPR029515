In vertebrates, there are two families of liprins, liprin-alpha and liprin-beta, which have four (alpha1-4) and two (beta1-2) members. In C. elegans and Drosophila, there are only one liprin-alpha (known as Syd-2 and Dliprin-alpha) and one liprin-beta. Another liprin family member, liprin-gamma, has also been identified in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00072838]]. Liprins contain an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal liprin homology (LH) region comprised of three sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains [[cite:PUB00065740]]. The N-terminal coiled coils of liprin-alpha mediate interactions with adapter proteins at the presynaptic active zone, while the SAM repeats bind proteins such as LAR receptor tyrosine phosphatase [[cite:PUB00070352]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6kip", "name" "Crystal structure of PTPRD phosphatase domain in complex with Liprin-alpha3 tandem SAM domains"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12587" "LAR INTERACTING PROTEIN LIP -RELATED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LAR-interacting protein, Liprin", "short" "Liprin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1031, "taxa" 4109, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17026, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9488}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029515", :literature {"PUB00072821" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Serra-Pages C" "Medley QG" "Tang M" "Hart A" "Streuli M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
