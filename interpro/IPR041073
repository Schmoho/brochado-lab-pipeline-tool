{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes members of relaxase enzymes. These enzymes initiate bacterial conjugation contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance.  These MobL relaxases are found mainly in Firmicutes. It is suggested that MobL type relaxases play a prominent role in horizontal gene transfer in Firmicutes bacteria. Family members carry a stretch of relaxase motif III 'HUH' sequence that is characteristic of the HUH endonuclease superfamily essential for enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00091426], [cite:PUB00151287]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF18555" "MobL relaxases"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MobL relaxases", "short" "MobL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 1473, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1828, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1828, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1323}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041073", :literature {"PUB00151287" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Garcillan-Barcia MP" "Redondo-Salvo S" "Vielva L" "de la Cruz F."], "ISO_journal" "Methods Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Methods Mol Biol", "title" "MOBscan: Automated Annotation of MOB Relaxases.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "295-308", "volume" "2075", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31584171}, "PUB00091426" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ramachandran G" "Miguel-Arribas A" "Abia D" "Singh PK" "Crespo I" "Gago-Cordoba C" "Hao JA" "Luque-Ortega JR" "Alfonso C" "Wu LJ" "Boer DR" "Meijer WJ."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006586", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "Discovery of a new family of relaxases in Firmicutes bacteria.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "e1006586", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28207825}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR041073", "name" "MobL relaxases", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR048101", "name" "MobP2 relaxase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR048102", "name" "MobP3 relaxase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 364}}}
