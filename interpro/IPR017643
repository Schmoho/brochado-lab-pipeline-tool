The enzyme has been characterised [[cite:PUB00042845]] and found to be specific for TSA, contain no cofactors, and have a rather high Km for hydroxypyruvate of 12.5 mM. The gene is often found in association with glyoxalate carboligase (which produces TSA), but has been shown to have no effect on growth on glyoxalate when knocked out [[cite:PUB00015767]]. This is consistent with the fact that the gene for tartronate semialdehyde reductase (glxR) is also associated and may have primary responsibility for the catabolism of TSA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036237", "name" "Xylose isomerase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03234" "hydroxypyruvate isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxypyruvate isomerase", "short" "Hydroxypyruvate_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 560, "taxa" 3501, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3967, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3967, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0689", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0689"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
