{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase ([ec:5.1.3.1]) (also known as RPE, pentose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase or PPE) is the enzyme that converts D-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) into D-xylulose 5-phosphate in Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle. In Ralstonia eutropha (Alcaligenes eutrophus) two copies of the gene coding for PPE are known [[cite:PUB00002204]], one is chromosomally encoded [swissprot:P40117], the other one is on a plasmid [swissprot:Q04539]. PPE has been found in a wide range of bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi and plants. All the proteins have from 209 to 241 amino acid residues.
