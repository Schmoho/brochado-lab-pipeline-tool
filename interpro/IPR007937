RNA polymerase subunits are synthesized throughout infection and the assembled RNA polymerase is packaged into nascent virions late in infection. The RNA polymerase exists in two different forms, one specific for early genes and one specific for late genes. Both forms of the RNA polymerase have in common eight subunits, ranging in size from 147 to 7kDa This family consists of several poxvirus DNA-dependent RNA polymerase 22kDa subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05273" "Poxvirus RNA polymerase 22 kDa subunit"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000744" "Predicted DNA-directed RNA polymerase, RPO22 subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase, 22kDa subunit, poxviral", "short" "RNA_Pol_22kDa_poxvir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 127, "sets" 0, "proteins" 127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
