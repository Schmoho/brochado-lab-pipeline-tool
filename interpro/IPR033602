{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents homologues of Ciliary microtubule-associated protein 3 (CIMAP3, also known as Protein Pitchfork). CIMAP3 is an axonemal microtubule-associated (MAP). It belongs to the group of wedge-MAPs that occupy the inter-protofilament cleft between protofilaments A03/A04. It alternates with CIMAP2 along the DMT, resulting in an overall periodicity of 96 nm [[cite:PUB00151496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The primary cilium (PC) is a microtubule (MT)-based organelle that emanates from the cell surface of most mammalian cell types during growth arrest. It is anchored by the mother centriole of the centrosome, known as basal body (BB). Pitchfork associates with ciliary targeting complexes and regulates primary cilia (PC) disassembly. It interacts and co-localizes with alpha, beta, gamma-Tubulin, MT-dependent motor proteins, small GTPases involved in vesicular trafficking and is dynamically transported along ciliary axonemal MTs. It has been shown to activate Aurora A, a protooncogenic kinase that induces cilia retraction [[cite:PUB00079247]]. In vertebrates, the PC acts as the key-signalling hub for the Hedgehog pathway, which regulates diverse aspects of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Pitchfork is involved, together with Gprasp2, in targeting Smoothened to the primary cilium for the activation of the Hedgehog pathway [[cite:PUB00079246]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31508" "PROTEIN PITCHFORK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ciliary microtubule-associated protein 3", "short" "CIMAP3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 541, "taxa" 2345, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1026, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 607}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033602", :literature {"PUB00079246" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jung B" "Padula D" "Burtscher I" "Landerer C" "Lutter D" "Theis F" "Messias AC" "Geerlof A" "Sattler M" "Kremmer E" "Boldt K" "Ueffing M" "Lickert H."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149477", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Pitchfork and Gprasp2 Target Smoothened to the Primary Cilium for Hedgehog Pathway Activation.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0149477", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26901434}, "PUB00079247" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kinzel D" "Boldt K" "Davis EE" "Burtscher I" "Trumbach D" "Diplas B" "Attie-Bitach T" "Wurst W" "Katsanis N" "Ueffing M" "Lickert H."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
