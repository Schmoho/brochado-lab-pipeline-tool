{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of a number of carbohydrate sulphotransferases that transfer sulphate to carbohydrate groups in glycoproteins and glycolipids. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n\n<ul><li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferases 8 and 9, which transfer sulphate to position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans [[cite:PUB00033954]]. They function in the biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, by mediating sulphation of their carbohydrate structures.</li></ul>\r\n\n<ul><li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferase 10, which transfers sulphate to position 3 of the terminal glucuronic acid in both protein- and lipid-linked oligosaccharides [[cite:PUB00033955]]. It directs the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate structure, a sulphated glucuronyl-lactosaminyl residue carried by many neural recognition molecules, which is involved in cell interactions during ontogenetic development and in synaptic plasticity in the adult.</li></ul>\r\n\n<ul><li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferases 11 - 13, which catalyze the transfer of sulphate to position 4 of the GalNAc residue of chondroitin [[cite:PUB00033956]]. The orthologue in<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>is known as carbohydrate sulfotransferase chst-1 [[cite:PUB00085650]].  Chondroitin sulphate constitutes the predominant proteoglycan present in cartilage and is distributed on the surfaces of many cells and extracellular matrices. Some, thought not all, of these enzymes also transfer sulphate to dermatan.</li></ul>\r\n\n<ul><li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferase D4ST1, which transfers sulphate to position 4 of the GalNAc residue of dermatan sulphate [[cite:PUB00033957]].</li></ul>\r\n\n<ul><li>Heparan sulphate 2-O-sulphotransferase (HS2ST). Heparan sulphate (HS) is a co-receptor for a number of growth factors, morphogens, and adhesion proteins. HS biosynthetic modifications may determine the strength and outcome of HS-ligand interactions. Mice that lack HS2ST undergo developmental failure only after midgestation,the most dramatic effect being the complete failure of kidney development [[cite:PUB00010170]].</li></ul>\r\n\n<ul><li>Heparan-sulphate 6-O-sulphotransferase (HS6ST), which catalyses the transfer of sulphate from adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulphate to the 6th position of the N -sulphoglucosamine residue in heparan sulphate [[cite:PUB00012826]].</li></ul>\r\n\n<ul><li>Chondroitin 6-sulphotransferase catalyses the transfer of sulphate to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine residue of chondroitin [[cite:PUB00053392]].</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03567" "Sulfotransferase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfotransferase", "short" "Sulfotransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 329, "proteomes" 2370, "taxa" 10124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29130, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28836, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19660}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
