There are five known TSF families, which are named for the first characterised member [[cite:PUB00087016]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase (MSAD) family [[cite:PUB00087017]]. MSAD is part of a bacterial pathway for the degradation of the soil fumigant known as 1,3-dichloropropene [[cite:PUB00087017]]. There are five homologues identified, including YusQ/YodA/YrdN from Bacillus subtilis, IolK from Lactobacillus casei strain BL23, and Bp4401 from Burkholderia phymatum. IolK was found in a degradative pathway for myo-inositol, but its disruption does not affect growth or myo-inositol utilization [[cite:PUB00087018]]. Bp4401 has a modest hydratase activity. YrdN, YodA, and IolK have comparable decarboxylase and hydratase activities, but this activity is missing in YusQ and Bp4401 [[cite:PUB00087016]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2aal", "name" "Crystal Structures of the Wild-type, Mutant-P1A and Inactivated Malonate Semialdehyde Decarboxylase: A Structural Basis for the Decarboxylase and Hydratase Activities"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014347", "name" "Tautomerase/MIF superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38460" "TAUTOMERASE YOLI-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF14552" "Tautomerase enzyme"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tautomerase, MSAD family", "short" "Tauto_MSAD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 1586, "taxa" 7398, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7352, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7351, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5707}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
