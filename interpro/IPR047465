{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a probable C-mannosyltransferase by its similarity to Dpy-19. It is known as Dpy-19-like protein 3 (DPY19L3).</p>\n\n<p>Dpy19 proteins are C-mannosyltransferases that mediate C-mannosylation of tryptophan residues on target proteins. C-mannosylation is the attachment of alpha-mannose to the indole C2 carbon of the first tryptophan residue in the consensus amino acid sequence Trp-Xaa-Xaa-Trp/Cys through a C-C bond. This reaction takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Dpy19 is a transmembrane domain family whose name is derived from the Caenorhabditis elegans Dumpy mutant [[cite:PUB00044879], [cite:PUB00071504]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20181" "C-mannosyltransferase Dpy-19-like protein 3 (Dpy19L3)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-mannosyltransferase Dpy-19-like protein 3", "short" "Dpy19L3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 408, "taxa" 1276, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 533, "sets" 0, "proteins" 533, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 411}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
