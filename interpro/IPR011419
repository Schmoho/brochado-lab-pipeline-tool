{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group proteins from eukaryotes and bacteria that may have chaperone activity and be involved in F1 ATPase complex assembly. The eukaryotic proteins include yeast ATP12 [[cite:PUB00014715]] and mammalian homologue ATPAF2 (ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 2) [[cite:PUB00081959]], which are required for assembly of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitochondrial F1-ATPase is an oligomeric enzyme composed of five distinct subunit polypeptides. The alpha and beta subunits make up the bulk of protein mass of F1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae both subunits are synthesised as precursors with N-terminal targeting signals that are removed upon translocation of the proteins to the matrix compartment [[cite:PUB00014715]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zd2", "name" "D202K mutant of P. denitrificans Atp12p"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023335", "name" "ATP12 orthogonal Bundle domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042272", "name" "ATP12, ATP synthase F1-assembly protein, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07542" "ATP12 chaperone protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR21013" "ATP SYNTHASE MITOCHONDRIAL F1 COMPLEX ASSEMBLY FACTOR 2/ATP12 PROTEIN, MITOCHONDRIAL PRECURSOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP12, ATP synthase F1-assembly protein", "short" "ATP12_ATP_synth-F1-assembly"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 88, "proteomes" 4010, "taxa" 13094, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8876, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8831, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6315}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011419", :literature {"PUB00081959" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Pickova A" "Paul J" "Petruzzella V" "Houstek J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00890-1", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Differential expression of ATPAF1 and ATPAF2 genes encoding F(1)-ATPase assembly proteins in mouse tissues.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "42-6", "volume" "551", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12965202}, "PUB00014715" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Bowman S" "Ackerman SH" "Griffiths DE" "Tzagoloff A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
