{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small family of secreted proteins from halophilic archaea [[cite:PUB00105575]]. Members of this family has either lipoprotein signal peptide at the N terminus, or a PGF-CTERM sorting signal at the C terminus, but never both. These types of sorting signals are processed in a way that, after their removal, a lipid moiety is left at the new terminus that anchors the protein in the plasma membrane.</p>\n\n<p>The central region of these proteins has a weak sequence similarity and is predicted to adopt the structure of metalloproteases ('zincins') catalytic domain. Residues that constitute the active site of 'zincins' are also conserved across the members of this family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038145" "Hvo_1808 family surface protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Surface protein Hvo_1808-like", "short" "Hvo_1808-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 596, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 710, "sets" 0, "proteins" 709, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 617}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047792", :literature {"PUB00105575" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Storf S" "Pfeiffer F" "Dilks K" "Chen ZQ" "Imam S" "Pohlschroder M."], "ISO_journal" "Archaea", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Archaea", "title" "Mutational and bioinformatic analysis of haloarchaeal lipobox-containing proteins.
