{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The F-actin capping protein binds in a calcium-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike gelsolin and severin this protein does not sever actin filaments. The F-actin capping protein is a heterodimer composed of two unrelated subunits: alpha and beta (see [interpro:IPR001698]). Neither of the subunits shows sequence similarity to other filament-capping proteins [[cite:PUB00002626]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represent the alpha subunit (CAPZA), which is a protein of about 268 to 286 amino acid residues whose sequence is well conserved in eukaryotic species [[cite:PUB00000981]]. In Drosophila mutations in the alpha and beta subunits cause actin accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration [[cite:PUB00071410]]. In humans CAPZA is part of the WASH complex that controls the fission of endosomes [[cite:PUB00054152]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ds6", "name" "Crystal structure of actin capping protein in complex with twinflin-1/CD2AP CPI chimera peptide (TWN-CDC)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037282", "name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042489", "name" "F-actin capping protein, alpha subunit, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042276", "name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha/beta, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10653" "F-ACTIN-CAPPING PROTEIN SUBUNIT ALPHA"}, "prints" {"PR00191" "FACTINCAPA"}, "pfam" {"PF01267" "F-actin capping protein alpha subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha", "short" "CapZ_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 86, "proteomes" 2544, "taxa" 8748, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6705, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6434, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4193}, "pathways" 47}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002189", :literature {"PUB00002626" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Maruyama K" "Kurokawa H" "Oosawa M" "Shimaoka S" "Yamamoto H" "Ito M" "Maruyama K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
