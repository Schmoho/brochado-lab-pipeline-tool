{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of fungal proteins that are related to the nuclease A inhibitor NuiA ([interpro:IPR012489]). NuiA is known to regulate the activity of NucA, one of the most potent nucleases involved in degradation of both single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA. The NucA inhibition by NuiA involves an unusual divalent metal ion bridge that connects the nuclease with its inhibitor. A highly conserved glutamate extends into the active site, mimicking the charge of a phosphate. The functionally essential glutamate is conserved within this family. In some members, it is replaced with aspartate. Most members of this family bear a deletion affecting the second interaction site located on one of the two 'jaws' of the NuiA structure and known to contribute to the specificity and strength of the NuiA-NucA interaction. The lack of this region indicates some functional differences of this group of potential inhibitors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23151" "NuiA-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR42093" "PTHR42093"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NuiA-like", "short" "NuiA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 671, "taxa" 1680, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 983, "sets" 0, "proteins" 975, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 629}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056539", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056539", "name" "NuiA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 50, "alignment:full" 492}}}
