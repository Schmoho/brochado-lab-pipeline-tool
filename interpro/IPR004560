{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase UlaE and SgbU from Escherichia coli and other bacterial species. L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase ([ec:5.1.3.22]) is involved in isomerisation of L-xylulose-5-phosphate to L-ribulose-5-phosphate. Along with UlaD and UlaF, UlaE is involved in a pathway leading to fermentation of l-ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. UlaE in E. coli adopts a TIM barrel fold with the active site  located at the C-terminal ends of the parallel β-strands.  UlaE forms back-to-back dimers [[cite:PUB00051092]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The ulaABCDEF operon encodes an L-ascorbate phosphotransferase transport system (UlaABC, formerly designated SgaTBA)responsible for the uptake and phosphorylation of L-ascorbate. The ulaDEF genes encode three enzymes that catalyze the anaerobic conversion of the phosphorylated, hydrolytic product of L-ascorbate, 3-keto-L-gulonate-6-phosphate, to D-xylulose-5-phosphate, which is subsequently metabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway. UlaD catalyzes a β-keto acid decarboxylation reaction to produce L-xylulose-5-phosphate, which undergoes successive epimerization reactions with UlaE (L-xylulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase) and UlaF (L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase), yielding D-xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036237", "name" "Xylose isomerase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00542" "L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase", "short" "L-Ru-5P_3-Epase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 376, "taxa" 2516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3488, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3488, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2685}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
