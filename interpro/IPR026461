{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes diverse glycosyltransferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, having two tightly associated β/α/β domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight β-strands. These are enzymes that catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds [[cite:PUB00080740], [cite:PUB00015209], [cite:PUB00080741], [cite:PUB00080744]]. Other members of the entry include are proposed to be a nucleotide transferase and a phosphoesterase.
