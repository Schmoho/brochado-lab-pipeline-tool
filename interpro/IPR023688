{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the cell division protein ZapA. ZapA interacts with FtsZ, where FtsZ is part of a mid-cell cytokinetic structure termed the Z-ring that recruits a hierarchy of fission related proteins early in the bacterial cell cycle. ZapA drives the polymerisation and filament bundling of FtsZ, thereby contributing to the spatio-temporal tuning of the Z-ring. ZapA is recruited early at mid-cell but it is not essential for cell division [[cite:PUB00021078]]. In sporulating cells, ZapA localizes near the cell poles. The proteins in this entry belongs to the ZapA Type 2 subfamily.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036192", "name" "Cell division protein ZapA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR053712", "name" "Bacterial Cell Division Activator", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02013" "Cell division protein ZapA [zapA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein ZapA, firmicutes", "short" "Cell_div_ZapA_firmicutes"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 360, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 350, "sets" 0, "proteins" 350, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 241}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023688", :literature {"PUB00021078" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Gueiros-Filho FJ" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1014102", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "A widely conserved bacterial cell division protein that promotes assembly of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "2544-56", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12368265}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0051301", "name" "cell division", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007838", "name" "Cell division protein ZapA-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023688", "name" "Cell division protein ZapA, firmicutes", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023771", "name" "Cell division protein ZapA, eubacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
