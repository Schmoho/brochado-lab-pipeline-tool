{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A highly diverged class of S-adenosylmethionine synthetases have been identified in the archaea. S-adenosylmethionine is the primary alkylating agent in all known organisms. ATP:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase (MAT) catalyses the only known biosynthetic route to this central metabolite. Although the amino acid sequence of MAT is strongly conserved among bacteria and eukarya (see [interpro:IPR002133]) no homologues had been recognised in the completed genome sequences of any archaea. The identification of a second major class of MAT emphasises the long evolutionary history of the archaeal lineage and the structural diversity found even in crucial metabolic enzymes [[cite:PUB00006472]]. Three bacterial genomes encode both the archaeal and eukaryotic/bacterial types of MAT [[cite:PUB00006472]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6s81", "name" "Crystal structure of methionine adenosyltransferase from Pyrococcus furiosus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00136" "S-adenosylmethionine synthase [mat]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, archaea", "short" "S-AdoMet_synthetase_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 205, "taxa" 1300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1008, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1008, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 889}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
