{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the MiaB enzyme and homologues that are responsible for the modification of the isopentenylated adenine-37 base of most bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs that read codons beginning with uracil (all except tRNA(I,V) Ser).  Adenine-37 is next to the anticodon on the 3' side in these tRNA's, and lack of modification at this site leads to an increased spontaneous mutation frequency.  Isopentenylated A-37 is modified by methylthiolation at position 2 leading to the formation of 2-methylthio-N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine, either by MiaB alone or in concert with a separate methylase yet to be discovered [[cite:PUB00009727]]. MiaB contains two 4Fe-4S clusters which are labile under oxidizing conditions [[cite:PUB00009728], [cite:PUB00083447]]. One cluster is coordinated with three cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the other is thought to be the sulfur donor.  The second cluster has a polysulfide group bound to it, which is methylated in the first reaction step.  Concurrently, the SAM-[4Fe-4S] cluster forms the 5'-dAdo radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, which is then methylthiolated by the methylated polysulfide group [[cite:PUB00017717], [cite:PUB00083446], [cite:PUB00083448]].  Additionally, the sequence is homologous to the biotin synthetase, BioB, which utilises both an iron-sulfur cluster and S-adenosym methionine (SAM) to generate a radical which is responsible for initiating the insertion of sulfur into the substrate [[cite:PUB00009729]].  It is reasonable to surmise that the methyl group of SAM becomes the methyl group of the product, but this has not been shown, and the possibility of a separate methylase exists.  These enzymes contain a TRAM domain [[cite:PUB00009729]] which is believed to be responsible for binding to tRNAs. The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima has been cloned, expressed, spectroscopically characterised and shown to complement the E. coli MiaB enzyme [[cite:PUB00017717]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7mjw", "name" "Methylated MiaB in the complex with 5'-deoxyadenosine, methionine and RNA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023404", "name" "Radical SAM, alpha/beta horseshoe", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00273" "(dimethylallyl)adenosine tRNA methylthiotransferase (MiaB-like)"}, "hamap" {"MF_01864" "tRNA-2-methylthio-N(6)-dimethylallyladenosine synthase [miaB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA-2-methylthio-N(6)-dimethylallyladenosine synthase MiaB", "short" "MiaB_methiolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9632, "taxa" 36250, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37279, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37279, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28134}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
