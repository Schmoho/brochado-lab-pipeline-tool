This entry represents the gammaproteobacteria family of DapD sequences, which is the most closely related to the actinobacterial DapD family represented by [interpro:IPR019875]. All of the genes evaluated for the seed of this model are found in genomes where the downstream desuccinylase is present, but known DapD genes are absent. Additionally, many of the genes identified by this model are found proximal to genes involved in this lysine biosynthesis pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3r5d", "name" "Pseudomonas aeruginosa DapD (PA3666) apoprotein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011004", "name" "Trimeric LpxA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03536" "2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate N-succinyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate N-succinyltransferase, gammaproteobacteria", "short" "DapD_gammaproteobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 349, "taxa" 1848, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2012, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2012, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1601}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0786", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0786"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
