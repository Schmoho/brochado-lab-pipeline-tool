{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Several NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases, including 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, tartrate dehydrogenase, and the multimeric forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase, share a nucleotide binding domain unrelated to that of lactate dehydrogenase and its homologues. These enzymes dehydrogenate their substates at a H-C-OH site adjacent to a H-C-COOH site; the latter carbon, now adjacent to a carbonyl group, readily decarboxylates.</p>\n\n<p>Mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) resemble prokaryotic NADP-dependent IDH and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (an NAD-dependent enzyme) more closely than they resemble eukaryotic NADP-dependent IDH. The mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is believed to be an α(2)-β-γ heterotetramer. All subunits are homologous and belog to this group.</p>\n\n<p>The NADP-dependent IDH of Thermus thermophilus strain HB8 resembles these NAD-dependent IDH, except for the residues involved in cofactor specificity, much more closely than it resembles other prokaryotic NADP-dependent IDH, including that of Thermus aquaticus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00175" "isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+))"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase NAD-dependent", "short" "Isocitrate_DH_NAD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2510, "taxa" 8617, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10566, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10564, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6577}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
