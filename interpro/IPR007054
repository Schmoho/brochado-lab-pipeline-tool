{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains a family of small hydrophobic holin proteins with one or more transmembrane domains. Members of this family fall into the holin superfamily II, and Phage 21 S holin is the prototype for this superfamily. It has two transmembrane segments with both the N- and C-termini on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane in E. coli. Holins are a diverse family of proteins that cause bacterial membrane lysis during late-protein synthesis. It is thought that the temporal precision of holin-mediated lysis may occur through the build up of a holin oligomer which causes the lysis [[cite:PUB00008724], [cite:PUB00084995]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF030786" "Predicted phage-associated lysis protein S"}, "pfam" {"PF04971" "Bacteriophage P21 holin S"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysis protein S", "short" "Lysis_S"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 142, "taxa" 909, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1338, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1338, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 725}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007054", :literature {"PUB00008724" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Rietsch A" "Blasi U."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
