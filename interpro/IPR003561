{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MutT is a small bacterial protein (~12-15kDa) involved in the GO system [[cite:PUB00002202]]. MutT is known as a mutator gene because mutations in the gene specifically increase the rate of  AT:GC tranversions. MutT is a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatase converting  8-oxoguanine triphosphatase to the monophosphate with high efficiency. It acts both on 8-oxoGTP as well as 8-oxodGTP. It also can convert, less efficiently, the GDP and dGDP forms to the monophosphates [[cite:PUB00053829], [cite:PUB00053830]]. Consequently it reduces the availability of 8-oxoGTP and the rate of mutation. It was suggested that MutT may ensure transcriptional fidelity, removing 8-oxo-GTP from the ribonucleotide triphosphate pool, however, due to the lower efficiency of RNA polymerase 8-oxo-GTP incorporation, MutT is probably not a major contributor to transcriptional fidelity [[cite:PUB00101991].</p>\n\n<p>A short conserved N-terminal region of mutT (designated the MutT domain) is also found in a variety of other prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic proteins [[cite:PUB00004433], [cite:PUB00003856], [cite:PUB00002808], [cite:PUB00006677]]. Recently, the generic name `NUDIX hydrolases' (NUcleoside DIphosphate linked to some other moiety X) has been coined for this domain family [[cite:PUB00006662]].</p>\n\n<p>The solution structure of the MutT enzyme has been solved by NMR [[cite:PUB00006656]]. The structure is globular and compact, and contains a five-stranded mixed β-sheet. The parallel portion of the sheet is sandwiched between two α-helices, forming an α+β fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ww6", "name" "Crystal structure of MutT-8-oxo-dGTP complex: Reaction for 20 min in 5 mM Mn2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00586" "8-oxo-dGTP diphosphatase MutT"}, "prints" {"PR01401" "MUTATORMUTT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mutator MutT", "short" "Mutator_MutT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1898, "taxa" 9401, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8922, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6901}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
