{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aerolysin [[cite:PUB00002061]] is a cytolytic toxin exported by Aeromonas hydrophila, a Gram-negative bacterium associated with diarrhoeal diseases and deep wound infections [[cite:PUB00004166]]. The mature toxin binds to eukaryotic cells and aggregates to form holes (approximately 3 nm in diameter) leading to the destruction of the membrane permeability barrier and osmotic lysis. The structure of proaerolysin has been determined to 2.8A resolution and shows the protoxin to adopt a novel fold [[cite:PUB00004166]]. Images of an aerolysin oligomer derived from electron microscopy have helped to construct a model of the protein and to outline a mechanism by which it might insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channels [[cite:PUB00004166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00754" "AEROLYSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aerolysin", "short" "Aerolysn"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2470, "sets" 0, "proteins" 429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 349}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005830", :literature {"PUB00002061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Howard SP" "Garland WJ" "Green MJ" "Buckley JT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
