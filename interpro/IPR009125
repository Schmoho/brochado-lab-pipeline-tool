{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ATP synthase membrane subunit K (ATPMK, also known as DAPIT) is a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain [[cite:PUB00089720], [cite:PUB00089719]].
