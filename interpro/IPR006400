{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hopanoids are planar, polycyclic hydrocarbons similar to eukaryotic sterols, containing five rings instead of the four rings in sterols, and they have a variety of polar and nonpolar side chains. Hopanoids and sterols share structural and functional similarities, for example, both lipid classes are able to modulate the fluidity and permeability of membranes [[cite:PUB00098590]]. These lipids are found in diverse bacteria and in a handful of lichens and plants. Squalene hopene cyclase (SHC) belongs to the triterpenoid cyclase family of enzymes, involved in hopanoid (triterpenoid) biosynthesis. SHC is an integral membrane protein that directly cyclizes squalene into hopanoid products [[cite:PUB00098590], [cite:PUB00005227]]. Sequence and structure similarities of the active sites of epoxysqualene or oxidosqualene cyclases and SHCs suggest that these enzyme families are evolutionarily related [[cite:PUB00098590]]. SCH are predominantly found in bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2sqc", "name" "SQUALENE-HOPENE CYCLASE FROM ALICYCLOBACILLUS ACIDOCALDARIUS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008930", "name" "Terpenoid cyclases/protein prenyltransferase alpha-alpha toroid", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01507" "squalene--hopene cyclase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Squalene hopene cyclase", "short" "Hopene-cyclase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1507, "taxa" 5859, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6031, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6031, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4456}, "pathways" 206}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
