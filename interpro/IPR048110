{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include SA1362 from Staphylococcus aureus ([swissprot:A0A0H3JQ65]) and the uncharacterised protein YqhP from Bacillus subtilis ([swissprot:P54514]). The N-terminal 50 amino acid residues of these proteins are highly hydrophobic suggesting the presence of two transmembrane Î±-helical regions. The C-terminal region is rich in basic residues, variable in number, and often repetitive. The members of this family are found in Gram-positive bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041554" "SA1362 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SA1362/YqhP-like", "short" "SA1362/YqhP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 314, "taxa" 1050, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 988, "sets" 0, "proteins" 988, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 739}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048110", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048110", "name" "SA1362/YqhP-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
