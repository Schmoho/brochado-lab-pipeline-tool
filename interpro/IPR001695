{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lysyl oxidase ([ec:1.4.3.13]) (LOX) [[cite:PUB00000655]] is an extracellular copper-dependent enzyme that catalyses the oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine residues in precursors of various collagens and elastins, yielding alpha-aminoadipic-delta-semialdehyde. The deaminated lysines are then able to form semialdehyde cross-links, resulting in the formation of insoluble collagen and elastin fibres in the extracellular matrix [[cite:PUB00003553]].</p>\r\n<p>The active site of LOX resides towards the C terminus: this region also binds a single copper atom in an octahedral coordination complex involving at least 3 His residues [[cite:PUB00002724]]. Four histidine residues are clustered in a central region of the enzyme. This region is thought to be involved in cooper-binding and is called the 'copper-talon' [[cite:PUB00000655]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00074" "LYSYLOXIDASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01186" "Lysyl oxidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysyl oxidase", "short" "Lysyl_oxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 174, "proteomes" 1205, "taxa" 5122, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 4, "matches" 9356, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5597}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00716", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00716"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
