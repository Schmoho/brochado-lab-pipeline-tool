{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Calicivirus VP2 proteins [[cite:PUB00097361]]. VP2 is a minor capsid protein encoded by all caliciviruses. It forms a large portal-like assembly at a unique three-fold axis of symmetry, following receptor engagement. This assembly-which was not detected in undecorated virions-is formed of twelve copies of VP2, arranged with their hydrophobic N terminus pointing away from the virion surface.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05332" "Vesivirus VP2 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesivirus VP2", "short" "Vesivirus_VP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 36, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 86, "sets" 0, "proteins" 86, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007996", :literature {"PUB00097361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7739", "authors" ["Conley MJ" "McElwee M" "Azmi L" "Gabrielsen M" "Byron O" "Goodfellow IG" "Bhella D."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Calicivirus VP2 forms a portal-like assembly following receptor engagement.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "377-381", "volume" "565", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30626974}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007996", "name" "Vesivirus VP2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 2}}}
