{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family contains Xin repeats, which define an actin-binding motif. In humans two Xin-repeat proteins have been identified, XIRP1 and XIRP2. They are expressed during early developmental stages of cardiac and skeletal muscles [[cite:PUB00033634]] and have an important role in cardiac development and function [[cite:PUB00072621]]. They bind to and stabilise F-actin [[cite:PUB00044749]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The homologues in mouse and chicken localise in the adherens junction complex of the intercalated disc in cardiac muscle and in the myotendon junction of skeletal muscle. Mouse Xin may co-localise with Vinculin which is known to attach the actin to the cytoplasmic membrane [[cite:PUB00016566]]. Human XIRP1 binds the EVH1 domains of Ena/VASP proteins and filamin C [[cite:PUB00044749]]. It also binds the SH3 domain of nebulin and nebulette [[cite:PUB00072622]]. The multiplicity of binding partners suggests that Xin acts as a multi-adaptor protein during myofibril development and repair [[cite:PUB00072623]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22591" "XIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 1/2", "short" "XIRP1/XIRP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 613, "taxa" 2092, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1961, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1961, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 383}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030072", :literature {"PUB00072621" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Wang Q" "Lin JL" "Erives AJ" "Lin CI" "Lin JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Int Rev Cell Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800180-6.00003-7", "medline_journal" "Int Rev Cell Mol Biol", "title" "New insights into the roles of Xin repeat-containing proteins in cardiac development, function, and disease.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "89-128", "volume" "310", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24725425}, "PUB00016566" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sinn HW" "Balsamo J" "Lilien J" "Lin JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
