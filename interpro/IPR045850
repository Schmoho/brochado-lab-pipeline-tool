{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase homologues ([ec:2.1.1.35]), mainly found in metazoa, including tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase homologue A (TRMT2A) and B (TRMT2B) from human. TRMT2A catalyses the formation of 5-methyl-uridine in tRNAs and some mRNAs [[cite:PUB00100734], [cite:PUB00100735], [cite:PUB00100733]]. TRMT2A/B mainly catalyse the methylation of uridine at position 54 (m5U54) in cytosolic tRNAs [[cite:PUB00100734], [cite:PUB00100735]]. This family also includes the plant homologue AtC3H24 (also known as TRNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 2B) [[cite:PUB00100736]] and putative RNA methyltransferases R405/407 from Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (EC [ec:2.1.1.-]) constitute an important class of enzymes present in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as oxygen leading to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and a methylated molecule [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]]. All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]]. The substrates that are methylated by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small molecules, to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00006319]]. Methyltransferase are therefore involved in many essential cellular processes including biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]].
