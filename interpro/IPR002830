{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is found in prokaryotes, archaea and fungi, with two members in Archaeoglobus fulgidus. They are related to UbiD, a 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (also known as polyprenyl p-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase) from Escherichia coli that is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00008052]]. The member from Helicobacter pylori has a C-terminal extension of just over 100 residues that is shared, in part, by the Aquifex aeolicus homologue.</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry includes:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Bacterial UbiD that catalyses the decarboxylation of 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxy benzoate to 2-octaprenylphenol. It is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00008052]].</li>\n<li>Budding yeast Fdc1 that catalyses the reversible decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids like ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid or cinnamic acid, producing the corresponding vinyl derivatives 4-vinylphenol, 4-vinylguaiacol, and styrene, respectively, which play the role of aroma metabolites [[cite:PUB00077012], [cite:PUB00077013]]. Fdc1 is not essential for ubiquinone synthesis [[cite:PUB00077012]].</li>\n\n<li>4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase subunit C (also known as HBDC) that catalyses the reversible decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate [[cite:PUB00077014]].</li>\n\n<li>Phenolic acid decarboxylase subunit C (YclC) that can catalyse the reversible decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate [[cite:PUB00077009], [cite:PUB00077010], [cite:PUB00077007]] and can also decarboxylate 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate [[cite:PUB00077010]].</li>\n\n<li>Anhydromevalonate phosphate decarboxylase which is involved in Involved in the archaeal mevalonate pathway and catalyses the conversion of trans-anhydromevalonate 5-phosphate (tAHMP) into isopentenyl phosphate [[cite:PUB00098043]].</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4zac", "name" "Structure of S. cerevisiae Fdc1 with the prenylated-flavin cofactor in the iminium form."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30108" "3-OCTAPRENYL-4-HYDROXYBENZOATE CARBOXY-LYASE-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00148" "UbiD family decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UbiD decarboxylyase family", "short" "UbiD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 81, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4561, "taxa" 19884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33445, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32511, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24287}, "pathways" 47}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1744", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1744"} {"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
