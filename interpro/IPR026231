{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>During mitosis, genomic integrity is maintained by the proper coordination of mitotic events through the spindle checkpoint. The bifurcated spindle checkpoint blocks cell-cycle progression at metaphase by monitoring unattached kinetochores, and inhibits mitotic exit in response to the incorrect orientation of the mitotic spindle. Bfa1p is a budding yeast spindle checkpoint regulator in the Bub2p checkpoint pathway for proper mitotic exit. A Bfa1p interacting protein, termed Ibd2p, has been identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00060305]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IBD2 (Inhibition of Bud Division 2) is not an essential gene. However, over-expression of Ibd2p has been shown to induce mitotic arrest, with increased levels of Clb2p in wild type and mad2Delta, but not in deletion mutants of BUB2 and BFA1. Overall, it is thought likely that IBD2 encodes a novel component of the BUB2-dependent spindle checkpoint pathway that functions upstream of BUB2 and BFA1 [[cite:PUB00053335]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02099" "Protein IBD2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein IBD2", "short" "IBD2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 24, "taxa" 110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 55, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026231", :literature {"PUB00053335" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Liu Y" "Zhang W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
