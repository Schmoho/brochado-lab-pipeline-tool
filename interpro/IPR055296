{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 2 protein (SRL2) from Oryza sativa and related plant proteins. SRL2 is involved in the regulation of leaf development, specifically in the modulation of leaf rolling [[cite:PUB00155317]]. This protein is mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells. SRL2 was implicated in the cellular differentiation processes on the abaxial (lower) side of leaves, influencing the development of specific cell types that contribute to the leaf's structure. This protein may play a role in the transdifferentiation of mesophyll cells into sclerenchymatous cells, which are known for their supportive function in plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46087" "PUTATIVE, EXPRESSED-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 2-like", "short" "SRL2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 275, "taxa" 1043, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3379, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3379, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2053}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055296", :literature {"PUB00155317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Liu X" "Li M" "Liu K" "Tang D" "Sun M" "Li Y" "Shen Y" "Du G" "Cheng Z."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erw029", "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "2139-50", "volume" "67", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26873975}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055296", "name" "SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
