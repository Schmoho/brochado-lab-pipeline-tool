{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell exterior [[cite:PUB00007655]]. Four principal exotoxin secretion systems have been described. In the type II and IV secretion systems, toxins are first exported to the periplasm by way of a cleaved N-terminal signal sequence; a second set of proteins is used for extracellular transport (type II), or the C terminus of the exotoxin itself is used (type IV). Type III secretion involves at least 20 molecules that assemble into a needle; effector proteins are then translocated through this without need of a signal sequence. In the Type I system, a complete channel is formed through both membranes, and the secretion signal is carried on the C terminus of the exotoxin.</p>\n\n<p>The RTX (repeats in toxin) family of cytolytic toxins belong to the Type I secretion system, and are important virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria. As well as the C-terminal signal sequence, several glycine-rich repeats are also found. These are essential for binding calcium, and are critical for the biological activity of the secreted toxins [[cite:PUB00007656]]. All RTX toxin operons exist in the order rtxCABD, RtxA protein being the structural component of the exotoxin, both RtxB and D being required for its export from the bacterial cell; RtxC is an acyl-carrier-protein-dependent acyl- modification enzyme, required to convert RtxA to its active form [[cite:PUB00007657]].</p>\n\n<p>Escherichia coli haemolysin (HlyA) is often quoted as the model for RTX toxins. Recent work on its relative rtxC gene product HlyC [[cite:PUB00007658]] has revealed that it provides the acylation aspect for post-translational modification of two internal lysine residues in the HlyA protein. Other residues, including His23 and two conserved tyrosine residues, also appear to be important [[cite:PUB00007660]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02794" "RTX toxin acyltransferase family"}, "prints" {"PR01489" "RTXTOXINC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RTX toxin-activating protein C, bacteria", "short" "RTX_toxin-activating_protC_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1857, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1741, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1579, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1236}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
