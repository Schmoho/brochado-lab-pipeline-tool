{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Heparan sulphate (HS) is a long unbranched polysaccharide found covalently attached to various proteins at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, where it acts as a co-receptor for a number of growth factors, morphogens, and adhesion proteins. HS-O-sulphotransferase (Hs2st) occupies a critical position in the succession of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of HS, catalysing the transfer of sulphate to the C2-position of selected hexuronic acid residues within the nascent HS chain. Mice that lack HS2ST undergo developmental failure after midgestation, the most dramatic effect being the complete failure of kidney development [[cite:PUB00010170]]. This family is related to [interpro:IPR005331].</p>\n\n<p>Uronyl 2-sulfotransferase, a sulfotransferase that catalyses the transfer of sulfate to the position 2 of uronyl residues in glycosaminoglycan chains [[cite:PUB00158970], [cite:PUB00158971]], is also included in this entry. It has mainly activity toward iduronyl residues in dermatan sulfate, and weaker activity toward glucuronyl residues of chondroitin sulfate [[cite:PUB00158970]] and it has little to no activity toward desulfated N-resulfated heparin or N-sulfoheparosan [[cite:PUB00158970], [cite:PUB00158971]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12129" "HEPARAN SULFATE 2-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heparan sulphate 2-O-sulfotransferase", "short" "Heparan_SO4_2-O-STrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1051, "taxa" 4508, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4201, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4201, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2822}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
