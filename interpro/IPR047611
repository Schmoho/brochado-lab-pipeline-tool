{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents homologues of replication protein C (RepC). repABC plasmids are widely distributed among alphaproteobacteria; all repABC operons contain at least three protein-encoding genes: repA, repB and repC. The first two genes encode proteins involved in plasmid segregation, whereas repC encodes a protein crucial for replication. The origin of replication maps within the repC gene [[cite:PUB00043441]]. This entry represents the plasmid replication protein RepC, which is rate limiting for pT181 replication and it is likely that pT181 replication is regulated at the level of RepC synthesis [[cite:PUB00106104]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040974" "plasmid replication protein RepC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasmid replication protein RepC", "short" "RepABC_RepC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 502, "taxa" 1980, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3881, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3881, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3195}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047611", :literature {"PUB00106104" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Manch-Citron JN" "Gennaro ML" "Majumder S" "Novick RP."], "ISO_journal" "Plasmid", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plasmid", "title" "RepC is rate limiting for pT181 plasmid replication.", "year" 1986, "raw_pages" "108-15", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3462754}, "PUB00043441" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cevallos MA" "Cervantes-Rivera R" "Gutierrez-Rios RM."], "ISO_journal" "Plasmid", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2008.03.001", "medline_journal" "Plasmid", "title" "The repABC plasmid family.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "19-37", "volume" "60", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18433868}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047611", "name" "Plasmid replication protein RepC", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
