{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins from Actinobacteria includes apoptosis inhibitor Rv3654c. Rv3654c is one of two proteins identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are secreted into the host macrophage cytoplasm to suppress apoptosis by blocking the extrinsic pathway, a mechanism to avoid the host defense. Rv3654c recognizes the polypyrimidine tract binding Protein-associated Splicing Factor (PSF) and cleaves it, diminishing the availability of caspase-8 [[cite:PUB00082561]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03816" "Rv3654c family TadE-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apoptosis inhibitor Rv3654c-like", "short" "Rv3654c-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1425, "taxa" 4198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3919, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3919, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3105}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021202", :literature {"PUB00082561" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Danelishvili L" "Yamazaki Y" "Selker J" "Bermudez LE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010474", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Secreted Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3654c and Rv3655c proteins participate in the suppression of macrophage apoptosis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "e10474", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20454556}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021202", "name" "Apoptosis inhibitor Rv3654c-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
