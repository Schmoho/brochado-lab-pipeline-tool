{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small group of ABC transporter permease subunits found in archaea. Several lines of evidence suggest they are functionally analogous, as well as homologous, to the UrtB subunit of the Corynebacterium glutamicum urea transporter. All members of the operons in which they are encoded show sequence similarity to urea transport subunits, their genes are located near the urease structural subunits in two out of three species, and partial phylogenetic profiling identifies this permease subunit as closely matching the profile of urea utilization.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03622" "urea ABC transporter, permease protein UrtB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, urea permease protein UrtB, archaeal", "short" "ABC_UrtB_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 178, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 107, "sets" 0, "proteins" 107, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 95}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0743", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0743"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019924", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001851", "name" "ABC transporter, permease", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017779", "name" "ABC transporter, urea permease protein UrtB, bacterial-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR019924", "name" "ABC transporter, urea permease protein UrtB, archaeal", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022497", "name" "ABC transporter, urea permease, UrtC", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR043428", "name" "High-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system permease protein LivM-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017778", "name" "ABC transporter, urea, permease protein, UrtC", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR053777", "name" "Galactofuranose transporter permease protein YtfT", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
