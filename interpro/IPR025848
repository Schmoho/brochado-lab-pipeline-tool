{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>METTL3 and METTL14 (methyltransferase-like) form a methyltransferase complex that methylates adenosine residues at the N6 position of some RNAs, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A). METTL3, also known as MT-A70, is the catalytic subunit of this complex, and accepts S-adenosyl methionine, a donor for methylation [[cite:PUB00087330]]. m6A, which is present at internal sites of some mRNAs, affects different aspects of mRNA metabolism such as half-life, splicing, and translation [[cite:PUB00087331], [cite:PUB00087332], [cite:PUB00087333], [cite:PUB00087334], [cite:PUB00087335]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (EC [ec:2.1.1.-]) constitute an important class of enzymes present in every life form.

All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]].
