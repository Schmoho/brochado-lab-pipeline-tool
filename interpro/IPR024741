{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Subunit G2 is a non-SMC subunit of condensin II, which is involved in maintenance of the structural integrity of chromosomes. Condensin II is made up of SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) and non-SMC subunits. The non-SMC subunits bind to the catalytic ends of the SMC subunit dimer. The condensin holocomplex is able to introduce superhelical tension into DNA in an ATP hydrolysis- dependent manner, resulting in the formation of positive supercoils in the presence of topoisomerase I and of positive knots in the presence of topoisomerase II [[cite:PUB00056240]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12422" "Condensin II non structural maintenance of chromosomes subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Condensin-2 complex subunit G2", "short" "Condensin2_G2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 1100, "taxa" 4286, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2144, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2114, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1276}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024741", :literature {"PUB00056240" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ono T" "Losada A" "Hirano M" "Myers MP" "Neuwald AF" "Hirano T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00724-4", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Differential contributions of condensin I and condensin II to mitotic chromosome architecture in vertebrate cells.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "109-21", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14532007}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024741", "name" "Condensin-2 complex subunit G2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 37, "alignment:full" 1355}}}
