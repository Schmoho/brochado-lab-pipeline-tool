{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Paracoccus denitrificans bacteria, amicyanin acts as an intermediary of a three-member redox complex along with methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) and cytochrome c-551i. The electron is transferred from the active site of MADH via the amicyanin copper ion to the cytochrome heme iron. The electron transfer from MADH to cytochrome c-551i does not involve a ternary complex but occurs via a ping-pong mechanism in which amicyanin uses the same interface for the reactions with MADH and cytochrome c-551i [[cite:PUB00085838]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ov0", "name" "Structure of the blue copper protein Amicyanin to 0.75 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13921" "Amicyanin is a type I blue copper protein that plays an essential role in electron transfer"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amicyanin", "short" "Amicyanin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 448, "taxa" 2760, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3061, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3058, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2397}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035668", :literature {"PUB00085838" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Meschi F" "Wiertz F" "Klauss L" "Cavalieri C" "Blok A" "Ludwig B" "Heering HA" "Merli A" "Rossi GL" "Ubbink M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
