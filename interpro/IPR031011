Sequence identity can exceed 96 percent, suggesting recent lateral transfer. These observations suggest the cassette confers resistance to a toxic compound such as an antibiotic.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04472" "radical SAM mobile pair system MarR family transcriptional regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MarR family transcriptional regulator", "short" "Reg_MarR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 80, "taxa" 374, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 337, "sets" 0, "proteins" 337, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 304}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031011", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031011", "name" "MarR family transcriptional regulator", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
