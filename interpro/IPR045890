{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subset of proteins from the Bric-a-Brac/Tramtrack/Broad Complex (BTB) family predominantly found in the plant class Magnoliopsida, including POB1 from Arabidopsis. BTB proteins direct the selective ubiquitylation of proteins following their assembly into Cullin3-based ubiquitin ligases. Proteins in this family contain a BTB (broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac, also known as poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) domain and a BACK (BTB-and-C-terminal-Kelch) domain [[cite:PUB00071372], [cite:PUB00099210]].</p>\n\n<p>POB1 (also known as light-response BTB2, Lrb2) is predicted to be involved in ubiquitination [[cite:PUB00071372], [cite:PUB00099210]] and to negatively regulate the ABA-mediated inhibition of germination [[cite:PUB00099306]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46336" "OS02G0260700 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BTB/POZ domain-containing protein POB1-like", "short" "POB1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 277, "taxa" 1120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2304, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2304, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1332}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045890", :literature {"PUB00071372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Gingerich DJ" "Gagne JM" "Salter DW" "Hellmann H" "Estelle M" "Ma L" "Vierstra RD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
