{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins, approximately 300 residues in length, involved in vesicle transport. They have a single C-terminal transmembrane domain and a SNARE [soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) attachment protein receptor] domain of approximately 60 residues. The SNARE domains are essential for membrane fusion and are conserved from yeasts to humans. Use1 is one of the three protein subunits that make up the SNARE complex and it is specifically required for Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum retrograde transport [[cite:PUB00045165]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09753" "Membrane fusion protein Use1"}, "panther" {"PTHR13050" "USE1-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesicle transport protein, Use1", "short" "Vesicle_transport_protein_Use1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 81, "proteomes" 2326, "taxa" 7893, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4217, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4144, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2677}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019150", :literature {"PUB00045165" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Dilcher M" "Veith B" "Chidambaram S" "Hartmann E" "Schmitt HD" "Fischer von Mollard G."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdg339", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Use1p is a yeast SNARE protein required for retrograde traffic to the ER.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "3664-74", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12853481}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019150", "name" "Vesicle transport protein, Use1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 29, "alignment:full" 2157}}}
