{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the phage-like element PBSX protein from Firmicutes. PBSX protein forms a hole, or portal, that enables DNA passage during packaging and ejection. It also forms the junction between the phage head (capsid) and the tail proteins. It functions as a dodecamer of a single polypeptide of average molecular weight of 40-90kDa.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF019260" "Predicted phage portal protein, PBSX XkdE type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family, Firmicutes", "short" "PBSX_Firmicutes"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 458, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 370, "sets" 0, "proteins" 355, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 176}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016753", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006944", "name" "Bacteriophage/Gene transfer agent portal protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006427", "name" "Phage portal protein, HK97", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006430", "name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016753", "name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family, Firmicutes", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030935", "name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family, Proteobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
