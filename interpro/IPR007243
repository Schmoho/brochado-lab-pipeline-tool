{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In yeasts, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 30 (Vps30), also known as autophagy-related protein 6 (Atg6), is a common component of two distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes. In complex I, Atg14 links Vps30 to Vps34 lipid kinase and plays a specific role in autophagy, while in complex II, Vps38 links Vps30 to Vps34 and plays an important role in vacuolar protein sorting [[cite:PUB00069995]]. The C-terminal of Vps30 contains a globular fold comprised of three β-sheet-α-helix repeats (also known as β-α repeated, autophagy-specific (BARA) domain) and is required for autophagy through the targeting of complex I to the pre-autophagosomal structure. The  N-terminal of Vps30 is required for vacuolar protein sorting [[cite:PUB00069995]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ddp", "name" "crystal structure of Beclin 1 evolutionarily conserved domain(ECD)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038274", "name" "Atg6/Beclin C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12768" "BECLIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Atg6/Beclin", "short" "Atg6/Beclin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2445, "taxa" 8608, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5265, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5265, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3410}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007243", :literature {"PUB00069997" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wirawan E" "Lippens S" "Vanden Berghe T" "Romagnoli A" "Fimia GM" "Piacentini M" "Vandenabeele P."], "ISO_journal" "Autophagy", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/auto.8.1.16645", "medline_journal" "Autophagy", "title" "Beclin1: a role in membrane dynamics and beyond.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "6-17", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22170155}, "PUB00069993" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kang R" "Zeh HJ" "Lotze MT" "Tang D."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Differ.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2010.191", "medline_journal" "Cell Death Differ", "title" "The Beclin 1 network regulates autophagy and apoptosis.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "571-80", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21311563}, "PUB00069995" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Noda NN" "Kobayashi T" "Adachi W" "Fujioka Y" "Ohsumi Y" "Inagaki F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
