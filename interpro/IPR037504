{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Budding yeast Pin2 was identified as a protein that when overexpressed can induce the [PIN+] prion phenotype, which is a prerequisite for prion formation by Sup35, referred to as the [PSI+] prion [[cite:PUB00087077]]. Pin2 localization is dependent on both exo- and endocytosisis. It is an exomer-dependent cargo that localizes at the plasma membrane of the bud early in the cell cycle, and the bud neck at cytokinesis. The prion-like domain (PLD) in Pin2 serves as a Pin2 retention signal in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and may act as stress-response element. Under environmental stress, Pin2 is endocytosed, and the PLD aggregates and causes sequestration of Pin2. This aggregation is reversible upon stress removal and Pin2 can be re-exported to the plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00087076]]. Why Pin2 needs to be retain under stress is not clear, but it may be related to the observation that Pin2 interacts with various components of the cell-wall integrity pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40018" "[PSI+] INDUCTION PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "[PSI+] induction protein 2", "short" "PSI_induc_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 639, "taxa" 1711, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 954, "sets" 0, "proteins" 954, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 617}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037504", :literature {"PUB00087076" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ritz AM" "Trautwein M" "Grassinger F" "Spang A."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.02.026", "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "The prion-like domain in the exomer-dependent cargo Pin2 serves as a trans-Golgi retention motif.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "249-60", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24656818}, "PUB00087077" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Derkatch IL" "Bradley ME" "Hong JY" "Liebman SW."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00427-5", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Prions affect the appearance of other prions: the story of [PIN(+)].", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "171-82", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11511345}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR037504", "name" "[PSI+] induction protein 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
