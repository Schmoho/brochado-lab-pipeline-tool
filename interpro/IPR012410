{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains homologues of nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs). They are designated NDP kinase homologue 5 (NDK-H5), and differ from other NDPKs by having a C-terminal Dpy-30 motif. Despite considerable sequence similarity to other NDPKs, and conservation of seven out of nine known functionally important residues [[cite:PUB00014707], [cite:PUB00014708], [cite:PUB00014706]], human NDK-H5 (nm23-H5) seems to lack NDP kinase activity [[cite:PUB00014707]]. The nature of the sequence features specific to the NDK-H5 as compared to other NDPKs suggests that it may be unable to form hexamers and instead have a dimeric structure, which may affect its catalytic activity.</p>\n\n<p>NDK-H5 is thought to be involved in early stages of spermatogenesis [[cite:PUB00014707]]. Heterologous expression of murine NDK-H5 (nm23-M5) in yeast cells confers protection from cell death induced by Bax, which is due to the generation of reactive oxygen species, and over-expression of nm23-M5 in fibroblasts alters cellular levels of several antioxidant enzymes including Gpx5 [[cite:PUB00014705]]. Therefore, nm23-M5 may play a role in late spermatogenesis by increasing the ability of late-stage spermatids to eliminate reactive oxygen species [[cite:PUB00014705]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036850", "name" "Nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036504" "Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase homologue with Dpy-30 motif (NDK-H5)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase-like NDK-H5", "short" "NDK_H5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 415, "taxa" 1459, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 512, "sets" 0, "proteins" 509, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 364}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012410", :literature {"PUB00014707" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Munier A" "Feral C" "Milon L" "Pinon VP" "Gyapay G" "Capeau J" "Guellaen G" "Lacombe ML."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(98)00996-X", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "A new human nm23 homologue (nm23-H5) specifically expressed in testis germinal cells.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "289-94", "volume" "434", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9742940}, "PUB00014708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Morera S" "Chiadmi M" "LeBras G" "Lascu I" "Janin J."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00035a011", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Mechanism of phosphate transfer by nucleoside diphosphate kinase: X-ray structures of the phosphohistidine intermediate of the enzymes from Drosophila and Dictyostelium.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "11062-70", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7669763}, "PUB00014706" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Morera S" "Lacombe ML" "Xu Y" "LeBras G" "Janin J."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00268-4", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "X-ray structure of human nucleoside diphosphate kinase B complexed with GDP at 2 A resolution.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "1307-14", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8747457}, "PUB00014705" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hwang KC" "Ok DW" "Hong JC" "Kim MO" "Kim JH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
