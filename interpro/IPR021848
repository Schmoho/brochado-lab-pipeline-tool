{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins predominantly found in fungi and bacteria, including the alpha subunit of an haem-dependent oxidative N-demethylase (HODM) from Pseudomonas mendocina (Pmen_3455, [swissprot:A4XXY9]). This protein, catalytically active, is responsible for haem, oxygen and NADPH-dependent dimethylamine (DMA) binding. It shows an N- and C-terminally extended PAS haem binding domain structurally similar to the to the Aer2 PAS domain, but lacks the core PAS-domain α-helix that forms the Aer2 haem pocket, and displays extended β-strands and a longer loop [[cite:PUB00100877]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5lte", "name" "Crystal structure of the alpha subunit of heme dependent oxidative N-demethylase (HODM)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11927" "Haem-dependent oxidative N-demethylase, alpha subunit-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haem-dependent oxidative N-demethylase, alpha subunit-like", "short" "HODM_asu-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 99, "proteomes" 2013, "taxa" 6661, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8948, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8771, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6047}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
