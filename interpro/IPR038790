{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 9 (Med9) from plants [[cite:PUB00078644]]. The Mediator complex is a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. On recruitment the Mediator complex unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNA polymerase II, specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins [[cite:PUB00033372]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37188" "MEDIATOR OF RNA POLYMERASE II TRANSCRIPTION SUBUNIT-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 9, plant", "short" "Med9_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 216, "taxa" 824, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 515, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 320}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038790", :literature {"PUB00033372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bourbon HM" "Aguilera A" "Ansari AZ" "Asturias FJ" "Berk AJ" "Bjorklund S" "Blackwell TK" "Borggrefe T" "Carey M" "Carlson M" "Conaway JW" "Conaway RC" "Emmons SW" "Fondell JD" "Freedman LP" "Fukasawa T" "Gustafsson CM" "Han M" "He X" "Herman PK" "Hinnebusch AG" "Holmberg S" "Holstege FC" "Jaehning JA" "Kim YJ" "Kuras L" "Leutz A" "Lis JT" "Meisterernest M" "Naar AM" "Nasmyth K" "Parvin JD" "Ptashne M" "Reinberg D" "Ronne H" "Sadowski I" "Sakurai H" "Sipiczki M" "Sternberg PW" "Stillman DJ" "Strich R" "Struhl K" "Svejstrup JQ" "Tuck S" "Winston F" "Roeder RG" "Kornberg RD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
