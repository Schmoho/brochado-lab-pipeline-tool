{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Sex Peptides (SP) that are found in Drosophila. On mating, Drosophila females decreases her remating rate and increases her egg-laying rate due, in part, to the transfer of SP from the male to the female. SP are found in seminal fluids transferred from the male to the female during mating. The male seminal fluid proteins are referred to as accessory gland proteins (Acps). The SP is one of the most interesting Acps and plays an important role in reproduction [[cite:PUB00016438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08138" "Sex peptide (SP) family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sex peptide", "short" "Sex_peptide"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012608", :literature {"PUB00016438" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Swanson WJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
