{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase RhgT and related proteins. \r\nRhamnogalacturan acetylesterase removes acetyl esters from rhamnogalacturonan substrates, and renders them susceptible to degradation by rhamnogalacturonases. Rhamnogalacturonans are highly branched regions in pectic polysaccharides, consisting of repeating -(1,2)-L-Rha-(1,4)-D-GalUA disaccharide units, with many rhamnose residues substituted by neutral oligosaccharides such as arabinans, galactans and arabinogalactans. Extracellular enzymes participating in the degradation of plant cell wall polymers, such as Rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase, would typically be found in saprophytic and plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria [[cite:PUB00083821]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1k7c", "name" "Rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase with seven N-linked carbohydrate residues distributed at two N-glycosylation sites refined at 1.12 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036514", "name" "SGNH hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01821" "Rhamnogalacturan_acetylesterase_like"}, "panther" {"PTHR43695" "PUTATIVE (AFU_ORTHOLOGUE AFUA_2G17250)-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase RhgT-like", "short" "RhgT-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1894, "taxa" 6542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11650, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11130, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7685}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
