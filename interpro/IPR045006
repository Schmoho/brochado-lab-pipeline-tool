{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Magnesium-chelatase is a three-component enzyme, consisting of CHLI, CHLD and CHLH subunits, that catalyses the insertion of Mg2 into protoporphyrin IX, the first unique step in the synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll. As a result, Mg-chelatase has an important role in channeling intermediates into the (bacterio)chlorophyll branch in response to conditions suitable for photosynthetic growth [[cite:PUB00000550], [cite:PUB00002318]]. The reaction takes place in two steps including an ATP-dependent activation followed by an ATP-dependent chelation step.</p>\n\n<p>This family represents CHLI subunit (38-42kDa), which possesses high affinity for ATP and play a major role in chlorophyll biosynthesis, as ATP hydrolysis by this subunit is crucial for this reaction and its activity is a determinant of the rate of Mg insertion into the tetrapyrrole ring [[cite:PUB00097705]]. In Arabidopsis there are two CHLI isoforms, CHLI1 and CHLI2, which share similar expression profiles but CHLI2 has a lower ATPase activity than CHLI1 and a limited role in chlorophyll biosynthesis. However, CHLI2 contributes to the assembly of the Mg-chelatase complex [[cite:PUB00091654]]. It does not bind abscisic acid (ABA), but is a positive regulator of ABA signaling [[cite:PUB00091697]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32039" "MAGNESIUM-CHELATASE SUBUNIT CHLI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Magnesium-chelatase subunit ChlI-like", "short" "CHLI-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8252, "taxa" 34687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44264, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44264, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33637}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
