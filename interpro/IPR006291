{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents Transcriptional regulatory protein CusR from Escherichia coli ([[cite:PUB00090187], [cite:PUB00090186]]) and similar sequences predominantly found in proteobacteria. Proteins in this entry contain a response regulator receiver domain ([interpro:IPR001789]) and an associated transcriptional regulatory region ([interpro:IPR001867]). This group is separated phylogenetically from related proteins with similar architecture and contains a number of proteins associated with heavy metal resistance efflux systems for copper, silver, cadmium, and/or zinc. Most members are encoded by genes adjacent to genes which code for a member of the heavy metal sensor histidine kinase family ([interpro:IPR006290]), its partner in the two-component response regulator system.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01387" "heavy metal response regulator transcription factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein CusR-like, heavy metal response", "short" "CusR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 724, "taxa" 4724, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9603, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7575}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006291", :literature {"PUB00090187" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Urano H" "Yoshida M" "Ogawa A" "Yamamoto K" "Ishihama A" "Ogasawara H."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.000410", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Cross-regulation between two common ancestral response regulators, HprR and CusR, in Escherichia coli.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "243-252", "volume" "163", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27983483}, "PUB00090186" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Urano H" "Umezawa Y" "Yamamoto K" "Ishihama A" "Ogasawara H."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.000026", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Cooperative regulation of the common target genes between H₂O₂-sensing YedVW and Cu²⁺-sensing CusSR in Escherichia coli.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "729-38", "volume" "161", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25568260}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039420", "name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein WalR-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006291", "name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein CusR-like, heavy metal response", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011879", "name" "Signal transduction response regulator, phosphate regulon transcriptional regulatory protein PhoB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022305", "name" "Sortase system response regulator", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047671", "name" "MtrAB system response regulator MtrA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047791", "name" "Response regulator WalR", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR049766", "name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein CseB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR049767", "name" "Two-component system response regulator RppA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
