{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of bacterial type III secretion system proteins which share a conserved C-terminal domain. These proteins are designated YscI (Yop proteins translocation protein I) in Yersinia and HrpB (hypersensitivity response and pathogenicity protein B) in plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae. This entry also includes PscI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
