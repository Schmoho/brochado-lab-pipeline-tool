{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These splicing factors consist of an N-terminal arginine-rich low complexity domain followed by three tandem RNA recognition motifs. The well-characterised members of this family are auxilliary components of the U2 small nuclear ribonuclearprotein splicing factor (U2AF). These proteins are closely related to the CC1-like subfamily of splicing factors ([interpro:IPR006509]). Members of this subfamily are found in plants, metazoa and fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ev3", "name" "Structure III of Intact U2AF65 Recognizing the 3' Splice Site Signal"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01642" "U2 snRNP auxilliary factor, large subunit, splicing factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "U2 snRNP auxilliary factor, large subunit, splicing factor", "short" "U2AF_lg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1918, "taxa" 6733, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5176, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3128}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006529", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006397", "name" "mRNA processing", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006529", "name" "U2 snRNP auxilliary factor, large subunit, splicing factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
