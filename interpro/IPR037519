{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LITAF (LPS-induced TNF-activating factor) (also known as SIMPLE; small integral membrane protein of the late endosome) is an endosome-associated integral membrane protein important for multivesicular body (MVB) sorting. It is a monotypic membrane protein with both termini exposed to the cytoplasm and is anchored to membranes via an in-plane helical membrane anchor, present within the highly conserved C-terminal region known as the 'LITAF domain' or 'SIMPLE-like domain'. The LITAF domain consists of conserved cysteines separated by a 22 residue hydrophobic region. LITAF domains are found throughout the eukaryotes, suggesting ancient conserved functions, with multiple instances of expansion, especially in the metazoa [[cite:PUB00087092], [cite:PUB00087093]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Proteins containing the LITAF domain include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Vertebrate lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF).
