{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>[Citrate (pro-3S)-lyase] ligase ([ec:6.2.1.22]), also known as citrate lyase ligase, is responsible for acetylation of the prosthetic group (2-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephosphocoenzyme-A) of the gamma subunit of citrate lyase. It converts the inactive thiol form of the enzyme to the active form. In Clostridium sphenoides, citrate lyase ligase actively degrades citrate. In Clostridium sporosphaeroides and Lactococcus lactis, however, the enzyme is under stringent regulatory control. The enzyme's activity in anaerobic bacteria is modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation [[cite:PUB00044603]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02169" "Citrate lyase ligase"}, "panther" {"PTHR40599" "[CITRATE [PRO-3S]-LYASE] LIGASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005751" "Citrate lyase ligase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00124" "[citrate (pro-3S)-lyase] ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate lyase ligase", "short" "Citrate_lyase_ligase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 524, "taxa" 3089, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3711, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3700, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2959}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0672"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
