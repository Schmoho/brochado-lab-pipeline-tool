The SARS-CoV ORF7b protein is a 44 amino acid protein which is homologous to an accessory but structural component of SARS-CoV virion. While ORF7b is packaged into virions, it is not required for the virus budding process, as gene 7 deletion viruses replicate efficiently in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ORF7b possesses a transmembrane helical domain (TMD), between 9-29 amino acid residues, is necessary for its Golgi complex localization, as replacing it with the TMD from the human endoprotease furin results in aberrant localization [[cite:PUB00094108], [cite:PUB00094109]].</p>\n\n<p>ORF7b from SARS-CoV-2 is a 43 amino acid protein localized in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and it has been shown to induce apoptosis. It promotes expression of IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, and activation of type-I IFN signaling through IRF3 phosphorylation and to activate TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells and Vero E6 cells [[cite:PUB00101797], [cite:PUB00101796]]. These recent findings suggest a mechanism to understand pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of its accessory proteins in modulating host immune responses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11395" "Betacoronavirus NS7B protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Structural accessory protein ORF7b, betacoronavirus", "short" "NS7B_bCoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 206, "sets" 0, "proteins" 206, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021532", :literature {"PUB00101796" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang J" "Cruz-Cosme R" "Zhuang MW" "Liu D" "Liu Y" "Teng S" "Wang PH" "Tang Q."], "ISO_journal" "Signal Transduct Target Ther", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Signal Transduct Target Ther", "title" "A systemic and molecular study of subcellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "269", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33203855}, "PUB00101797" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yang R" "Zhao Q" "Rao J" "Zeng F" "Yuan S" "Ji M" "Sun X" "Li J" "Yang J" "Cui J" "Jin Z" "Liu L" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "SARS-CoV-2 Accessory Protein ORF7b Mediates Tumor Necrosis Factor-Î±-Induced Apoptosis in Cells.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "654709", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34484133}, "PUB00094108" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Schaecher SR" "Mackenzie JM" "Pekosz A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
