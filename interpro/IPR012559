{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of erythromycin resistance gene leader peptides. These leader peptides are involved in the transcriptional attenuation control of the synthesis of the macrolide-lincosamide -streptogramin B resistance protein. It acts as a transcriptional attenuator, in contrast to other inducible erm genes. The mRNA leader sequence can fold in either of two mutually exclusive conformations, one of which is postulated to form in the absence of induction, and to contain two rho factor-independent terminators [[cite:PUB00016534]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08057" "Erythromycin resistance leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Erythromycin resistance leader peptide-2", "short" "Emycin-R_leader_pep2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 50, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012559", :literature {"PUB00016534" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Kwak JH" "Choi EC" "Weisblum B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
