{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences represent 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase/3'-nucleotidases; it is a bifunctional enzyme localized to the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesters are intermediates formed during the hydrolysis of RNA by the ribonuclease I, which is also found in the periplasm, and other enzymes of the RNAse T2 family. Bacteria are unable to transport 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotides into the cytoplasm. 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase/3'-nucleotidases contains 2 active sites which catalyze the reactions that convert the 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide into a 3'-nucleotide, which is then converted into nucleic acid and phosphate. Both final products can be transported into the cytoplasm. Thus, it has been suggested that 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase/3'-nucleotidases have a scavenging function. Experimental evidence indicates that a 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase/3'-nucleotidase enables Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 to grow on 23-cAMP as a sole source of carbon and energy [[cite:PUB00009537]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01390" "2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase/3'-nucleotidase", "short" "Cyc_nuc_PDE_nucleotidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 234, "taxa" 1814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2415, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1872}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
