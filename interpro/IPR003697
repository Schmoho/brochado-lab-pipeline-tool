{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Maf protein of Bacillus subtilis shares substantial amino acid sequence identity with Escherichia coli YhdE (previously known as OrfE) [[cite:PUB00008179]]. Maf-like proteins are conserved in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Maf proteins have been implicated in cell division arrest [[cite:PUB00083351]]. It has also been proposed that they belong to a family of house-cleaning nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymes which prevent the incorporation of noncanonical nucleotides into cellular DNA [[cite:PUB00079689]]. Maf proteins exhibit nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity against canonical and modified nucleotides, which might represent a molecular mechanism for this dual role in cell division arrest and in house-cleaning [[cite:PUB00083350]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry includes pyrophosphatases, such as YhdE and YceF from E. coli. YhdE is a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes dTTP and UTP [[cite:PUB00083350], [cite:PUB00092592], [cite:PUB00092593]]. YceF is a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes 7-methyl-GTP (m7GTP) [[cite:PUB00092594]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ex2", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS MAF PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029001", "name" "Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00555" "Maf"}, "panther" {"PTHR43213" "BIFUNCTIONAL DTTP/UTP PYROPHOSPHATASE/METHYLTRANSFERASE PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "hamap" {"MF_00528" "dTTP/UTP pyrophosphatase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006305" "Predicted septum formation protein Maf"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00172" "Maf family nucleotide pyrophosphatase"}, "pfam" {"PF02545" "Maf-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase Maf-like protein", "short" "Maf-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 181, "proteomes" 11064, "taxa" 41376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57657, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57602, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 43241}, "pathways" 158}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
