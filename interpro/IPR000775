{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bindin, the major protein component of the acrosome granule of sea urchin sperm, mediates species-specific adhesion of sperm to the egg surface during fertilisation [[cite:PUB00001098], [cite:PUB00003633]]. The protein coats the acrosomal process after externalisation by the acrosome reaction; it binds to sulphated, fucose-containing polysaccharides on the vitelline-layer receptor proteoglycans that cover the egg plasma membrane. Bindins from different genera show high levels of sequence similarity in both the mature bindin domain and in the probindin precursor region. The most highly conserved region is a 42-residue segment in the central portion of the mature bindin protein. This domain may be responsible for conserved functions of bindin, while the more highly divergent flanking regions may be responsible for its species-specific properties [[cite:PUB00001098]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00761" "BINDIN"}, "pfam" {"PF02084" "Bindin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bindin", "short" "Bindin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 783, "sets" 0, "proteins" 639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 538}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000775", :literature {"PUB00001098" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Glabe CG" "Clark D."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
