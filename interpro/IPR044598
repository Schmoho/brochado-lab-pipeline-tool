{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ZCRB1 is a novel multi-functional nuclear factor that may be involved in morphine dependence, cold/heat stress, and hepatocarcinoma. It is located in the nucleoplasm, but outside the nucleolus [[cite:PUB00082899]]. ZCRB1 is one of the components of U11/U12 snRNPs that bind to U12-type pre-mRNAs and form a di-snRNP complex, simultaneously recognizing the 5' splice site and branchpoint sequence [[cite:PUB00082764], [cite:PUB00082900]]. ZCRB1 is characterised by an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and a CCHC-type zinc finger motif. In addition, it contains core nucleocapsid motifs, and Lys- and Glu-rich domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46259" "ZINC FINGER CCHC-TYPE AND RNA-BINDING MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif-containing protein 1", "short" "ZCRB1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1060, "taxa" 4194, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1978, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1978, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1268}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044598", :literature {"PUB00082764" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Will CL" "Schneider C" "Hossbach M" "Urlaub H" "Rauhut R" "Elbashir S" "Tuschl T" "Luhrmann R."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1261/rna.7320604", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "The human 18S U11/U12 snRNP contains a set of novel proteins not found in the U2-dependent spliceosome.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "929-41", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15146077}, "PUB00082899" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang H" "Gao MX" "Li L" "Wang B" "Hori N" "Sato K."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.07.009", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Isolation, expression, and characterization of the human ZCRB1 gene mapped to 12q12.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "59-69", "volume" "89", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16959469}, "PUB00082900" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kim WY" "Jung HJ" "Kwak KJ" "Kim MK" "Oh SH" "Han YS" "Kang H."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.110.079103", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The Arabidopsis U12-type spliceosomal protein U11/U12-31K is involved in U12 intron splicing via RNA chaperone activity and affects plant development.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "3951-62", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21148817}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000398", "name" "mRNA splicing, via spliceosome", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005689", "name" "U12-type spliceosomal complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044598", "name" "Zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif-containing protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
