The active site is found at the interface of all three domains. Catalysis occurs by a two-step reaction. In the first step, flavin is reduced by NADPH. Subsequently, the reduced flavin is oxygenated to a hydroperoxide which transfers the hydroxyl group to the substrate, forming 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1k0i", "name" "Pseudomonas aeruginosa phbh R220Q in complex with 100mM PHB"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02360" "4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase", "short" "HB_mOase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 39, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1085, "taxa" 4757, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4970, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4970, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3835}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
