{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family highly conserved in some Firmicutes have an N-terminal radical SAM domain ([interpro:IPR007197]) and a C-terminal domain ([interpro:IPR014866]) with a CxCxxxxC motif that suggests binding to an additional metallocluster. It appears all correct sequences in this family are about 370 amino acids in length, containing the YfkA and YfkB regions originally reported as separate ORFs in Bacillus subtilis. Partial Phylogenetic Profiling shows occurrences almost exclusively in the Bacilli, with very few examples of either lateral transfer or gene loss. The essentially monophyletic distribution suggests a housekeeping function. Members have no well-conserved gene neighbourhood. The function is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01097" "Uncharacterised Radical SAM Subgroup 10"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04478" "radical SAM/CxCxxxxC motif protein YfkAB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radical SAM/CxCxxxxC motif protein YfkAB", "short" "rSAM_YfkAB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 466, "taxa" 1477, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1427, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1426, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1071}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031004", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031004", "name" "Radical SAM/CxCxxxxC motif protein YfkAB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
