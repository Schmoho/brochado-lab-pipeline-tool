{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents family III CoA-transferases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>CoA-transferases are found in organisms from all kingdoms of life. They catalyse reversible transfer reactions of coenzyme A groups from CoA-thioesters to free acids. There are at least three families of CoA-transferases, which differ in sequence and reaction mechanism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Family I consists of CoA-transferases for 3-oxoacids ([ec:2.8.3.5], [ec:2.8.3.6]), short-chain fatty acids ([ec:2.8.3.8], [ec:2.8.3.9]) and glutaconate ([ec:2.8.3.12]). Most use succinyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA as CoA donors.</li>\n<li>Family II consists of the homodimeric alpha-subunits of citrate lyase and citramalate lyase ([ec:2.8.3.10], [ec:2.8.3.11]). These enzymes catalyse the transfer of acyl carrier protein (ACP) with a covalently bound CoA derivative, but can accept free CoA thioesters as well.</li>\n<li>Family III consists of formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00031320]], succinyl-CoA:(R)-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00035619]], (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA:(R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00035620]], succinyl-CoA:mesaconate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00093662]] and butyrobetainyl-CoA:(R)-carnitine CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00032440]]. These CoA-transferases occur in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and catalyse CoA-transfer reactions in a highly substrate-and stereo-specific manner [[cite:PUB00019325]].</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ed9", "name" "Crystal structure of a CAIB/BAIF family protein from Brucella suis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023606", "name" "CoA-transferase family III domain 1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR044855", "name" "CoA-transferase family III domain 3 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02515" "CoA-transferase family III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CoA-transferase family III", "short" "CoA-Trfase_fam_III"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 49, "domain_architectures" 415, "proteomes" 7560, "taxa" 27593, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 156606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 147496, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 109008}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1572", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1572"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
