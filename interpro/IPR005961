{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the large, tetrameric form of phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH; [ec:1.14.16.1]), as found in metazoans. PAH irreversibly converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, and is known to be the rate-limiting step in phenylalanine catabolism in some systems. It is closely related to metazoan tyrosine 3-monooxygenase and tryptophan 5-monoxygenase, and more distantly to monomeric phenylalanine-4-hydroxylases of some Gram-negative bacteria.   The member of this family from Drosophila has been described as having both phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase and tryptophan 5-monoxygenase activity [[cite:PUB00007916]].  However, a Drosophila member of the tryptophan 5-monoxygenase clade has subsequently been discovered.</p>\r\n<p>A deficiency in PAH can lead to phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterised by an inability to metabolise phenylalanine, resulting in elevated Phe levels in the bloodstream that can lead to mental retardation if left untreated [[cite:PUB00035861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hpo", "name" "Crystallographic structure of the catalytic domain of Human Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (hPAH CD) in complex with iron at 1.6 Angstrom"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036951", "name" "Aromatic amino acid hydroxylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036329", "name" "Aromatic amino acid monoxygenase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01268" "phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase, tetrameric form", "short" "Phe-4-hydroxylase_tetra"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 796, "taxa" 3351, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1659, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1013}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1679", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1679"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
