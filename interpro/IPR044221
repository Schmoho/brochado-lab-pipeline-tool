{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including DYAD from Arabidopsis and AMEIOTIC 1 from Zea mays (AM1) and Oryza sativa (OsAM1). DYAD, also known as SWITCH1, is required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and for bivalent formation at meiosis [[cite:PUB00095516]]. It may also be required for meiotic recombination initiation [[cite:PUB00095517]]. AM1 plays an important role in multiple early meiotic processes and may be required for the initiation of meiosis [[cite:PUB00095518]]. OsAM1 has a coiled-coil domain in its central region, it is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition step in meiocytes and plays an important role in the building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis [[cite:PUB00095623]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46740" "PROTEIN DYAD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein DYAD/AMEIOTIC 1", "short" "DYAD/AMEIOTIC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 253, "taxa" 1064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1088, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 661}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044221", :literature {"PUB00095623" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Che L" "Tang D" "Wang K" "Wang M" "Zhu K" "Yu H" "Gu M" "Cheng Z."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "654-65", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21221128}, "PUB00095516" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Mercier R" "Vezon D" "Bullier E" "Motamayor JC" "Sellier A" "Lefevre F" "Pelletier G" "Horlow C."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "SWITCH1 (SWI1): a novel protein required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and for bivalent formation at meiosis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1859-71", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11459834}, "PUB00095517" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Mercier R" "Armstrong SJ" "Horlow C" "Jackson NP" "Makaroff CA" "Vezon D" "Pelletier G" "Jones GH" "Franklin FC."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "The meiotic protein SWI1 is required for axial element formation and recombination initiation in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "3309-18", "volume" "130", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12783800}, "PUB00095518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Pawlowski WP" "Wang CJ" "Golubovskaya IN" "Szymaniak JM" "Shi L" "Hamant O" "Zhu T" "Harper L" "Sheridan WF" "Cande WZ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Maize AMEIOTIC1 is essential for multiple early meiotic processes and likely required for the initiation of meiosis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3603-8", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19204280}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007131", "name" "reciprocal meiotic recombination", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051177", "name" "meiotic sister chromatid cohesion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051321", "name" "meiotic cell cycle", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044221", "name" "Protein DYAD/AMEIOTIC 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
