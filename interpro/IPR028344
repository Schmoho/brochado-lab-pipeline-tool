{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ParE is encoded from the toxin-antitoxin (TA) gene cassettes parDE, which is widely distributed across bacteria, archaea and bacteriophage. Several parDE operons have been detected in bacteria such as Caulobacter crescentus [[cite:PUB00068089]]. This entry represents toxins ParE1 and ParE4.</p>\r\n<p>ParE shares protein sequence homology with RelE, but has different function. ParE is involved in plasmid partition and acts by inhibiting DNA gyrase, converting supercoiled plasmid DNA into a singly cleaved linear form in an ATP-dependent fashion [[cite:PUB00057357], [cite:PUB00057358]]. ParE1 functions to inhibit cell division but not cell growth. The residues at its C terminus are critical for its stability and toxicity [[cite:PUB00068089]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ycs", "name" "Heterotetramer of Antitoxin PrpA together with Toxin PrpT from Pseudoalteromonas rubra"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035093", "name" "Toxin-antitoxin system, RelE/ParE toxin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF029218" "Toxin-antitoxin system, toxin component ParE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin-antitoxin system, toxin component ParE1/4", "short" "ParE1/4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 873, "taxa" 4430, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4022, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4021, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3126}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028344", :literature {"PUB00068089" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Fiebig A" "Castro Rojas CM" "Siegal-Gaskins D" "Crosson S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
