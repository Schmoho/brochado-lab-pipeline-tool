{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA is the biological information that instructs cells how to exist in an ordered fashion: accurate replication is thus one of the most important events in the life cycle of a cell. This function is performed by DNA- directed DNA-polymerases ([ec:2.7.7.7]) by adding nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) residues to the 5'-end of the growing chain of DNA, using a complementary DNA chain as a template. Small RNA molecules are generally used as primers for chain elongation, although terminal proteins may also be used for the<i>de novo</i>synthesis of a DNA chain. Even though there are 2 different methods of priming, these are mediated by 2 very similar polymerases classes, A and B, with similar methods of chain elongation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2py5", "name" "Phi29 DNA polymerase complexed with single-stranded DNA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00486" "DNA polymerase type-B family"}, "prints" {"PR00106" "DNAPOLB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed DNA polymerase, family B", "short" "DNA-dir_DNA_pol_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 337, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4435, "taxa" 21562, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44733, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38102, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13987}, "pathways" 140}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00107", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00107"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
