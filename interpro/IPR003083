{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>S-crystallins of cephalopod are the major protein constituent of the lens in cephalopods. Their primary protein sequences show a high degree (41%) of identity with the cephalopod digestive gland sigma-class glutathione transferase (GST). In spite of the sequence similarity, lens S-crystallin shows little if any GST activity. S-crystallins fail to bind to an S-hexylglutathione affinity column (marker for glutathione affinity) and have very little GST activity in a typical substitution reaction with glutathione and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene [[cite:PUB00006499]]. Nevertheless, pH rate profiles indicate that any reactions that do take place proceed via the same mechanism as GSTs [[cite:PUB00006357]]. Sequence analysis suggests that the S-crystallins arose from gene duplication of a cephalopod sigma-class GST [[cite:PUB00043616]].</p>\n\n<p>The three-dimensional structure of the sigma-class GST from squid has been determined to 2.4A resolution [[cite:PUB00006320]]. The protein is characterised by two domains, one of which has a 3-layer(aba) sandwich architecture, the other being largely helical. The modelled S-crystallin structure has a similar topology to the squid sigma-class GST, with longer helices 4 and 5, corresponding to a long insertion. The insertion causes the active centre to be in a more closed conformation than sigma-class GSTs and may explain the low affinity for glutathione [[cite:PUB00006499]].</p>\n\n<p>The function of glutathione S-transferases (GST) is the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles. The isoenzymes appear to play a central role in the parasite detoxification system. Glutathione S-transferases form homodimers, but in eukaryotes can also form heterodimers of the A1 and A2 or YC1 and YC2 subunits. The GST domain is also found in S-crystallins from squid, and proteins with no known GST activity, such as eukaryotic elongation factors 1-gamma and the HSP26 family of stress-related proteins, which include auxin-regulated proteins in plants and stringent starvation proteins in Escherichia coli.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036282", "name" "Glutathione S-transferase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01269" "SCRYSTALLIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-crystallin", "short" "S-crystallin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 393, "sets" 0, "proteins" 105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
