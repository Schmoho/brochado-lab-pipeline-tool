{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gp64 is the major envelope fusion glycoprotein in some, though not all, baculoviruses [[cite:PUB00034717], [cite:PUB00034715]]. It is found on the surface of both infected cells and budded virions as a homotrimer, and by determining the viral receptor preferences it defines the host range and infection efficiency. Baculovirus enters its host cells by endocytosis followed by a low-pH-induced fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, allowing viral entrance into the cell cytoplasm. This membrane fusion, and also the efficient budding of virions from the infected cell, is dependent on Gp64. Gp75 is a homologous envelope glycoprotein from Thogotoviruses that, like Gp64, forms homotrimers and is involved in both binding and entering the host cell [[cite:PUB00034716]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03273" "Baculovirus gp64 envelope glycoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baculovirus Gp64, envelope glycoprotein", "short" "Baculovirus_Gp64"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 236, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 204, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004955", :literature {"PUB00034715" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Okano K" "Vanarsdall AL" "Mikhailov VS" "Rohrmann GF."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2005.09.019", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Conserved molecular systems of the Baculoviridae.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "77-87", "volume" "344", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16364739}, "PUB00034716" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Portela A" "Jones LD" "Nuttall P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
