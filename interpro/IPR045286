{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant F-box proteins, including  AT1G61340 (FBS1) , AT4G21510 (FBS2/F-box protein SKIP27),  AT4G05010 (FBS3) and AT4G35930 (FBS4) from Arabidopsis. AtFBS1 has been shown to interact with ASK1, the component of the SCF complex that binds the F-box. AtFBS1 and AtFBS3 are induced in response to osmotic stress, hormone treatment or A. brassicicola infection [[cite:PUB00098474]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34049" "F-BOX PROTEIN SKIP27"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F-box protein FBS1-like", "short" "FBS1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 251, "taxa" 1017, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 917}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045286", :literature {"PUB00098474" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Maldonado-Calderon MT" "Sepulveda-Garcia E" "Rocha-Sosa M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Sci", "title" "Characterization of novel F-box proteins in plants induced by biotic and abiotic stress.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "208-17", "volume" "185-186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22325883}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045286", "name" "F-box protein FBS1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
