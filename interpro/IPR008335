{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of different eukaryotic oxidoreductases that require and bind a molybdopterin cofactor have been shown [[cite:PUB00000608]] to share a few regions of sequence similarity. These enzymes include xanthine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.204]), aldehyde oxidase ([ec:1.2.3.1]), nitrate reductase ([ec:1.7.1.1]), and sulphite oxidase ([ec:1.8.3.1]). The multidomain redox enzyme NAD(P)H:nitrate reductase (NR) catalyses the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in a single polypeptide electron transport chain with electron flow from NAD(P)H-FAD-cytochrome b5-molybdopterin-NO(3). Three forms of NR are known, an NADH-specific enzyme found in higher plants and algae ([ec:1.7.1.1]); an NAD(P)H-bispecific enzyme found in higher plants, algae and fungi ([ec:1.7.1.2]); and an NADPH-specific enzyme found only in fungi ([ec:1.7.1.3]) [[cite:PUB00005356]]. The mitochondrial enzyme sulphite oxidase (sulphite:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase; [ec:1.8.2.1]) catalyses oxidation of sulphite to sulphate, using cytochrome c as the physiological electron acceptor. Sulphite oxidase consists of two structure/function domains, an N-terminal haem domain, similar to cytochrome b5; and a C-terminal molybdopterin domain [[cite:PUB00002526]].</p>\n\n<p>Despite functional parallels, members of the family show no sequence similarity to the C-terminal molybdopterin domain of xanthine dehydrogenase, although xanthine dehydrogenase, nitrate reductases and sulphite oxidase all contain the eukaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductases signature. Sequence comparison suggests that only a single Cys residue (Cys186 in chicken sulphite oxidase), is invariant in all these enzymes, indicating that it may play a role in binding molybdopterin to the protein [[cite:PUB00002593], [cite:PUB00002947]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2a9d", "name" "Crystal structure of recombinant chicken sulfite oxidase with Arg at residue 161"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014756", "name" "Immunoglobulin E-set", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036374", "name" "Oxidoreductase, molybdopterin-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00407" "EUMOPTERIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Eukaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductase", "short" "Mopterin_OxRdtase_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4720, "taxa" 18011, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 189675, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24685, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17997}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
