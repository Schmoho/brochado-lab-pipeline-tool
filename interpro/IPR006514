{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes IRREGULAR XYLEM IRX15/IRX15L, glucuronoxylan 4-O-methyltransferases 1(GXM1), 2(GXM2) and 3(GXM3) from plants. GXMs and IRX15/15L are all expressed in secondary wall-forming cells and they are all involved in xylan biosynthesis. However, they have different functions [[cite:PUB00076853]]. GXM1/GXM2/GXM3 are methyltransferases catalysing 4-O-methylation of GlcA side chains on xylan [[cite:PUB00076852], [cite:PUB00076853]]. IRX15/IRX15L are required for xylan biosynthesis and/or xylan deposition, although their precise enzymatic activity is unknown [[cite:PUB00103824]]. This entry also includes arabinogalactan O-methyltransferase 1  AGM1 (also known as probable methyltransferase At1g27930) and arabinogalactan O-methyltransferase 2 AGM2 (At1g67330) which are required for 4-O-methylation of glucuronic acid of arabinogalactan proteins, a different plant cell wall component [[cite:PUB00103824]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21729" "IRX15/IRX15L/GXM"}, "panther" {"PTHR31444" "OS11G0490100 PROTEIN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01627" "TIGR01627 domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IRX15/GXM/AGM", "short" "IRX15/GXM/AGM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 47, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1243, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3797, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3715, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2235}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
