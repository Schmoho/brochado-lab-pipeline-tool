{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family members are 56-59 residue mu-diguetoxin-1 and beta-diguetoxin-1 toxins, which have been isolated from the weaving spider, Diguetia canities. These toxins were isolated as a result of their potent insect paralytic activities, and designated beta-DGTX-Dc1a, mu-DGTX-Dc1b and mu-DGTX-Dc1c (formerly DTX9.2, DTX11 and DTX12) [[cite:PUB00085296]]. Diguetoxin-Dc1a (Dc1a) has been structurally characterised and shown to have disulfide bonds which form a classical inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) motif in which the Cys13-Cys26 and Cys20-Cys40 disulfide bonds and the intervening sections of the polypeptide backbone form a 23-residue ring that is pierced by the Cys25-Cys54 disulfide bond. This ICK motif is commonly found in spider toxins, and this particular scaffold provides these peptides (so-called knottins) with an unusually high degree of chemical, thermal and biological stability. Dc1a contains an additional disulfide bond (Cys42-Cys52) that appears to serve as a molecular staple which limits the flexibility of a disordered serine-rich hairpin loop. The extended N terminus of Dc1a along with an unusually large loop between Cys26 and Cys40 enables the formation of an N-terminal three-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet that is not found in any other knottin. The molecular surface of Dc1a contains a relatively uniform distribution of charged residues; moreover, there are no distinct clusters of hydrophobic residues that might mediate an interaction with lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00085297]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17491" "Spider Toxins mu-diguetoxin-1 a, b and c"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta/Mu-diguetoxin-1", "short" "Beta/Mu-DGTX-Dc1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 20, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035290", :literature {"PUB00085296" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Windley MJ" "Herzig V" "Dziemborowicz SA" "Hardy MC" "King GF" "Nicholson GM."], "ISO_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins4030191", "medline_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "title" "Spider-venom peptides as bioinsecticides.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "191-227", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22741062}, "PUB00085297" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Bende NS" "Dziemborowicz S" "Mobli M" "Herzig V" "Gilchrist J" "Wagner J" "Nicholson GM" "King GF" "Bosmans F."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5350", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "A distinct sodium channel voltage-sensor locus determines insect selectivity of the spider toxin Dc1a.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "4350", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25014760}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035290", "name" "Beta/Mu-diguetoxin-1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
