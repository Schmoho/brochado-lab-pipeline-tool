{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Torsin-1A-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (TOIP 1/2) also known as LAP1 proteins (Lamina-associated polypeptide 1), which are type 2 integral membrane proteins with a single membrane-spanning region of the inner nuclear membrane [[cite:PUB00011363], [cite:PUB00098431], [cite:PUB00098432]]. These proteins interact with and activate Torsin A, an AAA+ ATPase localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), through a perinuclear domain and forms a heterohexameric (LAP1-Torsin)3 ring that targets Torsin to the nuclear envelope. LAP1 has an atypical AAA+ fold and provides an arginine finger to the Torsin A active site to promote its ATPase activity [[cite:PUB00098431], [cite:PUB00098432]]. A single mutation in Torsin A causes early onset primary dystonia, a painful and severely disabling neuromuscular disease [[cite:PUB00098431], [cite:PUB00098432]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4tvs", "name" "LAP1(aa356-583), H.sapiens, bound to VHH-BS1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038599", "name" "LAP1C-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18843" "TORSIN-1A-INTERACTING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Torsin-1A-interacting protein 1/2", "short" "TOIP1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 865, "taxa" 3489, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2607, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1694}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008662", :literature {"PUB00011363" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kondo Y" "Kondoh J" "Hayashi D" "Ban T" "Takagi M" "Kamei Y" "Tsuji L" "Kim J" "Yoneda Y."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
