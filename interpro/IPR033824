{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the D-aminopeptidase dipeptide-binding protein (dppA; DAP dppA; MEROPS identifier M55.001). Peptide transport systems are found in many bacterial species and generally function to accumulate intact peptides in the cell, where they are hydrolyzed [[cite:PUB00013606]]. The dipeptide-binding protein (dppA) of Bacillus subtilis belongs to the dipeptide ABC transport (dpp) operon expressed early during sporulation. It is a binuclear zinc-dependent, D-specific aminopeptidase. The biologically active enzyme is a homodecamer with active sites buried in its channel. These self-compartmentalizing proteases are characterized by a SXDXEG motif [[cite:PUB00008717]]. D-Ala-D-Ala and D-Ala-Gly-Gly are the preferred substrates [[cite:PUB00013606]]. Bacillus subtilis dppA is thought to function as an adaptation to nutrient deficiency; hydrolysis of its substrate releases D-Ala which can be used subsequently as metabolic fuel [[cite:PUB00013607]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036177", "name" "Peptidase M55, D-aminopeptidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027476", "name" "D-aminopeptidase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00281" "Peptidase M55, D-aminopeptidase dipeptide-binding protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-aminopeptidase DppA", "short" "DppA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 36, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
