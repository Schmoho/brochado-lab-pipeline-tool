{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ABCE family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and solely comprises of the ABCE1 gene product  (also known as RNase L inhibitor, RLI1) [[cite:PUB00009822], [cite:PUB00013904], [cite:PUB00017270]]. RLI1 contains 2 nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) typical of the ABC transporter protein superfamily [[cite:PUB00009822]]; however, it lacks the transmembrane domains required for membrane transport functions [[cite:PUB00009822], [cite:PUB00013904]]. RLI1 was first identified as an endoribonuclease inhibitor that interacts directly with RNase L to prevent it from binding 2-5A (5'-phosphorylated 2',5'-linked oligo-adenylates) [[cite:PUB00009822]]. RNase L plays a major role in the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activities of interferons, and its inhibition by RLI1 occurs in a concentration-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00009822], [cite:PUB00009821]].  Recently, RLI1 has been shown to be essential for the assembly of immature HIV-1 capsids in insect cells and higher eukaryotic cell types [[cite:PUB00017270]]. RLI1 expression is induced during HIV type I infection, and is understood to bind HIV-1 Gag (p55) polypeptides following their translation, and to promote their assembly into immature HIV-1 capsids [[cite:PUB00009822], [cite:PUB00017270], [cite:PUB00017243]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yqt", "name" "RNase-L Inhibitor"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19248" "ATP-BINDING TRANSPORT PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR01868" "ABC transporter, ABCE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RLI1", "short" "RLI1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2999, "taxa" 14307, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 2, "matches" 12180, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10629, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7131}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
