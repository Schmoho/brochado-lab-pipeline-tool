{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Structural analysis predicts that this family of proteins are bacterial transglutaminase-like cysteine peptidases (BTLCPs) with an invariant Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad and an N-terminal signal sequence.  They are predicted to possess the papain-like cysteine proteinase fold and catalyse post-translational protein modification through transamidase, acetylase or hydrolase activity. Inspection of neighbouring genes suggests a link between this predicted activity and a type-I secretion system resembling ATP-binding cassette exporters of toxins and proteases involved in bacterial pathogenicity [[cite:PUB00015047]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4fgq", "name" "Legionella pneumophila LapG"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39327" "PTHR39327"}, "pfam" {"PF06035" "Bacterial transglutaminase-like cysteine proteinase BTLCP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transglutaminase-like cysteine peptidase, predicted", "short" "Transglutaminase-like_Cys_pept"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 1314, "taxa" 6348, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10260, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10258, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8082}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010319", :literature {"PUB00015047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Ginalski K" "Kinch L" "Rychlewski L" "Grishin NV."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
