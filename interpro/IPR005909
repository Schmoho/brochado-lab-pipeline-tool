{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of archaeal radical SAM enzymes (RaSEA) which are involved in the synthesis of archaeosine, a modified nucleoside present in the dihydrouridine loop (D-loop) of archaeal tRNAs. RaSEA forms a robust complex with archaeosine synthase (ArcS) to catalyse the cleavage of the C(epsilon)-N bond of the lysine moiety of q0kN15-tRNA, leading to the formation of archaeosine. RaSEA enzymes have a conserved CX3CX2C motif, in which the three cysteine residues coordinate three of the four iron atoms of the [4Fe-4S] cluster at the active site of the enzyme. It has been demonstrated that the formation of an ArcS-RaSEA complex is crucial for archaeosine formation, following this discovery ArcS has been renamed archaeosine synthase subunit alpha (lysine transferase), and RaSEA has been renamed archaeosine synthase subunit beta (q0kN-tRNA lyase) [[cite:PUB00094213]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004954" "Uncharacterised protein with radical SAM domain"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01210" "archaeosine biosynthesis radical SAM protein RaSEA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Archaeosine synthase subunit beta", "short" "RaSEA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 281, "taxa" 2063, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2085, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2066, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1681}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
