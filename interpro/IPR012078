{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents the hydroxylase component of aromatic and alkene monooxygenases such as methane monooxygenase ([ec:1.14.13.25]) phenol 2-monooxygenase ([ec:1.14.13.7]), toluene-4-monooxygenase ([ec:1.14.13.236]) from Pseudomonas mendocina, and alkene monooxygenase ([ec:1.14.13.69]) from Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Aromatic and alkene monooxygenase hydroxylases (AAMH) are composed of two copies each of three subunits (alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2), and all three subunits are almost completely α-helical, with the exception of two β hairpin structures in the alpha subunit. The active site of each alpha subunit contains one dinuclear iron centre, housed in a four-helix bundle [[cite:PUB00036067]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methane monooxygenase is a multicomponent enzyme found in methanotrophic bacteria that catalyzes the hydroxylation of methane and higher alkenes (as large as octane). Phenol monooxygenase, found in a diverse group of bacteria, catalyses the hydroxylation of phenol, chloro- and methyl-phenol and naphthol. Both enzyme systems consist of three components: the hydroxylase, a coupling protein and a reductase [[cite:PUB00021642]].  The toluene-4-monooxygenase multicomponent enzyme system catalyzes the O<sub>2</sub>- and NADH-dependent hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol [[cite:PUB00025088]].  The alkene monooxygenase system catalyzes the O<sub>2</sub>- and NADH-dependent epoxidation of short chain (C2 to C6) alkenes to their corresponding epoxides [[cite:PUB00088050]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please see the following relevant references: [[cite:PUB00012263], [cite:PUB00016235], [cite:PUB00016243], [cite:PUB00016237]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3dhi", "name" "Crystal Structure of Reduced Toluene 4-Monoxygenase Hydroxylase Complexed with Effector Protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012348", "name" "Ribonucleotide reductase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01058" "Aromatic and Alkene Monooxygenase Hydroxylase, subunit B, ferritin-like diiron-binding domain"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000040" "Methane/phenol/toluene hydroxylase component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methane/phenol monooxygenase, hydroxylase component", "short" "MP_mOase_hydro"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 88, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 422, "taxa" 2259, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2029, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2023, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1698}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
