{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Spindlin (Spin) and Ssty were first identified for their involvement in gametogenesis. Spindlin was identified as a maternal transcript present in the unfertilised egg and early embryo, and was subsequently shown to interact with the spindle apparatus during oogenesis, and may therefore be important for mitosis [[cite:PUB00008139]]. In addition, spindlin appears to be a target for cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation, and as such may play a role in cell cycle regulation during the transition from gamete to embryo [[cite:PUB00016250]]. Ssty is a multi-copy, Y-linked spermatogenesis-specific transcript that appears to be required for normal spermatogenesis [[cite:PUB00016251]]. Ssty may play an analogous role to spindlin in sperm cells, namely during the transition from sperm cells to early embryo, and in mitosis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7cna", "name" "Crystal structure of Spindlin1/C11orf84 complex bound to histone H3K4me3K9me3 peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042567", "name" "Spindlin/spermiogenesis-specific domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10405" "SPINDLIN"}, "pfam" {"PF02513" "Spin/Ssty Family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spindlin/spermiogenesis-specific protein", "short" "SPIN/Ssty"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 619, "taxa" 2182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2726, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2542, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1677}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003671", :literature {"PUB00016250" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Staub E" "Mennerich D" "Rosenthal A."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11806826&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The Spin/Ssty repeat: a new motif identified in proteins involved in vertebrate development from gamete to embryo.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "RESEARCH0003", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11806826}, "PUB00016251" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Toure A" "Szot M" "Mahadevaiah SK" "Rattigan A" "Ojarikre OA" "Burgoyne PS."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.166.2.901", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "A new deletion of the mouse Y chromosome long arm associated with the loss of Ssty expression, abnormal sperm development and sterility.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "901-12", "volume" "166", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15020475}, "PUB00008139" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Oh B" "Hwang SY" "Solter D" "Knowles BB."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/124/2/493", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Spindlin, a major maternal transcript expressed in the mouse during the transition from oocyte to embryo.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "493-503", "volume" "124", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9053325}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007276", "name" "gamete generation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003671", "name" "Spindlin/spermiogenesis-specific protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 21, "alignment:full" 5012}}}
