{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial YopD like proteins. Virulent Yersinia species harbour a common plasmid that encodes essential virulence determinants (Yersinia outer proteins [Yops]), which are regulated by the extracellular stimuli Ca<sup>2+</sup>and temperature. YopD, also known as Type 3 secretion system translocon protein SctB, is inserted into the host membrane where it contributes to the formation of a pore and allows the translocation of effector proteins into the cytosol of target cells [[cite:PUB00007795], [cite:PUB00151497]]. It contains an amphipathic Î±-helix in its C terminus [[cite:PUB00011518]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05844" "YopD protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YopD-like", "short" "YopD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 185, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 171, "sets" 0, "proteins" 168, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 126}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008898", :literature {"PUB00011518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hakansson S" "Bergman T" "Vanooteghem JC" "Cornelis G" "Wolf-Watz H."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
