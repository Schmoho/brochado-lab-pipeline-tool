{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The function of these proteins is unknown but they are almost always encoded in operons for the SUF system of iron-sulphur cluster biosynthesis. In a few species the SUF system is present elsewhere on the chromosome. This group shares this property of association with the SUF system with a related group, [interpro:IPR014291]. These groups of proteins both share a domain of unknown function which covers the whole protein in [interpro:IPR014291] but only the C-terminal portion of proteins in this entry, which have an additional unique uncharacterised N-terminal domain. As these proteins are encoded immediately downstream of the cysteine desulphurase gene sufS in many contexts, they have been deignated SufT. Homologous proteins not covered by this entry or [interpro:IPR014291] are found in operons associated with phenylacetic acid (or other ring-hydroxylating) degradation pathways.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR034904", "name" "Fe-S cluster assembly domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03406" "putative Fe-S cluster assembly protein SufT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FeS assembly SUF system protein SufT, putative", "short" "FeS_assembly_SufT_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 556, "taxa" 2499, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2735, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2735, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2062}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0137", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0137"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017776", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017776", "name" "FeS assembly SUF system protein SufT, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
