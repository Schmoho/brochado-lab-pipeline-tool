{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SPEAR is a transcription repressor family specific in embryophyte, with many members in land plants. All of them contain a conserved SPL-motif in their N-terminal and an ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif in the C-terminal, and are therefore known as SPL-like, EAR-containing proteins (SPEARs). SPOROCYTELESS (SPL) belongs to this family. SPL and SPEARs may play a variety of developmental roles in plants [[cite:PUB00090847]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33388" "OS01G0212500 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPEAR family", "short" "SPEAR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 244, "taxa" 912, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1293}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040356", :literature {"PUB00090847" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Chen GH" "Sun JY" "Liu M" "Liu J" "Yang WC."], "ISO_journal" "J Genet Genomics", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2014.08.009", "medline_journal" "J Genet Genomics", "title" "SPOROCYTELESS is a novel embryophyte-specific transcription repressor that interacts with TPL and TCP proteins in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "617-25", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25527103}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040356", "name" "SPEAR family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR014855", "name" "Plant transcription factor NOZZLE", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
