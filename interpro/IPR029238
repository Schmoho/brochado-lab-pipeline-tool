{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of prion-like proteins has a neuroprotective function, similar to PrP(C)-like [[cite:PUB00069919]]. Shadoo is mainly expressed in the brain, and highly expressed in the hippocampus, the area of the brain which co-ordinates memory as well as spatial memory and navigation. This protein may also alter the biological actions of normal and abnormal prion protein (PrP) which lead to lethal neurodegenerative diseases [[cite:PUB00069918]]. This family of proteins is found in eukaryotes. Proteins in this family are approximately 150 amino acids in length, of which the first 90 are alanine rich.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28552" "SHADOW OF PRION PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF14999" "Shadow of prion protein, neuroprotective"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shadow of prion protein", "short" "Shadoo"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 197, "taxa" 960, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 356, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 204}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029238", :literature {"PUB00069919" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Watts JC" "Drisaldi B" "Ng V" "Yang J" "Strome B" "Horne P" "Sy MS" "Yoong L" "Young R" "Mastrangelo P" "Bergeron C" "Fraser PE" "Carlson GA" "Mount HT" "Schmitt-Ulms G" "Westaway D."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601830", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The CNS glycoprotein Shadoo has PrP(C)-like protective properties and displays reduced levels in prion infections.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "4038-50", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17703189}, "PUB00069918" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Premzl M" "Sangiorgio L" "Strumbo B" "Marshall Graves JA" "Simonic T" "Gready JE."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(03)00707-8", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Shadoo, a new protein highly conserved from fish to mammals and with similarity to prion protein.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "89-102", "volume" "314", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14527721}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029238", "name" "Shadow of prion protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 134}}}
