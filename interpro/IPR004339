{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UL49 proteins are present in the viral tegument at the surface of the nucleocapsid [[cite:PUB00014884]]. Many of the nonconserved tegument proteins of alpha-herpes viruses play important roles during different steps of the viral replication cycle, such as the shutoff of host cell functions by the vhs protein encoded by UL41 and the transcriptional activation of viral immediate-early genes by the UL48 gene product, VP16. UL49 of Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) has been shown to directly interact with VP16. The UL49 gene products of HHV-1 and Bovine herpesvirus 1 exhibit virus-independent intercellular trafficking of unknown biological function but are dispensable for productive viral replication.</p>\n\n<p>Envelope glycoprotein M (gM) and the complex formed by glycoproteins E (gE) and I (gI) are involved in the secondary envelopment of Suid herpesvirus 1 (Pseudorabies virus, PrV) particles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In the absence of the gE-gI complex and gM, envelopment is blocked and capsids surrounded by tegument proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic domains of gE and gM specifically interact with the C-terminal part of the UL49 gene product of PrV suggesting a role for the protein in secondary envelopment during herpesvirus virion maturation [[cite:PUB00014884]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03117" "UL49 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UL49-related protein", "short" "UL49"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 50, "taxa" 225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 341, "sets" 0, "proteins" 341, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004339", :literature {"PUB00014884" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Fuchs W" "Klupp BG" "Granzow H" "Hengartner C" "Brack A" "Mundt A" "Enquist LW" "Mettenleiter TC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
