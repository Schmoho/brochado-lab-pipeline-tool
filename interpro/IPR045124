{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes protein suppressor of sable (also known as Su(s)) from flies and related proteins from eukaryotes. They contain closely related CCCH zinc finger (ZF) motifs. Su(s) is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that inhibits the accumulation of certain aberrant mRNAs [[cite:PUB00098090]]. It has been shown to interact with Wdr82, and together they inhibit Pol II elongation through Hsp70-alphabeta elements [[cite:PUB00098091]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13119" "ZINC FINGER CCCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein suppressor of sable-like", "short" "Su(sable)-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1856, "taxa" 6603, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4835, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4835, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2754}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045124", :literature {"PUB00098090" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Kuan YS" "Brewer-Jensen P" "Bai WL" "Hunter C" "Wilson CB" "Bass S" "Abernethy J" "Wing JS" "Searles LL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "title" "Drosophila suppressor of sable protein [Su(s)] promotes degradation of aberrant and transposon-derived RNAs.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "5590-603", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19687295}, "PUB00098091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Brewer-Jensen P" "Wilson CB" "Abernethy J" "Mollison L" "Card S" "Searles LL."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Suppressor of sable [Su(s)] and Wdr82 down-regulate RNA from heat-shock-inducible repetitive elements by a mechanism that involves transcription termination.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "139-54", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26577379}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045892", "name" "negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045124", "name" "Protein suppressor of sable-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
