{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are bacterial microcin-V peptides MccV, also known as colicin V. MccV was the first antibiotic substance reported to be produced by E. coli. This antibacterial agent was initially named colicin V (ColV). However, on account of several characteristics (low molecular mass, non-inducible production, and dedicated export system), it became classified within the microcins. The structural gene cvaC encodes the 103-aa MccV precursor. The dedicated export system of MccV has been well characterized and involves two genes that form the second operon. The MccV protein has an N-terminal double glycine motif which precedes the cleavage site for the precursor protein [[cite:PUB00085274]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17508" "Microcin V bacteriocin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Microcin V bacteriocin", "short" "MccV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 98, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 76, "sets" 0, "proteins" 76, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020280", :literature {"PUB00085274" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Duquesne S" "Destoumieux-Garzon D" "Peduzzi J" "Rebuffat S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Prod Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1039/b516237h", "medline_journal" "Nat Prod Rep", "title" "Microcins, gene-encoded antibacterial peptides from enterobacteria.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "708-34", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17653356}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020280", "name" "Microcin V bacteriocin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 3}}}
