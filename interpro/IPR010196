{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the enzyme o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase (MenC) that is involved in one of the steps of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway. The biosynthesis of menaquinone has been studied most in Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00013809]]. 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) is dehydrated by MenC to give the aromatic compound O-succinylbenzoate (OSB) [[cite:PUB00027810]]. MenC, which is a member of the enolase superfamily and x-ray structure has been determined [[cite:PUB00013780], [cite:PUB00024892]]. Many of the common names of the proteins in this family are incorrectly described as O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA synthase.
