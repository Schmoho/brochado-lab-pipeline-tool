{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent a family of small (less than 44 amino acid residues) uncharacterised proteins, that are found exclusively in the Actinobacteria (mostly Streptomyces). The N-terminal half is organised like a signal peptide, beginning Met-Arg and then continuing with a hydrophobic stretch that is unusually rich in alanine. The C-terminal region has a nearly invariant motif TSPxPLLTTVP. The function of these proteins is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033490" "SPW_0924 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPW_0924-like", "short" "SPW_0924-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 170, "taxa" 638, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 601, "sets" 0, "proteins" 601, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 348}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048001", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048001", "name" "SPW_0924-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
