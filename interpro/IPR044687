LPA3 works cooperatively with LPA2 as auxiliary proteins in the incorporation of psbC (also known as CP43) into PSII via interaction with cpSRP translocase ALB3. They are thought to be also involved in synthesis and assembly of psbC [[cite:PUB00096841]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34051" "PROTEIN LOW PSII ACCUMULATION 3, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION 3", "short" "LPA3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 309, "taxa" 1376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 836}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044687", :literature {"PUB00096841" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lu Y."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "Identification and Roles of Photosystem II Assembly, Stability, and Repair Factors in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "168", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26909098}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044687", "name" "Protein LOW PSII ACCUMULATION 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
