{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several invasion associated locus B (IalB) proteins and related sequences. IalB is known to be a major virulence factor in Bartonella bacilliformis where it was shown to have a direct role in human erythrocyte parasitism. IalB is up-regulated in response to environmental cues signalling vector-to-host transmission. Such environmental cues would include, but not be limited to, temperature, pH, oxidative stress, and haemin limitation. It is also thought that IalB would aide B. bacilliformis survival under stress-inducing environmental conditions [[cite:PUB00012835]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038696", "name" "Invasion protein B superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06776" "Invasion associated locus B (IalB) protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Invasion protein B", "short" "Invasion_prot_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 1240, "taxa" 4545, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8873}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010642", :literature {"PUB00012835" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Coleman SA" "Minnick MF."], "ISO_journal" "Microb.
