{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents diguanylate cyclase A (DgcA, [ec:2.7.7.65]) from Spirochetes, such as DgcA from Treponema denticola [[cite:PUB00151318]]. It catalyses the conversion of GTP to cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) under aerobic and anaerobic reaction conditions. Treponema denticola is a pathogen associated to periodontal disease (PD), a progressive inflammatory condition characterised by degradation of the gingival epithelium, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone ultimately resulting in tooth loss, which contributes to immune dysregulation and direct tissue destruction.
