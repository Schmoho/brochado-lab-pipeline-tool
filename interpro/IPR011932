{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are part of the wider so-called \"phage\" integrase fmaily which describes a number of recombinases with tyrosine active sites that transiently bind covalently to DNA. Many are associated with mobile DNA elements, including phage, transposons, and phase variation loci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the chromosomally-encoded polypeptide XerD, which is closely related to, and interacts with, another chromosomally-encoded polypeptide, XerC ([interpro:IPR011931]). These proteins are site-specific tyrosine recombinases, which act by catalyzing the cutting and rejoining of the recombining DNA molecules [[cite:PUB00015510]]. They form a cyclic heterotetrameric complex composed of two molecules of XerC and two molecules of XerD. The XerC-XerD complex is essential to convert dimers of the bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation at cell division. It also contributes to the segregational stability of plasmids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XerD is composed of two domains, an N-terminal α-helical domain, and a C-terminal domain composed mostly of α helices, with a three-stranded antiprallel β sheet along one edge [[cite:PUB00020091]]. The active site is found at the extreme C-terminal end of the polypeptide. Most of the C-terminal domain is structurally homologous to that of other \"phage\" integrases, but the active site regions of these enzymes are stucturally distinct.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013762", "name" "Integrase-like, catalytic domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011010", "name" "DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme, catalytic core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01807" "Tyrosine recombinase XerD [xerD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02225" "site-specific tyrosine recombinase XerD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine recombinase XerD", "short" "Recomb_XerD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5626, "taxa" 22322, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25109, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25109, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19373}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011932", :literature {"PUB00015510" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yates J" "Aroyo M" "Sherratt DJ" "Barre FX."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
