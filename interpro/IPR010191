{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents IMP cyclohydrolase, which catalyses the cyclisation of 5-formylamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide to inosine monophosphate (IMP), a reaction which is important in de novo purine biosynthesis in archaeal species [[cite:PUB00013793]]. This single domain protein is arranged to form an overall fold that consists of a four-layered α-β-β-α core structure. The two antiparallel β-sheets pack against each other and are covered by α-helices on one face of the molecule. The protein is structurally similar to members of the N-terminal nucleophile (NTN) hydrolase superfamily. A deep pocket was in fact found on the surface of IMP cyclohydrolase in a position equivalent to that of active sites of NTN-hydrolases, but an N-terminal nucleophile could not be found. Therefore, it is thought that this enzyme is structurally but not functionally similar to members of the NTN-hydrolase family [[cite:PUB00016548]].</p>\n\n<p>In bacteria this step is catalysed by a bifunctional enzyme (purH).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036795", "name" "Inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00705" "IMP cyclohydrolase [purO]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004866" "IMP cyclohydrolase, archaeal type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01922" "IMP cyclohydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IMP cyclohydrolase", "short" "IMP_cyclohydrolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 165, "taxa" 973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 768, "sets" 0, "proteins" 768, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 642}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0110", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0110"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
