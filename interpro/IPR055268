{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of enzymes involved in transfer of carboxyl group such as Pyruvate carboxylase, Oxaloacetate decarboxylase and Methylmalonyl-CoA carboxyltransferase. Pyruvate carboxylase (PCB) catalyses a 2-step reaction, involving the ATP-dependent carboxylation of the covalently attached biotin in the first step and the transfer of the carboxyl group to pyruvate in the second, leading to oxaloacetate production [[cite:PUB00155210]].  In B.subtilis, this enzyme plays an anaplerotic function as it is necessary for growth on glucose, but is not required for sporulation [[cite:PUB00155210]]. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase catalyses the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate coupled to Na+ translocation [[cite:PUB00155209]] whereas Methylmalonyl-CoA carboxyltransferase 5S subunit specifically catalyses the transfer of the carboxyl group from biotin of the 1.3S subunit to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate and 1.3S biotin [[cite:PUB00030767]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vz0", "name" "Crystal structure of Lactococcus lactis pyruvate carboxylase G746A mutant in complex with cyclic-di-AMP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43778" "PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyruvate carboxylase-like", "short" "PCB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7070, "taxa" 26645, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35264, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35264, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27201}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
