However, sequence similarity between TapY2 and PilY2 is very low, and is not certain to represent a true homology.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038109" "TapY2 family type IVa secretion system protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type IVa secretion system protein TapY2-like", "short" "TapY2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 229, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 210, "sets" 0, "proteins" 210, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 155}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049848", :literature {"PUB00105564" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Boyd JM" "Dacanay A" "Knickle LC" "Touhami A" "Brown LL" "Jericho MH" "Johnson SC" "Reith M."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "Contribution of type IV pili to the virulence of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1445-55", "volume" "76", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18212071}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049848", "name" "Type IVa secretion system protein TapY2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
