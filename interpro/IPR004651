{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Histidine is formed by several complex and distinct biochemical reactions catalysed by eight enzymes. Proteins involved in steps 4 and 6 of the histidine biosynthesis pathway are contained in one family. These enzymes are called \r\nHis6 and His7 in eukaryotes and HisA and HisF in prokaryotes [[cite:PUB00039276], [cite:PUB00081081], [cite:PUB00025531]]. HisA is a phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.16]), involved in the fourth step of histidine biosynthesis. The bacterial HisF protein is a cyclase which catalyzes the cyclization reaction that produces D-erythro-imidazole glycerol phosphate during the sixth step of histidine biosynthesis. HisF is also known as imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase [[cite:PUB00081080], [cite:PUB00081035], [cite:PUB00021977]].  The yeast His7 protein is a bifunctional protein which catalyzes an amido-transferase reaction that generates imidazole-glycerol phosphate and 5-aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide. The latter is the ribonucleotide used for purine biosynthesis. The enzyme also catalyzes the cyclization reaction that produces D-erythro-imidazole glycerol phosphate, and is involved in the fifth and sixth steps in histidine biosynthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family describes the histidine biosynthesis protein, HisF.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1h5y", "name" "HisF protein from Pyrobaculum aerophilum"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04731" "HisF"}, "hamap" {"MF_01013" "Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF [hisF]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00735" "imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine biosynthesis, HisF", "short" "HisF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 50, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9988, "taxa" 37019, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40539, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30935}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0109", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0109"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
