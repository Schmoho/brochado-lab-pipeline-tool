{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of prokaryotic dehydrogenases with a FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain, including Sulfide dehydrogenase subunit alpha (SudA) and Oxidoreductase ([swissprot:I6V148]) from Pyrococcus furiosus. SudA is a bifunctional enzyme with four iron-sulfur centers that catalyses the reduction of elemental sulfur or polysulfide to hydrogen sulfide with NADPH as electron donor [[cite:PUB00150967]]. It also functions as a reduced ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductase with a very high affinity for reduced ferredoxin [[cite:PUB00150966]]. [swissprot:I6V148], also a bifunctional enzyme, plays an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis [[cite:PUB00150968]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5jca", "name" "NADP(H) bound NADH-dependent Ferredoxin:NADP Oxidoreductase (NfnI) from Pyrococcus furiosus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01316" "NADPH-dependent glutamate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfide dehydrogenase subunit alpha-like", "short" "SudA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1287, "taxa" 6608, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7570, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5684}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
