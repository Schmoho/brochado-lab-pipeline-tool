{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the T-superfamily of conotoxins. Eight different T-superfamily peptides from five Conus species were identified. These peptides share a consensus signal sequence, and a conserved arrangement of cysteine residues. T-superfamily peptides were found expressed in venom ducts of all major feeding types of Conus, suggesting that the T-superfamily is a large and diverse group of peptides, widely distributed in the 500 different Conus species [[cite:PUB00016378]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08097" "Conotoxin T-superfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conotoxin T-superfamily", "short" "Toxin_26"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 19, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012631", :literature {"PUB00016378" {"URL" nil, "issue" "43", "authors" ["Walker CS" "Steel D" "Jacobsen RB" "Lirazan MB" "Cruz LJ" "Hooper D" "Shetty R" "DelaCruz RC" "Nielsen JS" "Zhou LM" "Bandyopadhyay P" "Craig AG" "Olivera BM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
