{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes cyclin A, cyclin B and related sequences. Cyclin A/B are essential (and the most active) for the control of the cell cycle at the G2/M (mitosis) transition. They confer different substrate recognition properties on CDK2 [[cite:PUB00041933], [cite:PUB00101520]]. DENR, an oncogene identified in several tumours, is phosphorylated by Cyclin A/CDK2 and Cyclin B/CDK1 at the onset of mitosis which promotes mitotic protein translation and faithful cell division [[cite:PUB00101520]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that play an active role in controlling nuclear cell division cycles [[cite:PUB00014103]], and regulate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins, together with the p34 (cdc2) or cdk2 kinases, form the Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF). There are two main groups of cyclins, G1/S cyclins, which are essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S (start) transition, and G2/M cyclins, which are essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G2/M (mitosis) transition. G2/M cyclins accumulate steadily during G2 and are abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase). In most species, there are multiple forms of G1 and G2 cyclins. For example, in vertebrates, there are two G2 cyclins, A and B, and at least three G1 cyclins, C, D, and E.</p>\r\n<p>Cyclin homologues have been found in various viruses, including Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 (Herpesvirus saimiri) and Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus). These viral homologues differ from their cellular counterparts in that the viral proteins have gained new functions and eliminated others to harness the cell and benefit the virus [[cite:PUB00014101]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4eoj", "name" "Thr 160 phosphorylated CDK2 H84S, Q85M, K89D - human cyclin A3 complex with ATP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001771" "Cyclin, A/B/D/E types"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclin A/B-like", "short" "Cyclin_A/B-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 139, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2516, "taxa" 8967, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9889}, "pathways" 151}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046965", :literature {"PUB00041933" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Brown NR" "Lowe ED" "Petri E" "Skamnaki V" "Antrobus R" "Johnson LN."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Cycle", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Cycle", "title" "Cyclin B and cyclin A confer different substrate recognition properties on CDK2.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1350-9", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17495531}, "PUB00101520" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Clemm von Hohenberg K" "Muller S" "Schleich S" "Meister M" "Bohlen J" "Hofmann TG" "Teleman AA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Cyclin B/CDK1 and Cyclin A/CDK2 phosphorylate DENR to promote mitotic protein translation and faithful cell division.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "668", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35115540}, "PUB00014101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Hardwick JM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
