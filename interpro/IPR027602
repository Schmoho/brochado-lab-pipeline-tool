{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Poly(gamma-glutamic acid), or PGA, is an extracellular structural polymer found in Bacillus subtilis and a number of other species. PGA is sometimes capsule-forming, sometimes secretory, and may be produced by Gram-positive (single plasma membrane) and Gram-negative (inner and outer membranes) bacteria, so export and/or attachment machinery may differ from system to system. Members of this family occur in a subset of PGA operons, in lineages that include Francisella, Leptospira, Treponema, Thermotoga, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium, amongst others.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04332" "poly-gamma-glutamate system protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poly-gamma-glutamate system protein", "short" "PGA_system"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 95, "taxa" 922, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 851, "sets" 0, "proteins" 851, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 661}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027602", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027602", "name" "Poly-gamma-glutamate system protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
