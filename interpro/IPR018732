{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Dpy-19 protein from Caenorhabditis elegans and its homologues in other Metazoa, including mammals.  In C. elegans, Dpy-19 is required to orient neuroblasts QL and QR correctly on the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis. These neuroblasts are born in the same A/P position, but polarise and migrate left/right asymmetrically, where QL migrates toward the posterior and QR migrates toward the anterior. After their migrations, QL (but not QR) switches on the Hox gene mab-5. Dpy-19 is required along with Unc-40 to express Mab-5 correctly in the Q cell descendants [[cite:PUB00044879]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31488" "DPY-19-LIKE 1, LIKE (H.
