{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutamate, leucine, phenylalanine, valine and tryptophan dehydrogenases are structurally and functionally related. They contain a Gly-rich region containing a conserved Lys residue, which has been implicated in the catalytic activity, in each case a reversible oxidative deamination reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Glutamate dehydrogenases ([ec:1.4.1.2], [ec:1.4.1.3], and [ec:1.4.1.4]) (GluDH) are enzymes that catalyse the NAD-and/or NADP-dependent reversible deamination of L-glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate [[cite:PUB00001430], [cite:PUB00003424]]. GluDH isozymes are generally involved with either ammonia assimilation or glutamate catabolism. Two separate enzymes are present in yeasts: the NADP-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the amination of alpha-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate; and the NAD-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the reverse reaction [[cite:PUB00002418]] -this form links the L-amino acids with the Krebs cycle, which provides a major pathway for metabolic interconversion of alpha-amino acids and alpha-keto acids [[cite:PUB00004656]].  In rice, glutamate dehydrogenase 3 is mitochondrial.</p>\n\n<p>Leucine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.4.1.9]) (LeuDH) is a NAD-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible deamination of leucine and several other aliphatic amino acids to their keto analogues [[cite:PUB00000302]]. Each subunit of this octameric enzyme from Bacillus sphaericus contains 364 amino acids and folds into two domains, separated by a deep cleft. The nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor binds deep in this cleft, which is thought to close during the hydride transfer step of the catalytic cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Phenylalanine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.4.1.20]) (PheDH) is na NAD-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible deamidation of L-phenylalanine into phenyl-pyruvate [[cite:PUB00002347]].</p>\n\n<p>Valine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.4.1.8]) (ValDH) is an NADP-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible deamidation of L-valine into 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate [[cite:PUB00002221]].</p>\n\n<p>L-tryptophan dehydrogenase catalyses the reversible oxidative deamination of L-tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvate in the presence of NAD+ [[cite:PUB00101896], [cite:PUB00101895]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR046346", "name" "Aminoacid dehydrogenase-like, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00082" "GLFDHDRGNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamate/phenylalanine/leucine/valine/L-tryptophan dehydrogenase", "short" "Glu/Leu/Phe/Val/Trp_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 128, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10073, "taxa" 39124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 243290, "sets" 0, "proteins" 64670, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 49036}, "pathways" 24}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00071", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00071"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
