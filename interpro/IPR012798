{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a structurally complex cofactor, consisting of a modified tetrapyrrole with a centrally chelated cobalt. Cobalamin is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: methylcobalamin and adocobalamin. Most prokaryotes, as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes, whereas plants and fungi do not appear to use it. In bacteria and archaea, these include methionine synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, glutamate and methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, ethanolamine ammonia lyase, and diol dehydratase [[cite:PUB00015657]]. In mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [[cite:PUB00035308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents CobG from the aerobic pathway. CobG (precorrin-3b synthase, [ec:1.14.13.83],) is a mono-oxygenase containing an iron-sulphur centre. CobG generates a gamma-lactone with the acetate side chain on ring A to give precorrin-3b. An oxygen atom from dioxygen is incorporated into the macrocycle at C-20. In the aerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, four enzymes are involved in the conversion of precorrin-3A to precorrin-6A. The first of the four steps is carried out by CobG, yielding precorrin-3B as the product. This is followed by three methylation reactions, which introduce a methyl group at C-17 (CobJ; [ec:2.1.1.131]), C-11 (CobM; [ec:2.1.1.133]) and C-1 (CobF; [ec:2.1.1.152]) of the macrocycle, giving rise to precorrin-4, precorrin-5 and precorrin-6A, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>This entry also contains ferredoxin-nitrite reductase ([ec:2.1.1.152]), a key enzyme in the process of nitrogen assimilation that makes use of a sirohaem-iron-sulphur cofactor [[cite:PUB00035342]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02435" "precorrin-3B synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis CobG-like", "short" "Cbl_synth_CobG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1096, "taxa" 5006, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5074, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5074, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3913}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
