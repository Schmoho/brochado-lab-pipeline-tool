{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The nuclear hormone receptor subfamily 5 includes group A member 1 (NR5A1) or steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), group A member 2 (NR5A) or liver receptor homologue-1, and FTZ-F1 (group A member 3) and FTZ-F1 beta (group B member 1) from Drosophila [[cite:PUB00092654], [cite:PUB00092656]]. SF-1 is a key regulator for steroid biosynthesis and essential for sexual differentiation and formation of the primary steroidogenic tissues [[cite:PUB00073521], [cite:PUB00101474], [cite:PUB00101473]]. NR5A2 is involved in bile acid/cholesterol homeostasis and in the development of some human cancers [[cite:PUB00092655]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands [[cite:PUB00015853]]. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner [[cite:PUB00004464], [cite:PUB00006168]]. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed 'orphan' receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yp0", "name" "Structure of the steroidogenic factor-1 ligand binding domain bound to phospholipid and a SHP peptide motif"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035500", "name" "Nuclear hormone receptor-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24086" "NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 5 GROUP A"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002530" "Orphan nuclear receptor Fushi-tarazu factor 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear hormone receptor family 5-like", "short" "NR5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 41, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 999, "taxa" 4056, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5059, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4868, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3143}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016355", :literature {"PUB00101474" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Werner R" "Monig I" "Lunstedt R" "Wunsch L" "Thorns C" "Reiz B" "Krause A" "Schwab KO" "Binder G" "Holterhus PM" "Hiort O."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "New NR5A1 mutations and phenotypic variations of gonadal dysgenesis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "e0176720", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28459839}, "PUB00006168" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["De Vos P" "Schmitt J" "Verhoeven G" "Stunnenberg HG."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/22.7.1161", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Human androgen receptor expressed in HeLa cells activates transcription in vitro.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "1161-6", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8165128}, "PUB00092654" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Fayard E" "Auwerx J" "Schoonjans K."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Cell Biol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2004.03.008", "medline_journal" "Trends Cell Biol", "title" "LRH-1: an orphan nuclear receptor involved in development, metabolism and steroidogenesis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "250-60", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15130581}, "PUB00073521" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lan HC" "Li HJ" "Lin G" "Lai PY" "Chung BC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
