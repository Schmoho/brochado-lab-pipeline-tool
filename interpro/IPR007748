{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes protein AC109 from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV).  The gene (Orf1090) is essential and transcribed late in virus assembly, and protein AC109 has been shown to be important for the transport of the budded virion to the host nucleus.  In mutants lacking the AC109 gene, virions are unable to enter the nucleus and remain in the cytoplasm.  Although addition of AC109 allowed virions to enter the nucleus, the occlusion bodies were empty, indicating that AC109 is also important for the production of infectious budded virus [[cite:PUB00082303], [cite:PUB00082304]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05054" "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), Orf109", "short" "AcMNPV_Orf109"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007748", :literature {"PUB00082303" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Alfonso V" "Maroniche GA" "Reca SR" "Lopez MG" "del Vas M" "Taboga O."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046146", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "AcMNPV core gene ac109 is required for budded virion transport to the nucleus and for occlusion of viral progeny.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e46146", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23049963}, "PUB00082304" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lehiy CJ" "Wu W" "Berretta MF" "Passarelli AL."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.10.015", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus open reading frame 109 affects infectious budded virus production and nucleocapsid envelopment in the nucleus of cells.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "442-52", "volume" "435", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23149091}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007748", "name" "Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), Orf109", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 84}}}
