{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the RNA-binding protein KhpA, a probable RNA chaperone. It forms a complex with KhpB (also known as Jag or EloR) which binds to cellular RNA and controls its expression. KhpA plays a role in peptidoglycan (PG) homeostasis and cell length regulation [[cite:PUB00100213]]. The KhpA-KhpB complex stimulates or controls elongasome-mediated lateral cell wall biosynthesis. It is not clear what is the function of the KhpA homooligomer in vivo [[cite:PUB00100215]]. KhpA forms homodimers, additionally, it interacts with the KH-II domain of EloR, a key regulator of cell elongation in S. pneumoniae, forming an EloR/KhpA heterodimer [[cite:PUB00100215]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009019", "name" "K homology domain superfamily, prokaryotic type", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015946", "name" "K homology domain-like, alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34654" "UPF0109 PROTEIN SCO5592"}, "cdd" {"cd22533" "type II K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain found in Bacillus subtilis UPF0109 protein YlqC and similar proteins"}, "hamap" {"MF_00088" "RNA-binding protein KhpA [khpA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding protein KhpA", "short" "KhpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4335, "taxa" 18193, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20359, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20359, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15647}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020627", :literature {"PUB00100213" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zheng JJ" "Perez AJ" "Tsui HT" "Massidda O" "Winkler ME."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Absence of the KhpA and KhpB (JAG/EloR) RNA-binding proteins suppresses the requirement for PBP2b by overproduction of FtsA in Streptococcus pneumoniae D39.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "793-814", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28941257}, "PUB00100215" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Winther AR" "Kjos M" "Stamsas GA" "Havarstein LS" "Straume D."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Prevention of EloR/KhpA heterodimerization by introduction of site-specific amino acid substitutions renders the essential elongasome protein PBP2b redundant in Streptococcus pneumoniae.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "3681", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30842445}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020627", "name" "RNA-binding protein KhpA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
