{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This subfamily of peroxiredoxin (known as 1-cys PRX) composed of PRXs containing only one conserved cysteine, which serves as the peroxidatic cysteine. They are homodimeric thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins that confer a protective role in cells by reducing and detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and organic hydroperoxides [[cite:PUB00097724]]. As with all other PRXs, a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate is formed upon reaction of 1-cys PRX with its substrates. Having no resolving cysteine, the oxidized enzyme is resolved by an external small-molecule or protein reductant such as thioredoxin or glutaredoxin. Similar to typical 2-cys PRX, 1-cys PRX forms a functional dimeric unit with a B-type interface, as well as a decameric structure which is stabilized in the reduced form of the enzyme. Other oligomeric forms, tetramers and hexamers, have also been reported [[cite:PUB00032530], [cite:PUB00044127], [cite:PUB00097725]]. Mammalian 1-cys PRX is localized cellularly in the cytosol and is expressed at high levels in brain, eye, testes and lung [[cite:PUB00044127]]. The seed-specific plant 1-cys PRXs protect tissues from reactive oxygen species during desiccation and are also called rehydrins [[cite:PUB00097727], [cite:PUB00097726]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ykj", "name" "Structural basis of the thiol resolving mechanism in yeast mitochondrial 1-Cys peroxiredoxin via glutathione/thioredoxin systems"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03016" "PRX_1cys"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "1-Cys peroxiredoxin", "short" "PRX_1cys"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4922, "taxa" 20111, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18171, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18170, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13779}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
