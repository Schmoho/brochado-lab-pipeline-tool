{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes movement proteins from various viruses, including Movement protein (also known as Protein 3A) from Bromoviruses and Cucumoviruses, whose genomes contain 3 RNA segments. The third segment (RNA 3) contains two proteins, the coat protein and the 3A protein. Protein 3A has been shown to be involved in cell-to-cell movement of the virus [[cite:PUB00005623]]. The protein family also includes NSm protein from Tomato spotted wilt virus which is involved in tubule formation, movement and symptomatology [[cite:PUB00099796]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00803" "3A/RNA2 movement protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Movement protein", "short" "MPV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 37, "taxa" 263, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000603", :literature {"PUB00005623" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Canto T" "Prior DA" "Hellwald KH" "Oparka KJ" "Palukaitis P."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.1997.8804", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Characterization of cucumber mosaic virus.
