{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin, is a neurotransmitter that it is primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, platelets, and in the central nervous system (CNS). It is implicated in a vast array of physiological and pathophysiological pathways. Receptors for 5-HT mediate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, and modulate the release of many neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, epinephrine/norepinephrine, and acetylcholine, as well as many hormones, including oxytocin, prolactin, vasopressin and cortisol. In the CNS, 5-HT receptors can influence various neurological processes, such as aggression, anxiety and appetite and, as a, result are the target of a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics and anorectics [[cite:PUB00064376]].</p>\n\n<p>The 5-HT receptors are grouped into a number of distinct subtypes, classified according to their antagonist susceptibilities and their affinities for 5-HT. With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel [[cite:PUB00066704]], all 5-HT receptors are members of the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor family [[cite:PUB00064376]], and they activate an intracellular second messenger cascade to produce their responses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The 5-HT1 receptors are a subfamily of 5-HT receptors that were originally classified according to their inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, degree of sequence similarity and their overlapping pharmacological specificities. The subfamily is comprised of five different receptors 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, and they can couple to Gi/Go and mediate inhibitory neurotransmission, although signalling via other transduction systems are known. One of the 5-HT1 receptors, the 5-HT1E receptor, is yet to achieve receptor status from the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR), since a robust response mediated via the protein has not been reported in the literature.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the 5-HT1F receptors, they are thought to be closely related 5-HT1E receptors.  They have a limited distribution in peripheral tissues in human, and have been detected only in the uterus and mesentery [[cite:PUB00064431]].  In the CNS, receptor mRNA is present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, raphe and spinal cord [[cite:PUB00064433], [cite:PUB00064431], [cite:PUB00064434]].  Elucidation of the physiological role of 5-HT1F receptors requires development of selective ligands. At present, there are no selective antagonists or agonists. However, the 5-HT1D/5-HTD1B agonist and anti-migraine compound sumatriptan has reasonable affinity.  Interestingly, 5-HT1F receptor expression has been detected in the trigeminal ganglia, stimulation of which leads to the plasma extravasation in the dura, a component of neurogenic inflammation thought to be a possible cause of migraine [[cite:PUB00064435]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd15334" "serotonin receptor subtype 1F, member of the class A family of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5-Hydroxytryptamine 1F receptor", "short" "5HT1F_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 508, "taxa" 1615, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 565, "sets" 0, "proteins" 565, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 451}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"iuphar" {"displayName" "IUPHAR receptor code", "description" "The IUPHAR database incorporates detailed pharmacological, functional and pathophysiological information on G Protein-Coupled Receptors, Voltage-Gated Ion Channels, Ligand-Gated Ion Channels and Nuclear Hormone Receptors.", "rank" 22, "accessions" [{"accession" "5", "url" "https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=5"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000450", :literature {"PUB00064431" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Adham N" "Kao HT" "Schecter LE" "Bard J" "Olsen M" "Urquhart D" "Durkin M" "Hartig PR" "Weinshank RL" "Branchek TA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
