{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of bacterial toxins that forms one component of the type II toxin-antitoxin system in E. coli whose antitoxin is represented by YefM, found in [interpro:IPR006442].  The plasmid encoded Axe-Txe proteins in Enterococcus faecium act as an antitoxin-toxin pair. When the plasmid is lost, the antitoxin is degraded relatively quickly by host enzymes. This allows the toxin to interact with its intracellular target, thus killing the cell or impeding cell growth [[cite:PUB00015566]]. These toxins are highly potent protein synthesis inhibitors, specifically blocking the initiation of translation. In the case of YoeB, it binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunit in 70 S ribosomes and interacts with the A site leading to mRNA cleavage at this site. As a result, the 3'-end portion of the mRNA is released from ribosomes, and translation initiation is effectively inhibited [[cite:PUB00075545], [cite:PUB00075546]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2a6s", "name" "Crystal structure of YoeB under isopropanol condition"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035093", "name" "Toxin-antitoxin system, RelE/ParE toxin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38039" "TOXIN YOEB"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02116" "Txe/YoeB family addiction module toxin"}, "pfam" {"PF06769" "YoeB-like toxin of bacterial type II toxin-antitoxin system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin YoeB", "short" "YoeB_toxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 2081, "taxa" 10537, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12218, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12217, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9439}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1133", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1133"} {"accession" "GenProp0321", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0321"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009614", :literature {"PUB00015566" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Grady R" "Hayes F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
