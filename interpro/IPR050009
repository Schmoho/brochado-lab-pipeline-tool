{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the homologues of 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase QuiC found mainly in Pseudomonas species. This enzyme catalyses the conversion of 3-dehydroshikimate to protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), a common intermediate of quinate and shikimate degradation pathways. It is required for growth on either quinate or shikimate as a sole carbon source [[cite:PUB00094476]]. The structure of a QuiC1 enzyme from P. putida revealed that the protein is a fusion of two distinct modules: an N-terminal sugar phosphate isomerase-like domain associated with dehydroshikimate dehydratase activity and a novel C-terminal hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like domain [[cite:PUB00094476]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF042435" "3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase QuiC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase QuiC", "short" "QuiC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 36, "taxa" 599, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 830, "sets" 0, "proteins" 830, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 647}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
