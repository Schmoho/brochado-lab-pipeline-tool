{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CofJ from Escherichia coli ([swissprot:Q93I65]) and similar sequences from Enterobacterales. CofJ is a soluble protein secreted via the CFA/III apparatus in Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which colonize the human gut causing severe diarrhoea. CofJ is a single-domain protein of 326 residues, comprised of an elongated β-sandwich core with three α-helices, four 3-10 helices and multiple loops on its surface. The protein has a cluster of exposed hydrophobic side-chains at one end and structural homology to the pore-forming proteins perfringolysin O and alpha-haemolysin. The crystal structure of CofJ was determined, revealing a large β-sandwich protein that bears no sequence or structural homology to TcpF, a protein encoded by the syntenic gene in the TCP operon of Vibrio cholerae. CofJ binds to lipid vesicles and epithelial cells, suggesting a role in membrane attachment during ETEC colonization [[cite:PUB00153879], [cite:PUB00154417]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5yq0", "name" "Crystal structure of secreted protein CofJ from ETEC."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21874" "CofJ protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CofJ", "short" "CofJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 15, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054068", :literature {"PUB00154417" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["Oki H" "Kawahara K" "Maruno T" "Imai T" "Muroga Y" "Fukakusa S" "Iwashita T" "Kobayashi Y" "Matsuda S" "Kodama T" "Iida T" "Yoshida T" "Ohkubo T" "Nakamura S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1805671115", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Interplay of a secreted protein with type IVb pilus for efficient enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> colonization.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "7422-7427", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29941571}, "PUB00153879" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Yuen AS" "Kolappan S" "Ng D" "Craig L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.12407", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Structure and secretion of CofJ, a putative colonization factor of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "898-918", "volume" "90", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24106767}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054068", "name" "CofJ", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 1}}}
