{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutathione (GSH), the major low-molecular-weight thiol compound in most eukaryotic cells, is normally degraded through the gamma-glutamyl cycle initiated by the action of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A novel pathway for the degradation of GSH that requires the participation of three previously uncharacterised genes has been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These genes are Dug1 (YFR044c), Dug2 (YBR281c), and Dug3 (YNL191w), which is defective in utilization of glutathione. Although dipeptides and tripeptides with a normal peptide bond, such as cys-gly or glu-cys-gly, can be hydrolysed by the Dug1 protein (a metallopeptidase), the presence of an unusual peptide bond, such as in GSH, requires the participation of the Dug2 and Dug3 gene products as well. The Dug3 gene encodes a protein with a glutamine amidotransferase domain. These three proteins form a GSH degradosomal complex [[cite:PUB00035950]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037237" "Metallopeptidase with WD repeats, DUG2 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutathione degradosome, Dug2", "short" "GSH_degradosome_Dug2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1061, "taxa" 2814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1693, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1532, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 952}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017149", :literature {"PUB00035950" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ganguli D" "Kumar C" "Bachhawat AK."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.106.066944", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The alternative pathway of glutathione degradation is mediated by a novel protein complex involving three new genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1137-51", "volume" "175", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17179087}, "PUB00085123" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kaur H" "Ganguli D" "Bachhawat AK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
