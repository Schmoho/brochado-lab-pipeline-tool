They allow the positioning of the bacteria at the favourable depth for growth. Gas vesicles are hollow cylindrical tubes, closed by a hollow, conical cap at each end. Both the conical end caps and central cylinder are made up of 4-5 nm wide ribs that run at right angles to the long axis of the structure. Gas vesicles seem to be constituted of two different protein components, GvpA and GvpC. GvpA, a small protein of about 70 amino acid residues, is the main constituent of gas vesicles and form the essential core of the structure, while GvpC binds the exterior of the GV and provides additional structural reinforcement [[cite:PUB00151158]]. The sequence of GVPa is extremely well conserved. GvpJ and GvpM, two proteins encoded in the cluster of genes required for gas vesicle synthesis in the archaebacteria Halobacterium salinarum and Halobacterium mediterranei (Haloferax mediterranei), have been found [[cite:PUB00001807]] to be evolutionary related to GVPa. The exact function of these two proteins is not known, although they could be important for determining the shape determination gas vesicles. The N-terminal domain of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae protein GvpA/J is also related to GvpA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00576" "Gas vesicle protein A [gvpA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gas vesicle protein GvpA", "short" "Gas_vesicle_GvpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 800, "taxa" 3252, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3269, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3269, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2492}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047870", :literature {"PUB00151157" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Dutka P" "Metskas LA" "Hurt RC" "Salahshoor H" "Wang TY" "Malounda D" "Lu GJ" "Chou TF" "Shapiro MG" "Jensen GJ."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure of Anabaena flos-aquae gas vesicles revealed by cryo-ET.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "518-528.e6", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37040766}, "PUB00151158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Huber ST" "Terwiel D" "Evers WH" "Maresca D" "Jakobi AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Cryo-EM structure of gas vesicles for buoyancy-controlled motility.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "975-986.e13", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36868215}, "PUB00151160" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Walsby AE."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol Rev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiol Rev", "title" "Gas vesicles.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "94-144", "volume" "58", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8177173}, "PUB00151156" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Knitsch R" "Schneefeld M" "Weitzel K" "Pfeifer F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Mutations in the major gas vesicle protein GvpA and impacts on gas vesicle formation in Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "530-542", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28898511}, "PUB00000481" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Walsby AE" "Hayes PK."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
