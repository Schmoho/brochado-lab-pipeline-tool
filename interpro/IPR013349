{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are type III secretion system effectors, named differently in different species and designated YopR in Yersinia and AscH in Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida [[cite:PUB00035493], [cite:PUB00106696]]. Yersinia employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to secrete and translocate virulence factors into to the cytoplasm of mammalian host cells. One of the secreted virulence factors is YopR (Yersinia outer protein R, named Type 3 secretion system regulator YopR), encoded by the YscH (Yersinia secretion H) gene [[cite:PUB00035493], [cite:PUB00106696]]. This Yop protein is unusual in that it is released to the extracellular environment rather than injected directly into the target cell as are most Yop proteins [[cite:PUB00021003], [cite:PUB00021004]]. These are regulatory proteins that control the polymerisation of the needle [[cite:PUB00106696]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1z21", "name" "Crystal structure of the core domain of Yersinia pestis virulence factor YopR"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR041814", "name" "Type III secretion system virulence factor YopR, core domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09025" "YopR, type III needle-polymerisation regulator"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02509" "YopR family T3SS polymerization control protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system effector YopR", "short" "T3SS_YopR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 161, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 151, "sets" 0, "proteins" 151, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 111}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013349", :literature {"PUB00035493" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Schubot FD" "Cherry S" "Austin BP" "Tropea JE" "Waugh DS."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1110/ps.051446405", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Crystal structure of the protease-resistant core domain of Yersinia pestis virulence factor YopR.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1679-83", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15930010}, "PUB00106696" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Vanden Bergh P" "Frey J."], "ISO_journal" "Microb Biotechnol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microb Biotechnol", "title" "Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in the light of its type-three secretion system.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "381-400", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24119189}, "PUB00021003" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lee VT" "Schneewind O."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
