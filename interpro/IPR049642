{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bifunctional endo-1,4-beta-xylanase/feruloyl esterase from Prevotella ruminicola ([swissprot:D5EY13]) and related bacterial proteins exclusively from Bacteroidales.  This enzyme is involved in degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides. It has endo-xylanase activity towards substrates such as oat spelt xylan (OSX), acetylated xylo-oligosaccharides and acetylated xylan, producing primarily xylobiose. It also has feruloyl esterase activity, releasing ferulic acid from methylferulate, and from the more natural substrates such as wheat bran and corn fibre [[cite:PUB00097679], [cite:PUB00088861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041944" "bifunctional endo-1,4-beta-xylanase/feruloyl esterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional endo-1,4-beta-xylanase/feruloyl esterase", "short" "Xylase_Ferestase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 70, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 64, "sets" 0, "proteins" 64, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 48}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
