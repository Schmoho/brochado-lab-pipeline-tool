{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Fe/S-dependent 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase (AcnD; [ec:4.2.1.99]), which is part of the 2-methylcitrate (2-MC) cycle that occurs in certain fungi and bacteria. The 2-MC cycle is involved in the degradation of propionyl-CoA via 2-methylcitrate, with AcnD functioning after PrpD and before PrpB. AcnD acts to catalyse the dehydration of 2-methylcitrate and citrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate and cis-aconitate, respectively, as well as to catalyse the hydration of cis-aconitate. However, 2-methylisocitrate and isocitrate were not substrates for AcnD, indicating that AcnD only catalyses the first half of the aconitase-like dehydration reactions [[cite:PUB00017755]]. The enzyme from the fungus Yarrowia lipolytica (Candida lipolytica) does not act on isocitrate. AcnD is homologous to aconitases A and B. In Escherichia coli, which lacks a member of this family, 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase activity was traced to aconitase B ([interpro:IPR004406]) [[cite:PUB00016694]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036008", "name" "Aconitase, iron-sulfur domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02333" "Fe/S-dependent 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase AcnD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-methylisocitrate dehydratase AcnD, Fe/S-dependent", "short" "2Me_IsoCit_deHydtase_FeS-dep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 826, "taxa" 4148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4357, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4357, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3344}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0240", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0240"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
