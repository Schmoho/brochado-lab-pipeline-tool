{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) family of proteins, exist in virtually all organisms, including bacteria and archaea. The SMC proteins are essential for successful chromosome transmission during replication and segregation of the genome in all organisms. They function together with other proteins in a range of chromosomal transactions, including chromosome condensation, sister-chromatid cohesion, recombination, DNA repair and epigenetic silencing of gene expression [[cite:PUB00007543]].</p>\n\n<p>SMCs are generally present as single proteins in bacteria, and as at least six distinct proteins in eukaryotes. The proteins range in size from approximately 110 to 170kDa, and share a five-domain structure, with globular N- and C-terminal domains separated by a long (circa 100 nm or 900 residues) coiled coil segment in the centre of which is a globular ''hinge'' domain, characterised by a set of four highly conserved glycine residues that are typical of flexible regions in a protein. The amino-terminal domain contains a 'Walker A' nucleotide-binding domain (GxxGxGKS/T), which has been shown by mutational studies to be essential in several proteins. The carboxy-terminal domain contains a sequence (the DA-box) that resembles a 'Walker B' motif (XXXXD, where X is any hydrophobic residue), and a LSGG motif with homology to the signature sequence of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of ATPases [[cite:PUB00007542]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the SMC protein from bacteria and archaea [[cite:PUB00015539], [cite:PUB00012621], [cite:PUB00015497]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01894" "Chromosome partition protein Smc [smc]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02169" "chromosome segregation protein SMC", "TIGR02168" "chromosome segregation protein SMC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Structural maintenance of chromosomes protein, prokaryotic", "short" "SMC_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7464, "taxa" 27642, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31174, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31174, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22515}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0201", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0201"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011890", :literature {"PUB00007543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Haering CH" "Lowe J" "Hochwagen A" "Nasmyth K."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
