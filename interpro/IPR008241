{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Isochorismate pyruvate-lyase (IPL; PchB) catalyses the second reaction in the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, conversion of isochorismate to salicylate plus pyruvate (following the initial PchA-dependent conversion of chorismate to isochorismate) [[cite:PUB00011071]]. This enzyme can also carry out the chorismate mutase (CM) reaction, but with a low catalytic efficiency. It is unlikely that PchB plays a significant role in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. This enzyme is a stand-alone version of a chorismate mutase domain of the AroQ class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three types of CM are AroQ class, prokaryotic type; AroQ class, eukaryotic type; and AroH class. They fall into two structural folds (AroQ class and AroH class) which are completely unrelated [[cite:PUB00011060]]. The two types of the AroQ structural class (the Escherichia coli CM dimer and the yeast CM monomer) can be structurally superimposed, and the topology of the four-helix bundle forming the active site is conserved [[cite:PUB00011060]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PchB-type of chorismate mutase domain, while sharing conserved residues and the predicted secondary structure with the other subgroups of the AroQ class (prokaryotic type), has isochorismate pyruvate-lyase (IPL) as a primary catalytic activity. PchB can still use the same active site either for the IPL or for the CM reaction. It has been suggested that PchB was derived from an AroQ-class CM by a gene duplication event followed by selection for efficient IPL function in the course of the evolution of the pyochelin siderophore pathway, with only residual CM activity remaining. It can be further speculated that contemporary CMs may already possess (weak) IPL activity [[cite:PUB00011072]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00011065], [cite:PUB00011066], [cite:PUB00011067]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ret", "name" "Salicylate and Pyruvate Bound Structure of the Isochorismate-Pyruvate Lyase K42E Mutant from Pseudomonas aerugionsa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036263", "name" "Chorismate mutase type II superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036979", "name" "Chorismate mutase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF029775" "Isochorismate pyruvate-lyase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01803" "chorismate mutase family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Salicylate biosynthesis protein PchB", "short" "Isochorismate_pyruvate-lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 539, "taxa" 2280, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1837, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1837, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1483}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1243", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1243"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
