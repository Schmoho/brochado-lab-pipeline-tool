Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase catalyzes the fourth step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine, the dehydratation of 2,3-dihydroxy-isovaleic acid into alpha-ketoisovaleric acid. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydratase catalyzes the first step in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the dehydratation of 6-phospho-D-gluconate into 6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate. Another protein containing this signature is the Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhG. The N-terminal part of the proteins contains a cysteine that could be involved in the binding of a 2Fe-2S iron-sulphur cluster [[cite:PUB00001841]].</p>\n\n<p>This family represents dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (DAD).
