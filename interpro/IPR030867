{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents tRNA(Phe) (4-demethylwyosine(37)-C(7)) aminocarboxypropyltransferase TYW2 from archaea. It is a s-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent transferase that acts as a component of the wyosine derivatives biosynthesis pathway. It catalyses the transfer of the alpha-amino-alpha-carboxypropyl (acp) group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to 4-demethylwyosine (imG-14), forming 7-aminocarboxypropyl-demethylwyosine (wybutosine-86) at position 37 of tRNA(Phe) [[cite:PUB00052807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01922" "tRNA(Phe) (4-demethylwyosine(37)-C(7)) aminocarboxypropyltransferase [taw2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA(Phe) (4-demethylwyosine(37)-C(7)) aminocarboxypropyltransferase", "short" "TYW2_archaea"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 120, "taxa" 794, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 669, "sets" 0, "proteins" 669, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 572}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
