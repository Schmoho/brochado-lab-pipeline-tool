{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lipoxygenases ([ec:1.13.11.-]) are a class of iron-containing dioxygenases which catalyses the hydroperoxidation of lipids, containing a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene structure. They are common in plants where they may be involved in a number of diverse aspects of plant physiology including growth and development, pest resistance, and senescence or responses to wounding. In mammals a number of lipoxygenases isozymes are involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins and leukotrienes [[cite:PUB00000045]]. Sequence data is available for the following lipoxygenases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plant lipoxygenases ([ec:1.13.11.12]). Plants express a variety of cytosolic isozymes as well as what seems to be a chloroplast isozyme [[cite:PUB00002887]].</li>\n<li>Mammalian arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ([ec:1.13.11.34]).</li>\n<li>Mammalian arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase ([ec:1.13.11.31]).</li>\n<li>Mammalian arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase B (also known as erythroid cell-specific 15-lipoxygenase; [ec:1.13.11.33]).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The iron atom in lipoxygenases is bound by four ligands, three of which are histidine residues [[cite:PUB00005162]]. Six histidines are conserved in all lipoxygenase sequences, five of them are found clustered in a stretch of 40 amino acids. This region contains two of the three iron-ligands; the other histidines have been shown [[cite:PUB00000363]] to be important for the activity of lipoxygenases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yge", "name" "LIPOXYGENASE-1 (SOYBEAN) AT 100K"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036226", "name" "Lipoxigenase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027433", "name" "Lipoxygenase, domain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11771" "LIPOXYGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipoxygenase", "short" "LipOase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 83, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1650, "taxa" 6633, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17355, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17355, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10469}, "pathways" 186}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
