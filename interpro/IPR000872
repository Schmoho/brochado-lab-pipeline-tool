{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes tafazzin and its homologues, such as Taz1 from yeasts and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine synthase from plants. Tafazzin is an enzyme involved in the cardiolipin remodelling pathway [[cite:PUB00070930], [cite:PUB00070931]]. The phospholipid cardiolipin is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane that is involved in mitochondrial energy production and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00070931]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans tafazzin is expressed at high levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle. As many as 10 isoforms can be present in different amounts in different tissues. Isoforms with hydrophobic N-termini are thought to be membrane anchored, while shorter forms, lacking the hydrophobic stretch, may be cytoplasmic (these latter are found in leukocytes and fibroblasts, but not in heart and skeletal muscle). A central hydrophilic domain may serve as an exposed loop that interacts with other proteins. Defects in the taz gene are the cause of Barth syndrome, a severe inherited disorder, often fatal in childhood. The disease is characterised by cardiac and skeletal myopathy, short stature and neutropenia [[cite:PUB00003900]].</p>\n\n<p>In flies tafazzin is a CoA-independent, acyl-specific phospholipid transacylase with substrate preference for cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine [[cite:PUB00070932]].</p>\n\n<p>Budding yeast Taz1 is a lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase that is required for normal phospholipid content of mitochondrial membranes, whose acyl specificity in the reaction relies on lipid chemical composition [[cite:PUB00070928], [cite:PUB00097835]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12497" "TAZ PROTEIN TAFAZZIN"}, "prints" {"PR00979" "TAFAZZIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tafazzin", "short" "Tafazzin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2211, "taxa" 8011, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5953, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3304}, "pathways" 228}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
