{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of enzymes catalyses the NADP(+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to form 2-oxoglutarate, CO2, and NADPH within the Krebs cycle ([ec:1.1.1.42]). Thus this enzyme supplies the cell with a key intermediate in energy metabolism, and precursors for biosynthetic pathways. The activity of this enzyme, which is controlled by phosphorylation, helps regulate carbon flux between the Krebs cycle and the glyoxylate bypass, which is an alternate route that accumulates carbon for biosynthesis when acetate is the sole carbon source for growth [[cite:PUB00017001]]. The phosphorylation state of this enzyme is controlled by isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase. This family has been found in a number of bacterial species including Azotobacter vinelandii, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Rhodomicrobium vannielii, and Neisseria meningitidis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure of isocitrate dehydrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii ([swissprot:P16100]) has been determined [[cite:PUB00017002]]. This molecule consists of two distinct domains, a small domain and a large domain, with a folding topology similar to that of dimeric isocitrate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli ([swissprot:P08200]). The structure of the large domain repeats a motif observed in the dimeric enzyme. Such a fusional structure by domain duplication enables a single polypeptide chain to form a structure at the catalytic site that is homologous to the dimeric enzyme, the catalytic site of which is located at the interface of two identical subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2b0t", "name" "Structure of Monomeric NADP Isocitrate dehydrogenase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36999" "ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE [NADP]"}, "pfam" {"PF03971" "Monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009407" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase, monomeric type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00178" "NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase NADP-dependent, monomeric", "short" "Isocitrate_DH_NADP_mono"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 3246, "taxa" 12689, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14393, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14363, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10982}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
