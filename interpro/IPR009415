{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Hadronyche versuta (Blue mountains funnel-web spider) specific omega-atracotoxin proteins. Omega-Atracotoxin-Hv1a is an insect-specific neurotoxin whose phylogenetic specificity derives from its ability to antagonise insect, but not vertebrate, voltage-gated calcium channels. Two spatially proximal residues, Asn(27) and Arg(35), form a contiguous molecular surface that is essential for toxin activity. It has been proposed that this surface of the Î²-hairpin is a key site for interaction of the toxin with insect calcium channels [[cite:PUB00012336]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06357" "Omega-atracotoxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Omega-atracotoxin", "short" "Omega-atracotox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 81, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 94, "sets" 0, "proteins" 94, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 89}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC60016", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC60016"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009415", :literature {"PUB00012336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["Tedford HW" "Fletcher JI" "King GF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
