{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of uncharacterised proteins found in alpha- and betaproteobacteria. Members of this protein family show sequence similarity, and apparently homology, to a family of integrative and conjugative element (ICE) proteins that has the founding member CrpP.
