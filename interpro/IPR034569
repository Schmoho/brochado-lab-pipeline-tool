{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) was first discovered based on its similarity to complex I in respiratory electron transport. However, it seems to be a ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reductase rather than an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Furthermore, it also comprises a subcomplex on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and a lumenal subcomplex [[cite:PUB00083364]].  The chloroplast NDH complex has been divided into four categories: membrane, lumen, A, and B subcomplexes. The subcomplex A and membrane subcomplex are conserved in cyanobacteria, but the subcomplex B and lumen subcomplex are specific to chloroplasts. PNSB5/ NDH18 is a subunit of subcomplex B [[cite:PUB00083728], [cite:PUB00083729]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36399" "PHOTOSYNTHETIC NDH SUBUNIT OF SUBCOMPLEX B 5, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosynthetic NDH subunit of subcomplex B 5, chloroplastic", "short" "PNSB5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 213, "taxa" 907, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 445, "sets" 0, "proteins" 445, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 293}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034569", :literature {"PUB00083364" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Ifuku K" "Endo T" "Shikanai T" "Aro EM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcr098", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "Structure of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex: nomenclature for nuclear-encoded subunits.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1560-8", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21785130}, "PUB00083728" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Peng L" "Fukao Y" "Fujiwara M" "Takami T" "Shikanai T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.109.068791", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Efficient operation of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase requires supercomplex formation with photosystem I via minor LHCI in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3623-40", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19903870}, "PUB00083729" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Peng L" "Yamamoto H" "Shikanai T."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
