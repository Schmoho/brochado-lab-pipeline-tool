{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of cyanobacterial proteins named CTB (Cyanobacterial Tandem Bacteriocin) as multiple family members can be encoded in tandem in a single genome. Members of this family, which average about 85 amino acids in length, resemble class II bacteriocins. They show N-terminal sequence similarity to bacteriocin leader peptide domain [interpro:IPR010133] and lack Cys residues (enriched in lanthipeptides as well as disulfide-forming bacteriocins) almost entirely. They are encoded next to homologues of families [interpro:IPR005897] and [interpro:IPR005696], involved in bacteriocin cleavage and export.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038167" "CTB family bacteriocin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyanobacterial tandem bacteriocin", "short" "CTB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 268, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 535, "sets" 0, "proteins" 535, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 365}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049891", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049891", "name" "Cyanobacterial tandem bacteriocin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
