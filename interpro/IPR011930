{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>FtsN is a poorly conserved protein active in cell division in a number of Proteobacteria. The N-terminal 30 residue region tends to by Lys/Arg-rich, and is followed by a membrane-spanning region. This is followed by an acidic low-complexity region of variable length and a well-conserved C-terminal domain of two tandem regions (Sporulation related repeat), found in several cell division and sporulation proteins. The role of FtsN as a suppressor for other cell division mutations is poorly understood; it may involve cell wall hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00015509]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02223" "cell division protein FtsN"}, "hamap" {"MF_02039" "Cell division protein FtsN [ftsN]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein FtsN", "short" "FtsN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 176, "taxa" 1513, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 4, "matches" 2134, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2118, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1667}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011930", :literature {"PUB00015509" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Errington J" "Daniel RA" "Scheffers DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
