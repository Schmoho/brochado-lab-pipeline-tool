{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including protein SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) and its paralogues from Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis, the SHI family comprises ten members. They contain a RING finger-like zinc finger motif. SHI may act as a negative regulator of GA responses through transcriptional control binding directly to the 5'-T/GCTCTAC-3' DNA motif found in the promoter regions [[cite:PUB00083348]]. In rice, it regulates tillering and panicle branching by modulating SPL14/IPA1 transcriptional activity on the downstream TB1 and DEP1 target genes [[cite:PUB00099606]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31604" "PROTEIN LATERAL ROOT PRIMORDIUM 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SHI protein family", "short" "SHI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 247, "taxa" 983, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3120, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3120, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1933}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007818", :literature {"PUB00083348" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Fridborg I" "Kuusk S" "Moritz T" "Sundberg E."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.11.6.1019", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The Arabidopsis dwarf mutant shi exhibits reduced gibberellin responses conferred by overexpression of a new putative zinc finger protein.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1019-32", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10368174}, "PUB00099606" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Duan E" "Wang Y" "Li X" "Lin Q" "Zhang T" "Wang Y" "Zhou C" "Zhang H" "Jiang L" "Wang J" "Lei C" "Zhang X" "Guo X" "Wang H" "Wan J."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1026-1042", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30914468}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007818", "name" "SHI protein family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
