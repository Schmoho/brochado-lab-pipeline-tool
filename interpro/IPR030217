{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mex67 is involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00071961]]. Vertebrate TAP (also called NXF1 for nuclear RNA export factor 1) is the orthologue of Mex67 [[cite:PUB00071960]]. TAP belongs to a multigene family with conserved modular architecture [[cite:PUB00018170]]. Other members of the family in humans are NXF2, NXF3, and NFX5. Both TAP(NXF1) and NXF2 bind mRNA and display RNA nuclear export activity [[cite:PUB00071970]]. NXF3 also has the ability to export mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but it uses a different mechanism [[cite:PUB00071958]]. NXF1 and NXF2 are predominantly nuclear, whereas the cytoplasmic presence of NXF3 and NXF5 suggests that they have a different cellular function [[cite:PUB00018170], [cite:PUB00071964]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three functional domains of TAP have been characterised: the RNA-binding domain, the Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, and the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The RNA-binding domain (RBD) of TAP is located at its amino terminus and is composed of two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and one leucine-rich region [[cite:PUB00071967], [cite:PUB00071968]]. Once bound to mRNA, TAP escorts the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) to the nuclear pore, where TAP interacts with nucleoporins via the NTF2-like (NTF2L) and UBA domains [[cite:PUB00026433]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jkg", "name" "Structural basis for the recognition of a nucleoporin FG-repeat by the NTF2-like domain of TAP-p15 mRNA nuclear export factor"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10662" "NUCLEAR RNA EXPORT FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear RNA export factor", "short" "NXF_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1874, "taxa" 6392, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5529, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3365}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030217", :literature {"PUB00071968" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Hautbergue GM" "Hung ML" "Golovanov AP" "Lian LY" "Wilson SA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
