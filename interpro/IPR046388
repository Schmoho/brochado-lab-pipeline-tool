{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the sliding-clamp-loader large subunit (also known as gp44) from Bacteriophage T4. It forms the sliding-clamp-loader together with the small subunit [[cite:PUB00100544]] and functions as an ATPase enzyme [[cite:PUB00100543], [cite:PUB00100545]]. The clamp loader holds the clamp in an open conformation and places it onto the DNA [[cite:PUB00100545], [cite:PUB00065743]]. ATP hydrolysis triggers the detachment of the sliding clamp from the sliding-clamp-loader, freeing the sliding clamp to track along DNA [[cite:PUB00100545], [cite:PUB00065743]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04162" "Sliding-clamp-loader large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sliding-clamp-loader large subunit", "short" "T4_Clamp_Loader_L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 197, "taxa" 1927, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1316, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1316, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 124}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
