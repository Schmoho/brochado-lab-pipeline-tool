{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta 1-5) constitute of a family of multi-functional cytokines that regulate cell growth and differentiation [[cite:PUB00007611]]. Many cells synthesise TGF-beta, and essentially all have specific receptors for this peptide [[cite:PUB00007612]]. TGF-beta regulates the actions of many other peptide growth factors and determines a positive or negative direction of their effects. The protein functions as a disulphide-linked homodimer. Its sequence is characterised by the presence of several C-terminal cysteine residues, which form interlocking disulphide links arranged in a knot-like topology. A similar cystine-knot arrangement has been noted in the structures of some enzyme inhibitors and neurotoxins that bind to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, although the precise topology differs.</p>\n\n<p>TGF-beta genes are expressed differentially, suggesting that the various TGF- beta species may have distinct physiological roles<i>in vivo</i>. Examination of TGF-beta 3 mRNA levels in adult murine tissues indicated that expression is predominant in brain, heart, adipose tissue and testis [[cite:PUB00007628]]. TGF beta-3 mRNA is also observed in adult mouse lung and placenta. Research on rat foetal lung fibroblasts has shown that exposure to cortisol increases TGF-beta 3 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that glucocorticoids may mediate their stimulatory effect on lung maturation by inducing TGF-beta 3 expression in foetal lung fibroblasts [[cite:PUB00007629]].</p>\n\n<p>The three-dimensional structures of several members of the TGF-beta superfamily have been deduced. The crystal structure of TGF-beta 3 reveals a near identical central core to that of TGF-beta 2 [[cite:PUB00007613]]. The principal differences are witnessed in the conformations of the N-terminal α-helix and in the β-sheet loops, which could account for the individual cellular responses, if these differences are recognised by the TGF-beta receptors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01426" "TGFBETA3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transforming growth factor beta-3", "short" "TGFB3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 622, "taxa" 2088, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7825, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1005, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 713}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015618", :literature {"PUB00007611" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Archer SJ" "Bax A" "Roberts AB" "Sporn MB" "Ogawa Y" "Piez KA" "Weatherbee JA" "Tsang ML" "Lucas R" "Zheng BL."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00055a021", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Transforming growth factor beta 1: NMR signal assignments of the recombinant protein expressed and isotopically enriched using Chinese hamster ovary cells.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "1152-63", "volume" "32", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8424942}, "PUB00007612" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Cheifetz S" "Weatherbee JA" "Tsang ML" "Anderson JK" "Mole JE" "Lucas R" "Massague J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(87)90192-9", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "The transforming growth factor-beta system, a complex pattern of cross-reactive ligands and receptors.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "409-15", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2879635}, "PUB00007628" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Miller DA" "Lee A" "Matsui Y" "Chen EY" "Moses HL" "Derynck R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
