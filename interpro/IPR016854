{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ced-4 is a family of apoptosis proteins from nematodes. Caenorhabditis elegans has three genes, ced-3, ced-4 and ced-9, which code for the components of an induction pathway of apoptosis that is conserved in the nematode and mammals. Homologues in have also been found in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00043497]]. Egl-1 binds to and directly inhibits the activity of ced-9, releasing the cell death activator ced-4 from a ced-9/ced-4 containing protein complex. This allows ced-4 to activate the cell-killing caspase ced-3 [[cite:PUB00153724]]. It regulates CEP neuron apoptosis in response to high Al3+ levels [[cite:PUB00153727]]. It may regulate germline apoptosis in response to DNA damage, probably downstream of let-60/ras and mpk-1 pathway [[cite:PUB00153725], [cite:PUB00153726]]. During larval development, Ced-4 is required for the elimination of transient presynaptic components downstream of egl-1 and ced-9 and upstream of ced-3 apoptotic pathway [[cite:PUB00153729]]. It has also been described that, together with ain-1, it is a component of the miRNA-induced-silencing complex (miRISC), and probably upstream of ced-3, regulates temporal cell fate patterning during larval development [[cite:PUB00153728]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death (PCD), is a common and evolutionarily conserved property of all metazoans [[cite:PUB00017281]]. In many biological processes, apoptosis is required to eliminate supernumerary or dangerous (such as pre-cancerous) cells and to promote normal development. Dysregulation of apoptosis can, therefore, contribute to the development of many major diseases including cancer, autoimmunity and neurodegenerative disorders.
