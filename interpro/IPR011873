{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the 40 members of a paralogous protein family in the rumen anaerobe Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, and a smaller number in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100. Member proteins are about 270 residues long and appear to lack signal sequences and transmembrane helices. The only perfectly conserved residue is a glycine in an otherwise poorly conserved region, suggesting members are not enzymes. The family is not characterised.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02147" "TIGR02147 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP02147", "short" "CHP02147"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 309, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2246, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2246, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1744}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011873", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR011873", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP02147", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
