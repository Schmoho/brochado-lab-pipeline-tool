{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of integral membrane proteins. CtaA (also known as heme A synthase) is required for cytochrome aa3 oxidase assembly in Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00008248]]. COX15 is required for cytochrome c oxidase assembly [[cite:PUB00070779]], and is involved in the synthesis of heme A [[cite:PUB00070778], [cite:PUB00097267], [cite:PUB00097268]]. COX15 forms highly stable complexes through hydrophobic interactions, and this multimerization is evolutionarily conserved, independent of heme levels and heme a synthase catalytic activity. There are four conserved histidine residues critical for eukaryotic heme a synthase activity [[cite:PUB00097268]].
