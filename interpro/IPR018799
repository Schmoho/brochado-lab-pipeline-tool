{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TRAF3-interacting protein 1 (TRAF3IP1, also known as IFT54) recruits TRAF3 (tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3) and DISC1 (Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1) to the microtubules and is conserved from worms to humans [[cite:PUB00063569]]. The N-terminal region is the microtubule binding domain and is well-conserved; the C-terminal 100 residues, also well-conserved, constitute the coiled-coil region which binds to TRAF3. The central region of the protein is rich in lysine and glutamic acid and carries KKE motifs which may also be necessary for tubulin-binding, but this region is the least well-conserved [[cite:PUB00044362]]. In humans, it plays an inhibitory role on IL13 signaling by binding to IL13RA1. It is involved in suppression of IL13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, transcriptional activity and DNA-binding [[cite:PUB00044362], [cite:PUB00063570]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5fmu", "name" "MmIFT54 CH-domain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042576", "name" "TRAF3-interacting protein 1, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31363" "TRAF3-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TRAF3-interacting protein 1", "short" "TRAF3IP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 924, "taxa" 4091, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2429, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1494}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018799", :literature {"PUB00063569" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Morris JA" "Kandpal G" "Ma L" "Austin CP."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
