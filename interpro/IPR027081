They are cyclins that play a role in cell cycle. They are also subunits forming the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor. Human cyclin-H regulates CDK7, the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) enzymatic complex [[cite:PUB00069500]]. mcs2 posseses kinase activity that can be detected when myelin basic protein (MBP) is provided as an exogenous substrate [[cite:PUB00069499]]. Ccl1 is a regulatory component of the TFIIK complex, which is the protein kinase component of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). TFIIH  is essential for both basal and activated transcription and is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA and in polymerase II transcription [[cite:PUB00062852]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8p79", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of CAK with averaged inhibitor density"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00569" "cyclin ccl1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CyclinH/Ccl1", "short" "CyclinH/Ccl1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 849, "taxa" 3553, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1551, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1551, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1077}, "pathways" 108}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2049", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2049"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027081", :literature {"PUB00069499" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Molz L" "Beach D."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Characterization of the fission yeast mcs2 cyclin and its associated protein kinase activity.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "1723-32", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8467814}, "PUB00062852" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Feaver WJ" "Henry NL" "Wang Z" "Wu X" "Svejstrup JQ" "Bushnell DA" "Friedberg EC" "Kornberg RD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
