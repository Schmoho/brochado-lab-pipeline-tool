{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small family of single-pass membrane proteins described as small integral membrane proteins, including SMIM5/18/22 which have been described as variants of the Cancer-Associated Small Integral Membrane Open reading frame 1 (CASIMO1), a small open reading frame (sORF)-encoded protein (also known as a microprotein). CASIMO1 controls cell proliferation and interacts with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) modulating lipid droplet formation. CASIMO1 RNA is overexpressed predominantly in hormone receptor-positive breast tumors, and its knockdown has been shown to decrease proliferation in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Loss of CASIMO1 disturbs the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, leads to inhibition of cell motility, and stalls the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. CASIMO1 interacts with SQLE, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and a known oncogene in breast cancer [[cite:PUB00102005]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15831" "Small integral membrane protein 5/18/22"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small integral membrane protein 5/18/22", "short" "SMIM5/18/22"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 620, "taxa" 2093, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1661, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1660, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1184}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031671", :literature {"PUB00102005" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Polycarpou-Schwarz M" "Gro√ü M" "Mestdagh P" "Schott J" "Grund SE" "Hildenbrand C" "Rom J" "Aulmann S" "Sinn HP" "Vandesompele J" "Diederichs S."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "The cancer-associated microprotein CASIMO1 controls cell proliferation and interacts with squalene epoxidase modulating lipid droplet formation.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "4750-4768", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29765154}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031671", "name" "Small integral membrane protein 5/18/22", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR047133", "name" "Small integral membrane protein 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 10, "alignment:full" 1345}}}
