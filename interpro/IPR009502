{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial Secretion monitor precursor (SecM) proteins. SecM is known to regulate SecA expression by translational coupling of the secM secA operon. Translational pausing at a specific Pro residue 5 residues before the end of the protein may allow disruption of a mRNA repressor helix that normally suppresses secA translation initiation. The eubacterial protein secretion machinery consists of a number of soluble and membrane associated components. One critical element is SecA ATPase, which acts as a molecular motor to promote protein secretion at translocation sites that consist of SecYE, the SecA receptor, and SecG and SecDFyajC proteins, which regulate SecA membrane cycling [[cite:PUB00012653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8qoa", "name" "Structure of SecM-stalled Escherichia coli 70S ribosome"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01332" "Secretion monitor [secM]"}, "pfam" {"PF06558" "Secretion monitor precursor protein (SecM)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004572" "Secretion monitor SecM"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secretion monitor", "short" "SecM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 132, "taxa" 1218, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1411, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1410, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1061}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009502", :literature {"PUB00012653" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Sarker S" "Rudd KE" "Oliver D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
