{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Syntaxins are the prototype family of SNARE proteins. They usually consist of three main regions - a C-terminal transmembrane region, a central SNARE domain which is characteristic of and conserved in all syntaxins [interpro:IPR000727], and an N-terminal domain which varies between syntaxin isoforms; in syntaxin 1A ([swissprot:O35526]) it is found as three Î±-helices with a left-handed twist. It may fold back on the SNARE domain to allow the molecule to adopt a 'closed' configuration that prevents formation of the core fusion complex - it thus has an auto-inhibitory role.</p>\n\n<p>The function of syntaxins is determined by their localisation. They are involved in neuronal exocytosis, ER-Golgi transport and Golgi-endosome transport, for example. They also interact with other proteins as well as those involved in SNARE complexes. These include vesicle coat proteins, Rab GTPases, and tethering factors [[cite:PUB00020397]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5w5c", "name" "Crystal structure of the primed SNARE-Complexin-Synaptotagmin-1 C2AB complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010989", "name" "SNARE", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19957" "SYNTAXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Syntaxin", "short" "Syntaxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2733, "taxa" 9981, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40124, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25793}, "pathways" 126}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045242", :literature {"PUB00020397" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Teng FY" "Wang Y" "Tang BL."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11737951", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The syntaxins.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS3012", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11737951}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045242", "name" "Syntaxin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
