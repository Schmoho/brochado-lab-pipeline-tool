{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Drosophila melanogaster, Nanos functions as a localised determinant of posterior pattern. Nanos RNA is localised to the posterior pole of the maturing egg cell and encodes a protein that emanates from this localised source. Nanos acts as a translational repressor and thereby establishes a gradient of the morphogen Hunchback [[cite:PUB00011394]]. Nanos comprises a non-conserved amino-terminus and highly conserved carboxy- terminal regions. The C-terminal region has two conserved Cys-Cys-His-Cys (CCHC)-type zinc-finger motifs that are indispensable for nanos function [[cite:PUB00055538]]. Xcat-2 from Xenopus encodes a protein with a nanos-like zinc finger domain. It is found in the vegetal cortical region and is inherited by the vegetal blasomeres during development, and is degraded very early in development. The localised and maternally restricted expression of Xcat-2 RNA suggests a role for its protein in setting up regional differences in gene expression that occur early in development [[cite:PUB00011395]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry consists of the Nanos protein and homologues, including Xcat-2.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038129", "name" "Nanos domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12887" "NANOS PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nanos/Xcat2", "short" "Nanos/Xcar2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 809, "taxa" 3545, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1813}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008705", :literature {"PUB00055538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Hashimoto H" "Hara K" "Hishiki A" "Kawaguchi S" "Shichijo N" "Nakamura K" "Unzai S" "Tamaru Y" "Shimizu T" "Sato M."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO Rep.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/embor.2010.155", "medline_journal" "EMBO Rep", "title" "Crystal structure of zinc-finger domain of Nanos and its functional implications.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "848-53", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20948543}, "PUB00011395" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Mosquera L" "Forristall C" "Zhou Y" "King ML."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/1/377", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "A mRNA localized to the vegetal cortex of Xenopus oocytes encodes a protein with a nanos-like zinc finger domain.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "377-86", "volume" "117", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8223259}, "PUB00011394" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Curtis D" "Apfeld J" "Lehmann R."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/121/6/1899", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "nanos is an evolutionarily conserved organizer of anterior-posterior polarity.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "1899-910", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7601003}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008705", "name" "Nanos/Xcat2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
