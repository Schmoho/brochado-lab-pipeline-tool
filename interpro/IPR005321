{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of serine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family S58 (DmpA aminopeptidase family, clan PE). The protein fold of the peptidase unit for members of this family resembles that of archaean proteasome subunit B, the type example of clan PB. The type example is aminopeptidase DmpA from Ochrobactrum anthropi. This family also contains proteins that have been found experimentally to be without peptidase activity, or lack amino acid residues that are believed to be essential for the catalytic activity of peptidases in the family.</p>\n\n<p>L-aminopeptidase D-Ala-esterase/amidase (DmpA) from O. anthropi releases the N-terminal L and/or D-Ala residues from peptide substrates. This is the only known enzyme to liberate N-terminal amino acids with both D and L stereospecificity. DmpA active form is an alphabeta heterodimer, which results from a putative autocatalytic cleavage of an inactive precursor polypeptide. DmpA shows structural homology to N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase family members, and may work by a similar catalytic mechanism, however their secondary structure elements differ significantly [[cite:PUB00015067]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n2w", "name" "Crystal structure of the N-terminal beta-aminopeptidase BapA from Sphingosinicella xenopeptidilytica"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016117", "name" "ArgJ-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36512" "D-AMINOPEPTIDASE"}, "pfam" {"PF03576" "Peptidase family S58"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S58, DmpA", "short" "Peptidase_S58_DmpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 59, "proteomes" 4083, "taxa" 15162, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20924, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15863}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
