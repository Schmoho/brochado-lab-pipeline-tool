{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacterial and archaeal isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IPP isomerase). IPP isomerase catalyses the interconversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), and is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids via the mevalonate pathway.  The bacterial and archaeal IPP isomerase (type 2 enzyme) differs from that found in eukaryotes (type 1 enzyme), and requires NADPH, magnesium, and FMN for activity [[cite:PUB00014546], [cite:PUB00014547]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1p0k", "name" "IPP:DMAPP isomerase type II apo structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02811" "IDI-2_FMN"}, "panther" {"PTHR43665" "ISOPENTENYL-DIPHOSPHATE DELTA-ISOMERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00354" "Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase [fni]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003314" "Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, FMN-dependent"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02151" "type 2 isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, FMN-dependent", "short" "IPdP_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1898, "taxa" 9112, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9832, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9832, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7569}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0758", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0758"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
