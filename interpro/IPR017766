{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the proteins sphingomyelinase C ([ec:3.1.4.12]) and phospholipase C ([ec:3.1.4.3]). Sphingomyelinase (also known as sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase) is a hydrolase enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism, breaking down sphingomyelin to phosphocholine and ceramide [[cite:PUB00042945]]. However, some of these enzymes act as haemolysins, virulence factors that promotes intracellular proliferation by mediating the disruption of the phagocytic vacuole and the release of bacteria into the host cell cytosol. It may act in concert with the phospholipases PlcA and PlcB and the hemolysin Hly to mediate efficient escape from the vacuole [[cite:PUB00044692]]. Phospholipase C is a bacterial haemolysin, which are exotoxins that attack blood cell membranes and cause cell rupture. Beta-haemolysin is a phospholipase C with specific activity toward sphingomyelins, and has a high specificity for sphingomyelin [[cite:PUB00044693]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ddr", "name" "Crystal structure of sphingomyelinase from Bacillus cereus with calcium ion"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036691", "name" "Endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03395" "sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase"}, "cdd" {"cd09078" "Neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMase) catalyze the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in biological membranes to ceramide and phosphorylcholine"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sphingomyelinase C/phospholipase C", "short" "Sphingomyelinase/PLipase_C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1188, "taxa" 4689, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3811, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3802, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2583}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
