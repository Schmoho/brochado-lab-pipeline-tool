{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lantibiotics form a class of antimicrobial peptides that are ribosomally synthesized as precursor peptides and then post-translationally modified [[cite:PUB00081567], [cite:PUB00081568], [cite:PUB00081569], [cite:PUB00081570]]. Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified to contain thioether cross-links called lanthionines (Lans) or methyllanthionines (MeLans) in addition to  2,3-didehydroalanine (Dha) and (Z)-2,3-didehydrobutyrine (Dhb). These unusual amino acids are introduced by the dehydration of serine and threonine residues, followed by thioether formation via addition of cysteine thiols, catalysed by LanB and LanC or LanM. Class I lantibiotics possess two modification enzymes, i.e. a dehydratase LanB and a cyclase LanC. Class II lantibiotics are modified by a bi-functional enzyme called LanM, which is able to perform both the dehydration and the cyclization reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LanC is the cyclase enzyme of the lanthionine synthetase. Lanthinoine is a class I lantibiotic. LanC, the cyclase component, is a zinc metalloprotein, whose bound metal has been proposed to activate the thiol substrate for nucleophilic addition. This family also contains the cyclases involved in the biosynthesis of subtilin (SpaC) [[cite:PUB00046081]], nisin (NisC) [[cite:PUB00040886]] and homologues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8byk", "name" "The structure of MadC from Clostridium maddingley reveals new insights into class I lanthipeptide cyclases"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04793" "Cyclases involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotics"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type I lantibiotic biosynthesis cyclase", "short" "LanC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 500, "taxa" 1971, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1988, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1988, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1514}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033889", :literature {"PUB00046081" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Okeley NM" "Paul M" "Stasser JP" "Blackburn N" "van der Donk WA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi0354942", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "SpaC and NisC, the cyclases involved in subtilin and nisin biosynthesis, are zinc proteins.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "13613-24", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14622008}, "PUB00040886" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5766", "authors" ["Li B" "Yu JP" "Brunzelle JS" "Moll GN" "van der Donk WA" "Nair SK."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1121422", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structure and mechanism of the lantibiotic cyclase involved in nisin biosynthesis.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1464-7", "volume" "311", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16527981}, "PUB00081567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Nagao J" "Asaduzzaman SM" "Aso Y" "Okuda K" "Nakayama J" "Sonomoto K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
