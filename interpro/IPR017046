{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents prenylcysteine oxidases (also known as prenylcysteine lyases) and homologues that are predicted to have the same function. The human enzyme is part of the lysosome and functions in the degradation of prenylated proteins, cleaving the thioether bond of prenyl-L-cysteines, such as farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine [[cite:PUB00043271], [cite:PUB00100793]]. More recently, prenylcysteine oxidase 1 (PCYOX1) has been found in apoB100-containing lipoproteins, having pro-oxidant activity. It may contribute to development of atherosclerosis, as it is able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, therefore, contribute lipoproteins oxidation [[cite:PUB00100793], [cite:PUB00100794]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15944" "FARNESYLCYSTEINE LYASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036292" "Prenylcysteine oxidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prenylcysteine oxidase 1", "short" "Prenylcysteine_Oxase1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2234, "taxa" 7432, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4861, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4797, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3135}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
