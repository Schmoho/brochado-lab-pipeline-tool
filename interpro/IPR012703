{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphonates are a class of organophosphorus compounds, characterised by a stable C-P bond, which are found in a variety of biologically produced molecules including antiobiotics, lipids, proteins and polysaccharides [[cite:PUB00033214]]. The functions of these molecules include phosphorus storage, cell communication, host recognition and chemical warfare. 2-Aminoethylphosphonate (AEP), the most common naturally occurring phosphonate, is an important precursor used in the biosynthesis of phosphonolipids, phosphonoproteins, and phosphonoglycans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents 2-aminoethylphosphonate-pyruvate transaminase (AEPT) ([ec:2.6.1.37]) which catalyses the interconversion of AEP and phosphonoacetaldehyde (P-Ald), coupled with the interconversion of pryuvate and L-alanine. In some bacterial species this is the first step in an AEP degradation pathway which allows them to utilise this compound as a source of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Phosphonoacetaldeyhde hydrolase, often encoded by an adjacent gene, then converts P-Ald to acetaldehyde and phosphate. Species with this pathway generally have an identified phosphonate ABC transporter but do not also have the multisubunit C-P lyase complex as found in Escherichia coli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crystal structure of AEPT from Salmonella typhimurium has been studied to 2.2 A resolution [[cite:PUB00027210]]. The protein is a homodimer where each subunit is composed of two domains, large and small. The large domain forms an α-β complex characteristic of the aspartate transaminase family, while the small domain is composed of highly twisted β strands. The active site contains a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor and is found at the domain interface, being composed of residues from both subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6pd2", "name" "PntC-AEPT: fusion protein of phosphonate-specific cytidylyltransferase and 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) transaminase from Treponema denticola in complex with cytidine monophosphate-AEP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01376" "2-aminoethylphosphonate--pyruvate transaminase [phnW]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03301" "2-aminoethylphosphonate aminotransferase", "TIGR02326" "2-aminoethylphosphonate--pyruvate transaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-aminoethylphosphonate--pyruvate transaminase", "short" "NH2EtPonate_pyrv_transaminase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1008, "taxa" 5987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6420, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6420, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4846}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0724", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0724"} {"accession" "GenProp0713", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0713"} {"accession" "GenProp0238", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0238"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
