{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes enzymes primarily involved in the biosynthesis of complex lipids with methyl-branched fatty acids, such us Phthioceranic/hydroxyphthioceranic acid synthase [[cite:PUB00106224], [cite:PUB00155020]] and Mycocerosic acid synthase-like polyketide synthase from Mycobacterium sp. These lipids are significant components of the cell envelope in certain bacteria and play a role in host-pathogen interactions [[cite:PUB00155021]]. Members of this family function as polyketide synthases that catalyse the elongation of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA with methylmalonyl-CoA to form various methyl-branched fatty acids. These fatty acids are key constituents of sulfolipids and other polyacylated molecules, which are crucial for the virulence and survival of the bacteria within the host. The enzymes exhibit a domain organization that includes a condensing ketosynthase-acyltransferase region and a modifying dehydratase-keto reductase-enoyl reductase-keto reductase region, often followed by an acyl carrier protein domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041183" "sulfolipid-1 biosynthesis phthioceranic/hydroxyphthioceranic acid synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyl-branched fatty acid synthase", "short" "MBFA_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 373, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 658, "sets" 0, "proteins" 658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13}, "pathways" 221}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
