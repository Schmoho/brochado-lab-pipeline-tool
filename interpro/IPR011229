{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains GpsB (also known as YpsB), which is a cell cycle protein and a component of the divisome. It associates with the complex late in its assembly, after the Z-ring is formed, and is dependent on DivIC and PBP2B for its recruitment to the divisome. Together with EzrA, it is a key component of the system that regulates PBP1 localization during cell cycle progression. Its main role could be the removal of PBP1 from the cell pole after pole maturation is completed. GpsB also contributes to the recruitment of PBP1 to the division complex and is not essential for septum formation [[cite:PUB00070823], [cite:PUB00070824]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8e2b", "name" "N-terminal domain of S. aureus GpsB"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02011" "Cell cycle protein GpsB [gpsB]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029938" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP029938 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell cycle protein GpsB", "short" "Cell_cycle_GpsB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 706, "taxa" 2812, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2564, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2048}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011229", :literature {"PUB00070823" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Claessen D" "Emmins R" "Hamoen LW" "Daniel RA" "Errington J" "Edwards DH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
