{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phf5 is a member of a novel murine multigene family that is highly conserved during evolution and belongs to the superfamily of PHD-finger proteins. At least one example, from Mus musculus (mouse), may act as a chromatin-associated protein [[cite:PUB00020106]]. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) ini1 gene is essential, required for splicing [[cite:PUB00020105]]. It is localised in the nucleus, but not detected in the nucleolus and can be complemented by human ini1 [[cite:PUB00020105]]. The proteins of this family contain five CXXC motifs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5syb", "name" "Crystal structure of human PHF5A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03660" "PHF5-like protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016468" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor RDS3"}, "panther" {"PTHR13120" "PHD FINGER-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PHF5-like", "short" "PHF5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 64, "domain_architectures" 74, "proteomes" 2379, "taxa" 8277, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3911, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3874, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2593}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005345", :literature {"PUB00020106" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 6", "authors" ["Oltra E" "Verde F" "Werner R" "D'Urso G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
