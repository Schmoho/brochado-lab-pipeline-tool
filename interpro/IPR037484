{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Bacillus subtilis AmhX and related proteins that form a subfamily of the peptidase M20 family [[cite:PUB00087032]]. They are predicted amidohydrolases. These are a class of zinc binding homodimeric enzymes involved in hydrolysis of N-acetylated proteins [[cite:PUB00030157]]. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process that is involved in protection and stability of proteins. Several types of aminoacylases can be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity. Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) breaks down cytosolic aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids (except L-aspartate), especially N-acetyl-methionine and acetyl-glutamate into L-amino acids and an acyl group. However, ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. ACY1 may also play a role in xenobiotic bioactivation as well as the inter-organ processing of amino acid-conjugated xenobiotic derivatives (S-substituted-N-acetyl-L-cysteine) [[cite:PUB00081397]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08018" "M20 Peptidase aminoacylase 1 amhX-like subfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AmhX-like", "short" "AmhX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 200, "taxa" 855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 918, "sets" 0, "proteins" 918, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 665}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
