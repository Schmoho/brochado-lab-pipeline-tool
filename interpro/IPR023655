{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c (CytC) proteins can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes.</p>\n\n<p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC.</p>\n\n<p>Class I includes the low-spin soluble CytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the haem-attachment site towards the N terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C terminus. On the basis of sequence similarity, class I CytC were further subdivided into five classes, IA to IE. Class IC, 'split-alpha-band' Cyt C, possess a widened or split alpha-band of lowered absorptivity. This class includes dihaem Cyt C4 and monohaem Cyt C6 (Cyt C-553) and Cyt C-554.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Cyt C6 [[cite:PUB00003350]] and Desulfovibrio vulgaris Cyt C-553 [[cite:PUB00002343]] have been determined.
