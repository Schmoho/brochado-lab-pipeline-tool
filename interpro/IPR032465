{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase, also known as picolinate carboxylase or ACMSD, is a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily involved in tryptophan metabolism [[cite:PUB00076371], [cite:PUB00076373]]. It converts alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde (ACMS) to alpha-aminomuconate semialdehyde (AMS). ACMSD has medical importance as its substrate ACMS is unstable and dehydrates to quinolinic acid (QUIN, QA), not only a key precursor of NAD, but also a potent neurotoxin  [[cite:PUB00076372]]. Elevated levels of QUIN have been observed in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions [[cite:PUB00076368], [cite:PUB00076369], [cite:PUB00076370]].</p>\n\n<p>The entry also includes decarboxylases  OrsB, MacB and YanB, and salicylate decarboxylase.</p>\n\n<p>YanB is a decarboxylase and part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of yanuthone D, a fungal isoprenoid epoxycyclohexenone that acts as an antibiotic against fungi and bacteria [[cite:PUB00083261]]. Salicylate decarboxylase has been shown to catalyse both the decarboxylation of salicylic acid to produce phenol, and the carboxylation of phenol to form salicylic acid [[cite:PUB00086569]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ofc", "name" "2.0 Angstroms X-ray crystal structure of human 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehye decarboxylase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21240" "2-AMINO-3-CARBOXYLMUCONATE-6-SEMIALDEHYDE DECARBOXYLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase", "short" "ACMSD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 85, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7008, "taxa" 26123, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 83009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 83009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 60341}, "pathways" 98}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
