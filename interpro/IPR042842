{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CD226, also known as DNAM-1, is a nectin receptor that contains two extracellular Ig-like domains (CD226-D1 and CD226-D2), and is widely expressed in monocytes, platelets, T cells, and most of the resting NK cells. The interactions between CD226 and its nectin/Necl family ligands, CD155 (also known as Necl-5) and CD112 (nectin-2), play important roles in modulating NK cell adhesion and cytotoxicity, facilitating immunological synapse formation and promoting cytokine secretion during inflammation [[cite:PUB00093435], [cite:PUB00093436], [cite:PUB00093437]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6isa", "name" "mCD226"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47011" "CD226 ANTIGEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CD226 antigen", "short" "CD226"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 372, "taxa" 1473, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 750, "sets" 0, "proteins" 750, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 449}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042842", :literature {"PUB00093437" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Deuss FA" "Watson GM" "Goodall KJ" "Leece I" "Chatterjee S" "Fu Z" "Thaysen-Andersen M" "Andrews DM" "Rossjohn J" "Berry R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
