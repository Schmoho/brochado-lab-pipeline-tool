{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Salmonella typhimurium LT2, under anaerobic conditions, CobU ([ec:2.7.7.62] and [ec:2.7.1.156]), CobT ([ec:2.4.2.21]), CobC ([ec:3.1.3.73]) and CobS ([ec:2.7.8.26]) catalyse reactions in the nucleotide loop assembly pathway, which convert adenosylcobinamide (AdoCbi) into adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). CobT and CobC are involved in 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole activation whereby 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is converted into its riboside, alpha-ribazole. The second branch of the nuclotide loop assembly pathway is the cobinamide (Cbi) activation branch where AdoCbi or adenosylcobinamide-phosphate is converted into the activated intermediate AdoCbi-GDP by the bifunctional enzyme CobU. CobS catalyses the final step in adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis, which is the condensation of AdoCbi-GDP with alpha-ribazole to yield adenosylcobalamin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this entry include the known CobC protein of Salmonella and Escherichia coli species, and homologous proteins found in cobalamin biosynthesis regions in other bacteria. CobC  is alpha-ribazole phosphatase ([ec:3.1.3.73]) and, like many phosphatases, can be closely related in sequence to other phosphatases with different functions. Close homologues excluded from this entry include proteins with duplications.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029033", "name" "Histidine phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03162" "alpha-ribazole phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-ribazole phosphatase, CobC", "short" "Ribazole_CobC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 652, "taxa" 3610, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3429, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2721}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0269", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0269"} {"accession" "GenProp1454", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1454"} {"accession" "GenProp1349", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1349"} {"accession" "GenProp1378", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1378"} {"accession" "GenProp1366", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1366"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
