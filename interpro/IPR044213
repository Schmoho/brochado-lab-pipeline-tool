{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of pentapeptide repeat containing proteins (PRPs) from plants and cyanobacteria, including At2g44920 (also known as p15) from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00095509]]. PRP structures are dominated by four-sided right-handed β-helices typically consisting of mixtures of type II and type IV β-turns. At2g44920 is a thylakoid lumenal protein that consists of 25 pentapeptide repeats capped by N- and C-terminal α-helices. Unlike other PRPs, At2g44920 consists exclusively of type II β-turns [[cite:PUB00095508]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n90", "name" "The 1.7 Angstrom resolution crystal structure of AT2G44920, a pentapeptide repeat protein from Arabidopsis thaliana thylakoid lumen."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47200" "THYLAKOID LUMENAL 15 KDA PROTEIN 1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thylakoid lumenal 15kDa protein 1-like", "short" "At2g44920-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 611, "taxa" 3521, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3573, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3573, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2464}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044213", :literature {"PUB00095508" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Xu S" "Ni S" "Kennedy MA."], "ISO_journal" "Biophys.
