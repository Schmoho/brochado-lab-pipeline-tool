{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phage integrases are enzymes that mediate unidirectional site-specific recombination between two DNA recognition sequences, the phage attachment site, attP, and the bacterial attachment site, attB [[cite:PUB00014061]]. Integrases may be grouped into two major families, the tyrosine recombinases and the serine recombinases, based on their mode of catalysis. Tyrosine family integrases, such as Bacteriophage lambda integrase, utilise a catalytic tyrosine to mediate strand cleavage, tend to recognise longer attP sequences, and require other proteins encoded by the phage or the host bacteria.</p>\r\n<p>The recombinases Cre from phage P1, XerD from Escherichia coli and Flp from yeast are members of the tyrosine recombinase family, and have a two-domain motif resembling that of lambda integrase, as well as sharing a conserved binding mechanism [[cite:PUB00014062]]. The structural fold of their catalytic core domains resemble that of Lambda integrase</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry contains XerD-like putative tyrosine recombinases from the Streptococcaceae family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011010", "name" "DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme, catalytic core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013762", "name" "Integrase-like, catalytic domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01817" "Tyrosine recombinase XerD-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine recombinase XerD-like", "short" "Tyrosine_recombinase_XerD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 35, "taxa" 351, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 601, "sets" 0, "proteins" 601, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 483}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020876", :literature {"PUB00014061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Groth AC" "Calos MP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
