{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents neuropeptides that are the first members of the insect kinin-family isolated from the American cockroach. Their occurrence in the retrocerebral complex suggests a physiological role as a neurohormone. The C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Ser-Trp-Gly-NH2 characterised the peptides as members of the insect kinin family. Data suggest a possible involvement of insect kinins in water-balance by regulating the osmoregulation. Insect kinins also mediate visceral muscle contractile activity (myotropic activity) [[cite:PUB00017097]]. These peptides have lengths ranging from 6 to 14 amino acids [[cite:PUB00017097]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08260" "Insect kinin peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kinin peptide", "short" "Kinin_peptide"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 31, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013202", :literature {"PUB00017097" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Predel R" "Kellner R" "Rapus J" "Penzlin H" "Gade G."], "ISO_journal" "Regul.
