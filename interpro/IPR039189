{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Fcp1 and its homologues, including CTDP1 from humans and CPL1/2/3/4/5 from Arabidopsis. They are carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatases. CPL1 has been shown to interact with two NMD (nonsense-mediated decay) factors, eIF4AIII and UPF3, and is involved in the dephosphorylation of eIF4AIII [[cite:PUB00089263]]. CPL4 functions as a pol II CTD phosphatase and has been shown to dephosphorylate both Ser2- and Ser5-PO(4) of CTD in vitro [[cite:PUB00089264]]. Budding yeast Fcp1 has been shown to dephosphorylate RNA polymerase (RNAP) II subunit, and this interaction is modulated by the Pin1 protein [[cite:PUB00089265]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xpz", "name" "Structure of fission yeast RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatase Fcp1-R271A bound to aluminum fluoride"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23081" "RNA POLYMERASE II CTD PHOSPHATASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CTD phosphatase Fcp1", "short" "Fcp1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2583, "taxa" 8846, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8583, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5111}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
