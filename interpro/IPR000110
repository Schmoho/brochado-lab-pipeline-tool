{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The small ribosomal subunit protein bS1 (also known as 30S ribosomal protein S1) [[cite:PUB00006481]] contains the S1 domain that has been found in a large number of RNA-associated proteins. bS1 is a prominent component of the Escherichia coli ribosome and is most probably required for translation of most, if not all, natural mRNAs in E. coli in vivo [[cite:PUB00006418], [cite:PUB00151100]]. It binds mRNA upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and helps its binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. It acts as an RNA chaperone to unfold structured mRNA on the ribosome but is not essential for mRNAs with strong SDs and little 5'-UTR structure, thus it may help fine-tune which mRNAs that are translated [[cite:PUB00006376], [cite:PUB00151100]]. This protein is also able to unwind dsRNA by binding to transiently formed ssRNA regions [[cite:PUB00151101]].</p>\n\n<p>Unique among ribosomal proteins, the primary structure of bS1 contains six repeating contiguous OB-folds [[cite:PUB00006481], [cite:PUB00150654]]. There are flexible regions between the OB domains permitting free movement of the domains relative to each other.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites [[cite:PUB00007068], [cite:PUB00007069]]. About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits.</p>\n\n<p>Many ribosomal proteins, particularly those of the large subunit, are composed of a globular, surfaced-exposed domain with long finger-like projections that extend into the rRNA core to stabilise its structure. Most of the proteins interact with multiple RNA elements, often from different domains. In the large subunit, about 1/3 of the 23S rRNA nucleotides are at least in van der Waal's contact with protein, and L22 interacts with all six domains of the 23S rRNA. Proteins S4 and S7, which initiate assembly of the 16S rRNA, are located at junctions of five and four RNA helices, respectively. In this way proteins serve to organise and stabilise the rRNA tertiary structure. While the crucial activities of decoding and peptide transfer are RNA based, proteins play an active role in functions that may have evolved to streamline the process of protein synthesis. In addition to their function in the ribosome, many ribosomal proteins have some function 'outside' the ribosome [[cite:PUB00007069], [cite:PUB00007070]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002111" "Ribosomal protein S1"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00717" "30S ribosomal protein S1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein bS1", "short" "Ribosomal_bS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3846, "taxa" 15999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16952, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16662, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13048}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000110", :literature {"PUB00006376" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Danchin A."], "ISO_journal" "DNA Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/dnares/4.1.9", "medline_journal" "DNA Res", "title" "Comparison between the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis genomes suggests that a major function of polynucleotide phosphorylase is to synthesize CDP.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "9-18", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9179491}, "PUB00006481" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Subramanian AR."], "ISO_journal" "Prog.
