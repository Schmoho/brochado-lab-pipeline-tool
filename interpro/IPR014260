{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit B, one of the three subunits of the anaerobic sulphite reductase of Salmonella, and close homologues from various Clostridium species, where the three-gene neighbourhood is preserved. Two such gene clusters are found in Clostridium perfringens, but it may be that these sets of genes correspond to the distinct assimilatory and dissimilatory forms seen in Clostridium pasteurianum. Note that any one of these enzymes may have secondary substrates such as NH2OH, SeO3(2-), and SO3(2-). Heterologous expression of the anaerobic sulphite reductase of Salmonella confers on Escherichia coli the ability to produce hydrogen sulphide gas from sulphite.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR039261", "name" "Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR), nucleotide-binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02911" "anaerobic sulfite reductase subunit AsrB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphite reductase, subunit B", "short" "Sulphite_reductase_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 243, "taxa" 1371, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1341, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1341, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1106}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0624", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0624"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014260", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014260", "name" "Sulphite reductase, subunit B", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
