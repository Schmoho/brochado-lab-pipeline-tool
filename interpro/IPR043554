{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the regulatory beta subunits of the plant SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK) complex, probably a trimeric complex consisting of an alpha catalytic subunit, and a beta and a gamma non-catalytic regulatory subunits [[cite:PUB00071583]]. In Arabidopsis, there are two isoforms of the catalytic subunit (AKIN10 and AKIN11), three beta subunits (AKINbeta1, AKINbeta2, and AKINbeta3) and one gamma subunit (AKINg) [[cite:PUB00071585], [cite:PUB00071586]]. The SnRK complex in higher plants plays a role in signal transduction cascades regulating gene expression, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism [[cite:PUB00071584]]. Some known SnRK1 substrates are key metabolic enzymes such as sucrose phosphate synthase, nitrate reductase, and HMG-CoA reductase [[cite:PUB00071591]], while others are transcription factors [[cite:PUB00071592]]. Its physical interaction with nitrate reductase specifically occurs via the AKINbeta1 subunit [[cite:PUB00071585]].</p>\n\n<p>Beta subunits show conserved domains in different organisms. These domains include the Association with the SNF1 Complex (ASC) domain, which is important for interaction with the alpha and gamma subunits, and a specialised carbohydrate-binding module named the Glycogen Binding Domain (GBD). In Arabidopsis, only AKINbeta1 and AKINbeta2 exhibit both the GBD and the ASC domains [[cite:PUB00071585], [cite:PUB00071586]]. AKINbeta3 could be a plant specific subunit [[cite:PUB00071593]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46316" "SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE REGULATORY SUBUNIT BETA-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SNF1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit beta", "short" "KINB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 301, "taxa" 1317, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2434, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2434, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1509}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043554", :literature {"PUB00071593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Gissot L" "Polge C" "Bouly JP" "Lemaitre T" "Kreis M" "Thomas M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
