{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the DNA damage checkpoint protein Rad9 and its homologue in budding yeast, Ddc1. Rad9 forms a complex with Hus1 and Rad1 (called 9-1-1 complex). Ddc1 forms a similar complex with Mec1 and Rad17. Structurally, the 9-1-1 / Ddc1-Mec3-Rad17 complex is similar to the PCNA complex, which forms trimeric ring-shaped clamps. The 9-1-1 / Ddc1-Mec3-Rad17 complex plays a role in checkpoint activation that permits DNA-repair pathways to prevent cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage and replication stress [[cite:PUB00060228], [cite:PUB00062256]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In humans, 9-1-1 binds to TopBP1 and activates the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint pathway [[cite:PUB00062277]].

It also shows 3'-5' exonuclease activity [[cite:PUB00062279]].
