{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are bacterial phosphatidylcholine-hydrolysing, phospholipase C enzymes, with the characteristic domain architecture found in the hemolytyic (PlcH) and nonhemolytic (PlcN) secreted enzymes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [[cite:PUB00070794]]. PlcH hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to diacylglycerol and phosphocholine, but unlike PlcN can also hydrolyse sphingomyelin to ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) and phosphocholine. These proteins possess the twin-arginine signal sequence for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane. PlcH is secreted as a heterodimer with a small chaperone, PlcR, encoded immediately downstream.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03396" "phosphocholine-specific phospholipase C"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphocholine-specific phospholipase C", "short" "PC-PLC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1140, "taxa" 4303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5115}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
