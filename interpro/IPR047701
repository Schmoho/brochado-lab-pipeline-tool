{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents AztC from Paracoccus denitrificans ([swissprot:A1B2F3]) and similar proteins from actinomycetes and alphaproteobacteria. AztC is a component of the AztABCD zinc-uptake system. Like most ABC transporter genes, AztC is encoded in an operon with the canonical ATPase (AztA) and permease (AztB) genes [[cite:PUB00106034]]. However, the azt operon is unusual in that it includes a fourth gene, AztD ([interpro:IPR047697]), a metallochaperone that transfers zinc directly to AztC through a specific, associative mechanism [[cite:PUB00105512]].</p>\n\n<p>AztC can acquire zinc either from solution or from the metallochaperone AztD. AztC is composed of two structurally related α/β domains connected by a long α-helix. The zinc-binding site is located in the cleft between domains. Crystal structures for holo- and apoAztC suggest significant structural changes accompanying zinc binding [[cite:PUB00106033]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040870" "zinc ABC transporter substrate-binding protein AztC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein AztC-like", "short" "AztC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 342, "taxa" 1309, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 992}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047701", :literature {"PUB00106034" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Meni A" "Yukl ET."], "ISO_journal" "Biomolecules", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biomolecules", "title" "Structural Features Mediating Zinc Binding and Transfer in the AztABCD Zinc Transporter System.
