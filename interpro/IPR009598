{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of a series of short proteins of around 90 residues in length which includes Apoptosis inducing factor BLCAP from human ([swissprot:O60629]), also known as BC10. BCALP acts as a tumor suppressor; it induces growth arrest at G1/S checkpoint and apoptosis via RB1-dependent and p53/TP53- and NF-kappa-B-independent mechanisms [[cite:PUB00153763], [cite:PUB00153764], [cite:PUB00153765], [cite:PUB00153766]]. It has been implicated in bladder cancer where the transcription of the gene coding for this protein is nearly completely abolished in highly invasive transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) [[cite:PUB00044678]].</p>\n\n<p>The protein is a small globular protein containing two transmembrane helices, and it is a multiply edited transcript. All the editing sites are found in either the 5'-UTR or the N-terminal section of the protein, which is predicted to be outside the membrane. The three coding edits are all non-synonymous and predicted to encode exposed residues [[cite:PUB00012807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01396" "Bladder cancer-related protein BC10"}, "panther" {"PTHR13259" "BLADDER CANCER 10 KD PROTEIN HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apoptosis inducing factor BLCAP", "short" "BCALP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1575, "taxa" 5303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2107, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2107, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1452}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009598", :literature {"PUB00012807" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Gromova I" "Gromov P" "Celis JE."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
