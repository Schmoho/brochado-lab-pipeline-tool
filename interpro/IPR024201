{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These conserved animal proteins contain one copy of the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain ([pfam:PF00149]) and possess motifs characteristic of a variety of enzymatically active phosphoesterases [[cite:PUB00014394]], including acid and alkaline phosphatases, phosphoprotein phosphatases, 5'-nucleotidase, bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (symmetrical), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, 2',3'-cylic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase, and 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase CpdA. Two human genes have been identified. One, expressed in fetal brain, was isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region associated with mental retardation component of the WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, mental retardation) syndrome. The other, expressed in adult tissues, was mapped to chromosome 22 [[cite:PUB00027986]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rl5", "name" "Rat metallophosphodiesterase MPPED2 H67R Mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF035808" "Predicted phosphoesterase, brain protein 239 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Calcineurin-like phosphoesterase", "short" "Calcineurin-like_Pesterase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 760, "taxa" 3004, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1720, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1704, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1193}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024201", :literature {"PUB00014394" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Klabunde T" "Strater N" "Frohlich R" "Witzel H" "Krebs B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
