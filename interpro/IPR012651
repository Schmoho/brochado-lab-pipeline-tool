{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family have been assigned as thiamine transporters by a phylogenomic analysis of families of genes regulated by the THI element, a broadly conserved RNA secondary structure element through which thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) levels can regulate transcription of many genes related to thiamine transport, salvage, and de novo biosynthesis. Species with this protein always lack the ThiBPQ ABC transporter. In some species (e.g. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pyogenes), YuaJ is the only THI-regulated gene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thiamine transporter YuaJ, also known as ThiT, is a member of the energy coupling factor (ECF) transporters, a new class of transport proteins that shares some resemblance with ABC transporters [[cite:PUB00055602], [cite:PUB00055603]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4mes", "name" "Crystal structure of ThiT complexed with LMG116"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09515" "Thiamine transporter protein (Thia_YuaJ)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02357" "energy-coupled thiamine transporter ThiT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiamine transporter ThiT", "short" "Thia_Transptr_ThiT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 1057, "taxa" 3980, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4406, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4388, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3202}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1094", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1094"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012651", :literature {"PUB00055602" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Erkens GB" "Slotboom DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi100154r", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Biochemical characterization of ThiT from Lactococcus lactis: a thiamin transporter with picomolar substrate binding affinity.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "3203-12", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20218726}, "PUB00055603" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Eitinger T" "Rodionov DA" "Grote M" "Schneider E."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
