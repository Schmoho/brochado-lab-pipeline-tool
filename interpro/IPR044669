{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of voltage-dependent anion channels from bacteria and eukaryotes, formerly known as UPF0187, including Voltage-dependent anion channel-forming protein YneE from E.coli and Voltage-dependent chloride channel 1/2 from Arabidopsis, which are related to the Bestrophin family. In bacteria, these anion transporters are poorly characterised. VCCN1/2 are chloride channels critical for proton motive force (PMF) partitioning across the thylakoid membrane by anion influx into the lumen during illumination, thus being required for photoprotection under fluctuating light conditions [[cite:PUB00096750], [cite:PUB00096749]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33281" "UPF0187 PROTEIN YNEE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Voltage-dependent anion channel-forming protein YneE/VCCN1/2-like", "short" "YneE/VCCN1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3084, "taxa" 12314, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18862, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18862, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13693}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044669", :literature {"PUB00096750" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Duan Z" "Kong F" "Zhang L" "Li W" "Zhang J" "Peng L."], "ISO_journal" "J Integr Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Integr Plant Biol", "title" "A bestrophin-like protein modulates the proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "848-858", "volume" "58", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26947269}, "PUB00096749" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Herdean A" "Teardo E" "Nilsson AK" "Pfeil BE" "Johansson ON" "Unnep R" "Nagy G" "Zsiros O" "Dana S" "Solymosi K" "Garab G" "Szabo I" "Spetea C" "Lundin B."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "A voltage-dependent chloride channel fine-tunes photosynthesis in plants.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "11654", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27216227}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021134", "name" "Bestrophin-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000615", "name" "Bestrophin", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044669", "name" "Voltage-dependent anion channel-forming protein YneE/VCCN1/2-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR024701", "name" "Voltage-dependent chloride channel 1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
