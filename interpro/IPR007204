{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arp2/3 binds to pre-existing actin filaments and nucleates new daughter filaments, and thus becomes incorporated into the dynamic actin network at the leading edge of motile cells and other actin-based protrusive structures [[cite:PUB00035127]]. The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility [[cite:PUB00008558]]. In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA. It promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) [[cite:PUB00101759]]. In order to nucleate filaments, Arp2/3 must bind to a member of the N-WASp/SCAR family protein [[cite:PUB00020552]]. Arp2 and Arp3 are thought to be brought together after activation, forming an actin-like nucleus for actin monomers to bind and create a new actin filament. In the absence of an activating protein, Arp2/3 shows very little nucleation activity. Recent research has focused on the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Arp2 and Arp3 [[cite:PUB00035128]], and crystal structures of the Arp2/3 complex have been solved [[cite:PUB00022758]].</p>\n\n<p>The human complex consists of Arp2/3 complex composed of ARP2, ARP3, ARPC1B/p41-ARC, ARPC2/p34-ARC, ARPC3/p21-ARC, ARPC4/p20-ARC and ARPC5/p16-ARC.
