{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of bacterial proteins that include the lipid A deacylase LpxR from Salmonella typhimurium. LpxR is an outer membrane protein that catalyses the removal of the the 3'-acyloxyacyl moiety from lipid A. It requires Ca2+  for its activity. This enzyme folds into a 12-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with the N- and C- terminal ends pointing towards the periplasm and three extracellular loops consisting of α-helical regions at the opposite side of the β-barrel [[cite:PUB00051973]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3fid", "name" "LpxR from Salmonella typhimurium"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037107", "name" "Putative outer membrane protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09982" "Outer membrane protein LpxR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid A deacylase LpxR", "short" "LpxR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 1130, "taxa" 5040, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5358, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5353, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4183}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018707", :literature {"PUB00051973" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Rutten L" "Mannie JP" "Stead CM" "Raetz CR" "Reynolds CM" "Bonvin AM" "Tommassen JP" "Egmond MR" "Trent MS" "Gros P."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
