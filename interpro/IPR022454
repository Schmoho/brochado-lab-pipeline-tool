{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins found in coenzyme F420 biosynthesizing species of the Actinobacterial, Chloroflexi and Archaeal lineages. The few organisms having genes within this family and lacking F420 biosynthesis may either have an undiscovered F420 transporter, or may represent F420-to-FMN revertants. This family includes a Chloroflexus Aurantiacus protein whose crystal structure has been determined. This has been annotated as a putative hydrolase, but there is currently no supporting evidence for this. There is no cofactor present in the structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03883" "uncharacterized protein, coenzyme F420 biosynthesis associated"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03883, F420 biosynthesis associated", "short" "CHP03883_F420-assoc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1571, "taxa" 4727, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4858, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3764}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0002", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0002"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022454", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018766", "name" "Zinicin-like metallopeptidase type 2", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR022454", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03883, F420 biosynthesis associated", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
