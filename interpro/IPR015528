Production of the cytokine plays an important role in the generation of cell-mediated immunity against many infectious pathogens [[cite:PUB00043736]]. The interluekin-12 beta chain also associates with interleukin-23 alpha to form interleukin-23 [[cite:PUB00013064]], a proinflammatory cytokine that is overexpressed in and around tumour tissues, where it induces local inflammation and promotes tumour development [[cite:PUB00043737]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5mj3", "name" "INTERLEUKIN-23 COMPLEX WITH AN ANTAGONISTIC ALPHABODY, CRYSTAL FORM 1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038007" "Interleukin-12, beta subunit"}, "prints" {"PR01928" "Interleukin-12 beta subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-12 beta", "short" "IL-12_beta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 609, "taxa" 2097, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1878, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1228, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 864}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015528", :literature {"PUB00043736" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5428", "authors" ["Brightbill HD" "Libraty DH" "Krutzik SR" "Yang RB" "Belisle JT" "Bleharski JR" "Maitland M" "Norgard MV" "Plevy SE" "Smale ST" "Brennan PJ" "Bloom BR" "Godowski PJ" "Modlin RL."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5428.732", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Host defense mechanisms triggered by microbial lipoproteins through toll-like receptors.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "732-6", "volume" "285", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10426995}, "PUB00013064" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Oppmann B" "Lesley R" "Blom B" "Timans JC" "Xu Y" "Hunte B" "Vega F" "Yu N" "Wang J" "Singh K" "Zonin F" "Vaisberg E" "Churakova T" "Liu M" "Gorman D" "Wagner J" "Zurawski S" "Liu Y" "Abrams JS" "Moore KW" "Rennick D" "de Waal-Malefyt R" "Hannum C" "Bazan JF" "Kastelein RA."], "ISO_journal" "Immunity", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1074-7613(00)00070-4", "medline_journal" "Immunity", "title" "Novel p19 protein engages IL-12p40 to form a cytokine, IL-23, with biological activities similar as well as distinct from IL-12.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "715-25", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11114383}, "PUB00043737" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Shime H" "Yabu M" "Akazawa T" "Kodama K" "Matsumoto M" "Seya T" "Inoue N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
