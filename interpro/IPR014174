{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this entry are designated type I-MYXAN CRISPR-associated protein Cas6/Cmx6 and resemble the Cas6 proteins described by [interpro:IPR010156] in having a C-terminal motif GXGXXXXXGXG, where the single X of each GXG is hydrophobic and the spacer XXXXX has at least one Lys or Arg. Examples are found in cas gene operons of CRISPR regions in Anabaena variabilis (strain ATCC 29413/PCC 7937), Leptospira interrogans, Gemmata obscuriglobus UQM 2246, and twice in Myxococcus xanthus (strain DK 1622).
