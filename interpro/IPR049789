{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family belong to the broader VOC (Vicinal Oxygen Chelate) domain family ([interpro:IPR037523]), which includes glyoxalase I, fosfomycin resistance proteins FosA and FosB, and dioxygenases such as 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. Members of this specific family include none of those, but instead include CadI from Mycobacterium tuberculosis ([swissprot:P9WIR5]) and YqcK from Bacillus subtilis ([swissprot:P45945]). They have an invariant CC sequence motif at about position 95, and have poorly conserved C-terminal regions that frequently contain at least one addition CC motif [[cite:PUB00106385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5d4f", "name" "Crystal structure of C-As lyase with Fe(III)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041414" "ArsI/CadI family heavy metal resistance metalloenzyme"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YqcK/CadI-like", "short" "YqcK/CadI-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1181, "taxa" 4821, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4777, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4776, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3594}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049789", :literature {"PUB00106385" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hotter GS" "Wilson T" "Collins DM."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "title" "Identification of a cadmium-induced gene in Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "151-5", "volume" "200", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11425467}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049789", "name" "YqcK/CadI-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
