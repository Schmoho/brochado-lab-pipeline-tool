{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase. This protein is characterised (indirectly) in Pseudomonas sp. (strain CF600) and was inactive except when co-expressed with DmpE, 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase, a homologous protein from the same operon [[cite:PUB00042979]]. Both of these enzymes are active in the degradation of catechol, a common intermediate in the degradation of aromatic compounds such as benzoate, toluene, phenol, dimethylphenol (dmp), salicylate, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This enzyme folds into unusual fold, the core of which contains 3 layers of β-sheet structure and looks like β-barrel and β-sandwich fused together with features brought from both [[cite:PUB00150964]]. The 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylases are structurally similar to fumarylacetoacetate hydrolases (FAH) and to members of FAH superfamily of enzymes [[cite:PUB00150965]]. The latter are known to catalyse a remarkable variety of reactions and are essential in metabolic pathways that degrade aromatic compounds in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5d2k", "name" "4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida G7 - complexed with magnesium and 2-oxoadipate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036663", "name" "Fumarylacetoacetase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03218" "2-oxo-3-hexenedioate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase", "short" "4-oxalocrotonate_decarboxylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 173, "taxa" 963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 826, "sets" 0, "proteins" 826, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 697}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0708", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0708"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
