{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from Cystovirus, including Major inner capsid protein P1, which forms the inner T=1 shell of Bacteriophage phi-6, a dodecahedral polymerase complex (PC) that contains the three viral dsRNA segments. The protein folds into a flattened trapezoid shape with a mostly α-helical fold. It was initially though to adopt a funnel-shaped pentameric assembly, but later research has shown dimers of different P1 chains are also present in the virus capsid [[cite:PUB00152050], [cite:PUB00152051], [cite:PUB00152052]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20837" "Major inner capsid protein P1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major inner capsid protein P1", "short" "P1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 81, "sets" 0, "proteins" 80, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048856", :literature {"PUB00152050" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Nemecek D" "Boura E" "Wu W" "Cheng N" "Plevka P" "Qiao J" "Mindich L" "Heymann JB" "Hurley JH" "Steven AC."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2013.06.007", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Subunit folds and maturation pathway of a dsRNA virus capsid.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1374-83", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23891288}, "PUB00152051" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["El Omari K" "Sutton G" "Ravantti JJ" "Zhang H" "Walter TS" "Grimes JM" "Bamford DH" "Stuart DI" "Mancini EJ."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2013.06.017", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Plate tectonics of virus shell assembly and reorganization in phage φ8, a distant relative of mammalian reoviruses.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1384-95", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23891291}, "PUB00152052" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sun Z" "El Omari K" "Sun X" "Ilca SL" "Kotecha A" "Stuart DI" "Poranen MM" "Huiskonen JT."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14814", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Double-stranded RNA virus outer shell assembly by bona fide domain-swapping.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "14814", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28287099}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048856", "name" "Major inner capsid protein P1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 5}}}
