{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rab4 is a member of the large Rab GTPase family. It has been implicated in numerous functions within the cell. It helps regulate endocytosis through the sorting, recycling, and degradation of early endosomes. Mammalian Rab4 is involved in the regulation of many surface proteins including G-protein-coupled receptors, transferrin receptor, integrins, and surfactant protein A. Experimental data implicate Rab4 in regulation of the recycling of internalized receptors back to the plasma membrane. It is also believed to influence receptor-mediated antigen processing in B-lymphocytes, in calcium-dependent exocytosis in platelets, in alpha-amylase secretion in pancreatic cells, and in insulin-induced translocation of Glut4 from internal vesicles to the cell surface [[cite:PUB00039681], [cite:PUB00091889]]. Rab4 is known to share effector proteins with Rab5 and Rab11 [[cite:PUB00092533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1z0k", "name" "Structure of GTP-Bound Rab4Q67L GTPase in complex with the central Rab binding domain of Rabenosyn-5"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04113" "Rab GTPase family 4 (Rab4)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab4", "short" "Rab4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 745, "taxa" 3083, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1736, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1736, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1155}, "pathways" 29}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
