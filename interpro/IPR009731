{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from tailed bacteriophages and proteobacterial prophages, including Bacteriophage lambda replication protein P, also known as Helicase loader. This protein promotes replication of the phage chromosome by recruiting a key component of the cellular replication machinery to the viral origin. Specifically, it delivers one or more molecules of Escherichia coli DnaB helicase to a nucleoprotein structure formed by the lambda O initiator at the lambda replication origin [[cite:PUB00012966], [cite:PUB00154482]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06992" "Replication protein P"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Replication P-like", "short" "P-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 296, "taxa" 1979, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2524, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2523, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1713}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009731", :literature {"PUB00012966" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Mallory JB" "Alfano C" "McMacken R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
