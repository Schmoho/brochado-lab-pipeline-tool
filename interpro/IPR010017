{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents tRNA U34 carboxymethyltransferase CmoB.</p>\n<p>CmoA and CmoB are important components of the cmo5U biosynthetic pathway. These enzymes are involved in the conversion of 5-hydroxyuridine (ho5U) to uridine-5-oxyacetic acid (cmo5U) at the wobble position (34) of tRNA [[cite:PUB00043575]]. Uridine-5-oxyacetic acid at tRNA position 34 is apparently necessary for the efficient decoding of G-ending Pro, Ala, and Val codons in these organisms [[cite:PUB00043576]]. cmo5U modification requires the previously unknown metabolite carboxy-S-adenosine-L-methionine (Cx-SAM), which is generated by CmoA. CmoB catalyzes carboxymethyl transfer from Cx-SAM to ho5U, converting ho5U into cmo5U at the wobble position of multiple tRNAs in Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00079211]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4p7c", "name" "Crystal structure of putative methyltransferase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01590" "tRNA U34 carboxymethyltransferase [cmoB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00452" "tRNA 5-methoxyuridine(34)/uridine 5-oxyacetic acid(34) synthase CmoB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA U34 carboxymethyltransferase", "short" "CmoB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 941, "taxa" 5419, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6045, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6045, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4679}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1340", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1340"} {"accession" "GenProp1077", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1077"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
