{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the stage V sporulation (SpoV) proteins of Bacillus subtilis which includes SpoVM. SpoVM is an small, 26 residue-long protein that is produced in the mother cell chamber of the sporangium during the process of sporulation in B. subtilis. SpoVM forms an amphipathic Î±-helix and is recruited to the polar septum shortly after the sporangium undergoes asymmetric division. The function of SpoVM depends on proper subcellular localisation [[cite:PUB00016502]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08183" "Stage V sporulation protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation stage V, protein M", "short" "Spore_V_M"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 334, "taxa" 1056, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 831, "sets" 0, "proteins" 831, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 630}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012609", :literature {"PUB00016502" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["van Ooij C" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
