{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>FLC EXPRESSOR (FLX) is a specific component of the FRI complex (FRI-C). Several FLX-like proteins exist in Arabidopsis. FLX-like 4 (FLX4) is known to be also a component of FRI-C and, like FLX, is required for the activation of FLC by FRI. FLC and FRI are determinants of the vernalization-requiring, winter-annual habit, blocking flowering prior to winter [[cite:PUB00090843], [cite:PUB00090844]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33405" "PROTEIN FLX-LIKE 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FLC EXPRESSOR/FLX-like", "short" "FLX/FLX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 257, "taxa" 1072, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3211, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3211, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1879}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040353", :literature {"PUB00090843" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ding L" "Kim SY" "Michaels SD."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.113.223958", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "FLOWERING LOCUS C EXPRESSOR family proteins regulate FLOWERING LOCUS C expression in both winter-annual and rapid-cycling Arabidopsis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "243-52", "volume" "163", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23899645}, "PUB00090844" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lee J" "Amasino RM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3186", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Two FLX family members are non-redundantly required to establish the vernalization requirement in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "2186", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23864009}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040353", "name" "FLC EXPRESSOR/FLX-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
