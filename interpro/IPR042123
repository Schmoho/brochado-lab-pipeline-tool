{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents budding yeast Zip3 (also known as Cst9)  and its homologues including Vilya/Nenya/narya from Drosophila melanogaster, RNF212/RNF212B from animals and Zip homologous proteins 1, 2, 3 and 4 from Caenorhabditis elegans. In budding yeasts, Zip3 is a SUMO E3 ligase and a component of the synapsis initiation complex (SIC) required for synaptonemal complex formation. Zip3 possesses a C3H2C3 RING finger motif, which is required for its E3 SUMO ligase activity in vitro [[cite:PUB00092603]].</p>\n\n<p>The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous complex that apparently mediates synapsis between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase [[cite:PUB00045179]]. A number of chromosomal crossover factors and DNA damage repair components have been found to associate with both synaptonemal complexes and multiple synaptonemal complexes (polycomplexes). These include Zip3 (Cst9) from budding yeast, which localizes throughout the body of polycomplexes [[cite:PUB00045179]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22663" "RING FINGER PROTEIN NARYA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zip3/RNF212-like", "short" "Zip3/RNF212-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 853, "taxa" 3594, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2062, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2062, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1320}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
