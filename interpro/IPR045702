{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). This BGC (BGC0001035) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic classes, NRP (non-ribosomal peptide), polyketide and other (Aminocoumarin). This family includes a protein from the pneumocandin B0 biosynthetic gene cluster from Glarea lozoyensis ATCC 20868 and appear to be predominantly found in fungi [[cite:PUB00098936], [cite:PUB00098937]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19535" "Family of unknown function (DUF6060)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6060", "short" "DUF6060"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 213, "taxa" 712, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 669, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 436}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045702", :literature {"PUB00098936" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Chen L" "Yue Q" "Zhang X" "Xiang M" "Wang C" "Li S" "Che Y" "Ortiz-Lopez FJ" "Bills GF" "Liu X" "An Z."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Genomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Genomics", "title" "Genomics-driven discovery of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster in the fungus Glarea lozoyensis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "339", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23688303}, "PUB00098937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Li Y" "Chen L" "Yue Q" "Liu X" "An Z" "Bills GF."], "ISO_journal" "ACS Chem Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "ACS Chem Biol", "title" "Genetic Manipulation of the Pneumocandin Biosynthetic Pathway for Generation of Analogues and Evaluation of Their Antifungal Activity.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1702-10", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25879325}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045702", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6060", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 25, "alignment:full" 234}}}
