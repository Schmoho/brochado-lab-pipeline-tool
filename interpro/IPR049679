{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Ion-translocating oxidoreductase complex subunit B (RnfB, [swissprot:Q8TSX9]) from Methanosarcina acetivorans  and related proteins found in Methanosarcinaceae species. RnfB is part of a membrane-bound complex that couples electron transfer with translocation of ions across the membrane. RnfB catalyses sodium transport, most probably coupled to electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to methanophenazine and heterodisulfide reductase. It is involved in heterodisulfide reduction during methanogenesis from acetate [[cite:PUB00152961]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041836" "Rnf electron transport complex subunit RnfB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ion-translocating oxidoreductase complex subunit RnfB, Methanosarcinaceae", "short" "Ion_transpt_RnfB_Methano"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 86, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 55, "sets" 0, "proteins" 55, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 50}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
