{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>There are two major pathways for regulating cellular redox homeostasis, antioxidant defense and to provide reducing equivalents for a variety of chemical transformations in most organisms, which involve glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) and the thioredoxin (Trx) dependent systems. They include GSSG reductase (GR) for recycling oxidized glutathione using NADPH , while Trx system includes a NADPH dependent reductase Trx reductase (TrxR). GR and TrxR are closely related oxidoreductases with highly similar structure and reaction mechanism, belonging to the GR superfamily of dimeric flavoenzymes [[cite:PUB00101438]].
