{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This domain has been identified as a member of the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily through transitive meta profile searches [[cite:PUB00044133]].  The domain has two additional β-strands inserted to the core fold after the first core α-helix.  It has been speculated that it could function as s methylation-dependent restriction [[cite:PUB00044133]]. The domain has two additional β-strands inserted into the core fold after the first core α-helix. The PD-(D/E)XK signature is clearly conserved corresponding to an invariant PD (motif II) and DAK (motif III) motifs. There is also a conserved glutamic acid in motif I that is most likely to be involved in metal ion binding. The second core α-helix contains an invariant MHXYRD motif. It has been speculated that it could function as s methylation-dependent restriction enzyme [[cite:PUB00044133]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04411" "PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily 7", "short" "PDDEXK_7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 439, "taxa" 2690, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1762, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1762, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1354}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
