{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Triglyceride lipases ([ec:3.1.1.3]) are lipolytic enzymes that hydrolyse ester linkages of triglycerides [[cite:PUB00000684]]. Lipases are widely distributed in animals, plants and prokaryotes. At least three tissue-specific isozymes exist in higher vertebrates: pancreatic, hepatic and gastric/lingual. These lipases are closely related to each other and to lipoprotein lipase ([ec:3.1.1.34]), which hydrolyses triglycerides of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) [[cite:PUB00001369]]. Familial human hepatic lipase deficiency is a rare recessive disorder that results from mutation in position 405 of the mature protein. The disease is characterised by premature atherosclerosis and abnormal circulating lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00002005]]. The structure of the human hepatic triglyceride lipase gene has been determined [[cite:PUB00000314]]. The hepatic lipase gene spans ~60 kb, and contains 8 introns and 9 exons: exon 1 encodes the signal peptide; exon 4, a region that binds to the lipoprotein substrate; exon 5, an evolutionarily highly-conserved region of potential catalytic function; and exons 6 and 9 encode sequences rich in basic amino acids, thought to be important in anchoring the enzyme to the endothelial surface by interacting with acidic domains of surface glycosaminoglycans [[cite:PUB00000314]]. The human lipoprotein lipase gene has an identical exon-intron organisation, with analogous structural domains, supporting the common evolutionary origin of these two lipolytic enzymes [[cite:PUB00005099]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036392", "name" "PLAT/LH2 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00824" "HEPLIPASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hepatic lipase", "short" "Lipase_hep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 621, "taxa" 2124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6263, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1094, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 732}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
