{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The spliceosome, an assembly of snRNAs (U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5) and proteins, catalyses the excision of introns from pre-mRNAs in two successive trans-esterification reactions [[cite:PUB00090374]]. Step 2 depends upon integral spliceosome constituents such as U5 snRNA and Prp8 and non-spliceosomal proteins Prp16, Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22. ATP hydrolysis by the DEAH-box enzyme Prp16 promotes a conformational change in the spliceosome that leads to protection of the 3' splice site from targeted RNase H cleavage. This change, which probably reflects binding of the 3' splice site PyAG in the catalytic centre of the spliceosome, requires the ordered recruitment of Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 to the spliceosome. There is a close functional relationship between Prp8, Prp18, and Slu7, and Prp18 interacts with Slu7, so that together they recruit Prp22 to the spliceosome. Most members of the family carry a zinc-finger of the CCHC-type; this retains the protein within the nucleus [[cite:PUB00090375]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12942" "STEP II SPLICING FACTOR SLU7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SLU7", "short" "Splicing_factor_SLU7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2570, "taxa" 8796, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5149, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3356}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039974", :literature {"PUB00090374" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Chua K" "Reed R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.13.7.841", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Human step II splicing factor hSlu7 functions in restructuring the spliceosome between the catalytic steps of splicing.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "841-50", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10197984}, "PUB00090375" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Shomron N" "Reznik M" "Ast G."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
