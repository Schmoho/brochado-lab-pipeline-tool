{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of plant proteins, such as the PWWP domain containing protein PWWP2 (At1g51745, also known SL1) from Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00096781], [cite:PUB00096780]]. Its exact function is not known. It is part of PEAT complexes (for PWWPs-EPCRs-ARIDs-TRBs) which mediate histone deacetylation and heterochromatin condensation to facilitate heterochromatin silencing. These complexes repress the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and DNA methylation [[cite:PUB00096780]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33697" "T17B22.17 PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PWWP domain containing protein PWWP2-like", "short" "PWWP2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 237, "taxa" 887, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1700, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1700, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 998}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044679", :literature {"PUB00096780" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Tan LM" "Zhang CJ" "Hou XM" "Shao CR" "Lu YJ" "Zhou JX" "Li YQ" "Li L" "Chen S" "He XJ."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The PEAT protein complexes are required for histone deacetylation and heterochromatin silencing.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30104406}, "PUB00096781" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sadiq I" "Keren I" "Citovsky V."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "Plant homologs of mammalian MBT-domain protein-regulated KDM1 histone lysine demethylases do not interact with plant Tudor/PWWP/MBT-domain proteins.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "913-6", "volume" "470", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26826387}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044679", "name" "PWWP domain containing protein PWWP2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
