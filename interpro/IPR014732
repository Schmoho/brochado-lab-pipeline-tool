{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (OMPdecase) ([ec:4.1.1.23]) [[cite:PUB00003724], [cite:PUB00002768]] catalyses the last step in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidines, the decarboxylation of OMP into UMP. In higher eukaryotes OMPdecase is part, with orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, of a bifunctional enzyme, while the prokaryotic and fungal OMPdecases are monofunctional proteins.</p>\n\n<p>Some parts of the sequence of OMPdecase are well conserved across species. The best conserved region is located in the N-terminal half of OMPdecases and is centred around a lysine residue which is essential for the catalytic function of the enzyme.</p>\n\n<p>OMPdecases adopt classical TIM-barrel fold with an active site located at one side of the barrel [[cite:PUB00024159], [cite:PUB00024322]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3gdt", "name" "Crystal structure of the D91N mutant of the orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae complexed with 6-azauridine 5'-monophosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32119" "OROTIDINE 5'-PHOSPHATE DECARBOXYLASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01740" "orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase", "short" "OMPdecase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 213, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7221, "taxa" 29847, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29308, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29274, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22115}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1418", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1418"} {"accession" "GenProp1614", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1614"} {"accession" "GenProp1318", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1318"} {"accession" "GenProp1427", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1427"} {"accession" "GenProp1635", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1635"} {"accession" "GenProp0187", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0187"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
