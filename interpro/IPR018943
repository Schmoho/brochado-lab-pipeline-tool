{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ost4 is a very short, approximately 30 residues, enzyme found from fungi to vertebrates. It is a member of the ER oligosaccaryltansferase complex, [ec:2.4.1.119], that catalyses the asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins. It appears to be an integral membrane protein that mediates the en bloc transfer of a pre-assembled high-mannose oligosaccharide onto asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as they enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036330", "name" "Oligosaccharyltransferase subunit ost4p superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10215" "Oligosaccaryltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oligosaccaryltransferase", "short" "Oligosaccaryltransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 36, "proteomes" 1030, "taxa" 4069, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1767, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1763, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1199}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018943", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018943", "name" "Oligosaccaryltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044165", "name" "Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit 4, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 47, "alignment:full" 1044}}}
