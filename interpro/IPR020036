{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of N-acetyltransferases that are proposed to perform an N-acetylation step in the process of pseudaminic acid biosynthesis in Campylobacter species [[cite:PUB00045365]]. They are commonly encoded in apparent operons with other genes involved in the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid, and are components of flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis loci. Significantly, many genomes containing other components of this pathway lack this gene, indicating that some other N-acetyl transferases may be involved and/or the step is optional, resulting in a non-acetylated pseudaminic acid variant sugar.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xpl", "name" "The crystal structure of Campylobacter jejuni N-acetyltransferase PseH in complex with acetyl coenzyme A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03585" "UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-N-acetyl-beta-L-altrosamine N-acetyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-N-acetyl-beta-L-altrosamine N-acetyltransferase", "short" "PseH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 301, "taxa" 2045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1451, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1172}, "pathways" 219}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0796", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0796"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
