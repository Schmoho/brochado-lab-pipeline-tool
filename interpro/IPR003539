{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a secreted protein toxin produced by a number of Gram-negative disease-causing bacteria. CDT causes cell cycle arrest and eventual cell death in eukaryotic cells, as a result of chromosomal DNA damage caused by the catalytic, DNase I-like, CdtB subunit. Bacterial CDTs are generally comprised of three subunits, CdtA, -B and -C [[cite:PUB00080560]]. CdtB is translocated into the host cell, where it acts as a genotoxin [[cite:PUB00037634], [cite:PUB00080562]]. CdtA and CdtC are needed for cell surface binding and cellular entry, and it is likely that they remain associated with the membrane, when CdtB is internalized. CdtB enters the target nucleus via nuclear translocation signal domain(s) [[cite:PUB00080561]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sr4", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal distending toxin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036691", "name" "Endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09081" "CdtB, the catalytic DNase I-like subunit of cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018539" "Cytolethal distending toxin, subunit B"}, "prints" {"PR01388" "CDTOXINB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytolethal distending toxin B", "short" "CD_toxinB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 85, "taxa" 647, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1399, "sets" 0, "proteins" 797, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 690}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003539", :literature {"PUB00080561" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["Nishikubo S" "Ohara M" "Ueno Y" "Ikura M" "Kurihara H" "Komatsuzawa H" "Oswald E" "Sugai M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
