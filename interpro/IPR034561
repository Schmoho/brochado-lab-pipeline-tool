{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SNI1 was isolated in a screen for negative regulators of NPR1, a transcriptional coactivator of plant pathogen defence gene PR1  [[cite:PUB00083718]].  SNl1 has been shown to cooperate with the transcription repressor CBNAC, which binds to cis-elements on the PR1 promoter, to suppress PR1 expression [[cite:PUB00083719]]. SNI1 also regulates DNA damage sensor proteins RAD17 and ATR, suggesting that DNA damage responses is an intrinsic component of the plant immune responses. SNI1 is a subunit of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) 5/6 complex involved in DNA damage responses   [[cite:PUB00083720]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37243" "NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE SNI1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Negative regulator of systemic acquired resistance SNI1", "short" "SNI1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 228, "taxa" 891, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 617, "sets" 0, "proteins" 617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 378}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034561", :literature {"PUB00083718" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Li X" "Zhang Y" "Clarke JD" "Li Y" "Dong X."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81962-5", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Identification and cloning of a negative regulator of systemic acquired resistance, SNI1, through a screen for suppressors of npr1-1.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "329-39", "volume" "98", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10458608}, "PUB00083719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Kim HS" "Park HC" "Kim KE" "Jung MS" "Han HJ" "Kim SH" "Kwon YS" "Bahk S" "An J" "Bae DW" "Yun DJ" "Kwak SS" "Chung WS."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks683", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "A NAC transcription factor and SNI1 cooperatively suppress basal pathogen resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "9182-92", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22826500}, "PUB00083720" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Yan S" "Wang W" "Marques J" "Mohan R" "Saleh A" "Durrant WE" "Song J" "Dong X."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
