{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of IGFBP (insulin-like growth fac- tor (IGF) binding proteins)-related proteins, which have been annotated as the CNN family [[cite:PUB00014624], [cite:PUB00091693]]. Members of the CCN family are composed of an N-terminal secretory signal peptide followed by four conserved domains with homology to insulin-like growth factor binding protein, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a C-terminal domain (CT) with heparin-binding motifs and sequence similarity to the C termini of von Willebrand factor and mucin. The CCN family includes CCN1 (CYR61) [[cite:PUB00091690]], CCN2 (CTGF), CCN3 [[cite:PUB00091693]], CCN4 (WISP-1) [[cite:PUB00091692]], CCN5 (WISP-2), and CCN6 (WISP-3).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036495" "IGFBP-related protein, CNN type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IGFBP-related, CNN", "short" "IGFBP_CNN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 645, "taxa" 2208, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4524, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4399, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3041}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012395", :literature {"PUB00091693" {"URL" nil, "issue" "26", "authors" ["Lin CG" "Leu SJ" "Chen N" "Tebeau CM" "Lin SX" "Yeung CY" "Lau LF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
