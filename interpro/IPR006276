{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methionine synthases catalyse the the final step of methionine biosynthesis. Two apparently unrelated families of proteins catalyse this step: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase, which catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate to L-homocysteine and requires cobalamin as a cofactor (MetH; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:L-homocysteine S-methyltransferase; [ec:2.1.1.13]) and cobalamin-independent methionine synthase, which catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to L-homocysteine without using an intermediate methyl carrier (MetE; 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltri-L-glutamate:L-homocysteine S-methyltransferase; [ec:2.1.1.14]). These enzymes display no detectable sequence homology between them, but both require zinc for activation and binding to L-homocysteine. Organisms that cannot obtain cobalamin (vitamin B12) encode only the cobalamin-independent enzyme. Escherichia coli and many other bacteria express both enzymes [[cite:PUB00070291]].
