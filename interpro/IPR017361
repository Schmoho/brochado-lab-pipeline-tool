{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the magnesium-dependent bifunctional phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase/dual-specificity protein phosphatase PTEN ([ec:3.1.3.67]; [ec:3.1.3.16]; [ec:3.1.3.48]), which possesses the following catalytic activities:</p>\r\n\n<ul><li>Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate + H(2)O = phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate + phosphate.</li>\r\n<li>A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein + phosphate.</li>\r\n<li>Protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein tyrosine + phosphate.</li></ul>\r\n<p>This protein acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine-and threonine-phosphorylated proteins [[cite:PUB00044639]]. It also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumour suppressor function [[cite:PUB00044640]]. PTEN antagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signalling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form of PTEN cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. PTEN dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion form [[cite:PUB00044641]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038025" "Bifunctional phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase/dual-specificity protein phosphatase PTEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate phosphatase/dual specificity phosphatase PTEN", "short" "Bifunc_PIno_P3_Pase/Pase_PTEN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 578, "taxa" 2106, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1601, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1257, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 832}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
