{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the adenine-specific methyltransferase PglX, which specifically methylates the adenine in the fifth position of the 5'-TAGGAG-3' region in genomic DNA but not in phage DNA upon infection [[cite:PUB00151211], [cite:PUB00093365]]. It is associated with BREX (bacteriophage exclusion) type 1 systems [[cite:PUB00093365]], which provides immunity against bacteriophage. It allows phage adsorption but blocks phage DNA replication [[cite:PUB00097935], [cite:PUB00151267]]. The methylation on non-palindromic TAGGAG motifs in the bacterial genome guides self/non-self discrimination and is essential for the defensive function of the BREX system. Unlike restriction-modification systems, phage DNA does not appear to be cleaved or degraded by BREX.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033452" "BREX-1 system adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase PglX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase PglX", "short" "BREX_1_PglX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 516, "taxa" 3461, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2554, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1956}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
