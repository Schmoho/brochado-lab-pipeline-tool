FtsH is a 647-residue protein of 70kDa, with two putative transmembrane segments towards its N terminus which anchor the protein to the membrane, giving rise to a periplasmic domain of 70 residues and a cytoplasmic segment of 520 residues containing the ATPase and protease domains [[cite:PUB00007912]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main function of organellar AAA/FtsH proteases is selective degradation of non-assembled, incompletely assembled and/or damaged membrane-anchored proteins.
