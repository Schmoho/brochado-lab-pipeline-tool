{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amidase_YiiX is a family of permuted papain-like amidases. It has amidase specificity for the amide bond between a lipid and an amino acid (or peptide). From the structure, a tetramer, each monomer is made up of a layered α-β fold with a central, 6-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet that is protected by helices on either side. The catalytic Cys154 in [swissprot:Q74NK7], [PDBe:3kw0], is located on the N terminus of helix αF. The two additional helices located above Cys154 contribute to the formation of the active site, where the lysine ligand is bound [[cite:PUB00075488]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes poxvirus protein G6 (also known as OPG091) which has sequence similarity with a group of bacterial permuted papain-like amidases, whose gene might have been acquired from a bacterial source at the onset of poxvirus evolution [[cite:PUB00103627]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2if6", "name" "Crystal structure of metalloprotein yiiX from Escherichia coli O157:H7, DUF1105"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038765", "name" "Papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05708" "Permuted papain-like amidase enzyme, YaeF/YiiX, C92 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Permuted papain-like amidase enzyme, YaeF/YiiX, C92 family", "short" "Peptidase_C92"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 72, "proteomes" 1273, "taxa" 7669, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8773, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8771, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6406}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024453", :literature {"PUB00103627" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Senkevich TG" "Wyatt LS" "Weisberg AS" "Koonin EV" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "A conserved poxvirus NlpC/P60 superfamily protein contributes to vaccinia virus virulence in mice but not to replication in cell culture.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "506-14", "volume" "374", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18281072}, "PUB00075488" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Xu Q" "Rawlings ND" "Chiu HJ" "Jaroszewski L" "Klock HE" "Knuth MW" "Miller MD" "Elsliger MA" "Deacon AM" "Godzik A" "Lesley SA" "Wilson IA."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022013", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Structural analysis of papain-like NlpC/P60 superfamily enzymes with a circularly permuted topology reveals potential lipid binding sites.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e22013", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21799766}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024453", "name" "Permuted papain-like amidase enzyme, YaeF/YiiX, C92 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 1584}}}
