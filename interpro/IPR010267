{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Chordopoxvirus A20R proteins. The A20R protein, also known as DNA polymerase processivity factor component OPG148, plays an essential role in viral DNA replication by acting as the polymerase processivity factor together with protein OPG116 [[cite:PUB00103661]]. It serves as a bridge which links the DNA polymerase OPG071 and the uracil DNA glycosylase [[cite:PUB00103662], [cite:PUB00103663]]. A20R may contribute to the assembly or stability of the multiprotein DNA replication complex [[cite:PUB00011926]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4od8", "name" "Crystal structure of the vaccinia virus DNA polymerase holoenzyme subunit D4 in complex with the A20 N-terminus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05941" "Chordopoxvirus A20R protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chordopoxvirus A20R", "short" "Chordopox_A20R"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 192, "sets" 0, "proteins" 192, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010267", :literature {"PUB00011926" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ishii K" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.2002.1721", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Mapping interaction sites of the A20R protein component of the vaccinia virus DNA replication complex.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "232-9", "volume" "303", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12490386}, "PUB00103661" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Druck Shudofsky AM" "Silverman JE" "Chattopadhyay D" "Ricciardi RP."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Vaccinia virus D4 mutants defective in processive DNA synthesis retain binding to A20 and DNA.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "12325-35", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20861259}, "PUB00103662" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Klemperer N" "McDonald W" "Boyle K" "Unger B" "Traktman P."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "The A20R protein is a stoichiometric component of the processive form of vaccinia virus DNA polymerase.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "12298-307", "volume" "75", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11711620}, "PUB00103663" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Stanitsa ES" "Arps L" "Traktman P."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Vaccinia virus uracil DNA glycosylase interacts with the A20 protein to form a heterodimeric processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "3439-51", "volume" "281", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16326701}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010267", "name" "Chordopoxvirus A20R", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 36}}}
