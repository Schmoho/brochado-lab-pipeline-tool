{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytokinesis needs to be regulated spatially in order to ensure that it occurs between the daughter genomes. In prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli, cytokinesis is initiated by FtsZ, a tubulin-like protein that assembles into a ring structure at the cell centre called the Z ring. A fundamental problem in prokaryotic cell biology is to understand how the midcell division site is identified. Two major negative regulatory systems are known to be involved in preventing Z-ring assembly at all sites except the midcell. One of these systems, called nucleoid occlusion, blocks Z-ring assembly in the area occupied by an unsegregated nucleoid until a critical stage in chromosome replication or segregation is reached. The other system consists of three proteins, MinC, MinD and MinE, which prevent assembly of Z rings in regions of the cell not covered by the nucleoid, such as the cell poles. MinC is an inhibitor of FtsZ polymerisation, resulting in the inhibition of Z ring assembly in the cell; MinD greatly enhances the inhibitory effects of MinC in vivo; and MinE antagonizes the effects of MinC and MinD [[cite:PUB00007870]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>MinE is a small bifunctional protein.
