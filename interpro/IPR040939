{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Vps38 from budding yeasts. Vps38 is involved in endosome-to-Golgi retrograde transport as part of the VPS34 PI3-kinase complex II [[cite:PUB00091365]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) known as Vps34 regulates intracellular membrane trafficking in endocytic sorting, cytokinesis and autophagy. Vps34 forms complexes with other proteins: Vps15, Vps30 (encoded by VPS30/ATG6 in yeast, equivalent to mammalian Beclin 1, encoded by BECN1) and either Vps38 (UVRAG) or Atg14 (ATG14L). Although the N-terminal domains of Vps30, Vps38 and Atg14 differ, the overall similarity of their domain organizations suggests that these proteins may have evolved from a common ancestor [[cite:PUB00091364]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17649" "Vacuolar protein sorting 38"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar protein sorting 38", "short" "Vps38"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 180, "taxa" 826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 327, "sets" 0, "proteins" 327, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 190}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040939", :literature {"PUB00091364" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6257", "authors" ["Rostislavleva K" "Soler N" "Ohashi Y" "Zhang L" "Pardon E" "Burke JE" "Masson GR" "Johnson C" "Steyaert J" "Ktistakis NT" "Williams RL."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac7365", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structure and flexibility of the endosomal Vps34 complex reveals the basis of its function on membranes.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "aac7365", "volume" "350", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26450213}, "PUB00091365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 20", "authors" ["Burda P" "Padilla SM" "Sarkar S" "Emr SD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
