{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) leader peptides. AdoMetDC is a key regulatory enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines. All expressed plant AdoMetDC mRNA 5, leader sequences contain a highly conserved pair of overlapping upstream ORFs (uORFs) that overlap by one base. Sequences of the small uORFs are highly conserved between monocot, dicot and gymnosperm AdoMetDC mRNA species, suggesting a translational regulatory mechanism [[cite:PUB00016511]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08132" "S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase leader peptide", "short" "AdoMetDC_leader"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 189, "taxa" 798, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 811, "sets" 0, "proteins" 810, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 468}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012511", :literature {"PUB00016511" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 2", "authors" ["Franceschetti M" "Hanfrey C" "Scaramagli S" "Torrigiani P" "Bagni N" "Burtin D" "Michael AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
