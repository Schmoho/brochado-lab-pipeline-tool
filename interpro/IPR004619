CoA is a ubiquitous and essential cofactor in all living organsims. Pantothenate kinase catalyses the first and rate limiting step in the CoA biosynthetic pathway, which involves transferring a phosphoryl group from ATP to pantothenate, also known as vitamin B5. Three distinct types of pantothenate kinase enzymes have been identified: type I PanK enzymes are typified by the E. coli CoaA protein, type II enzymes are primarily found in eukaryotic organisms whilst type III enzymes have a wider phylogenic distribution and are not feedback inhibited by CoA [[cite:PUB00050612]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bex", "name" "Type III pantothenate kinase from Thermotoga maritima complexed with pantothenate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34265" "TYPE III PANTOTHENATE KINASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01274" "Type III pantothenate kinase [coaX]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00671" "type III pantothenate kinase"}, "pfam" {"PF03309" "Type III pantothenate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III pantothenate kinase", "short" "Type_III_PanK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 43, "proteomes" 7000, "taxa" 26310, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31980, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31971, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24203}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0171", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0171"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
