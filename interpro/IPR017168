{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the glycosidases CRH1, CRH2 and their homologues. These enzymes function as GPI-lipid anchored cell wall proteins (GPI-CWP) that are localised to sites of polarized growth, particularly chitin-rich areas [[cite:PUB00044634]]. These proteins are found at the incipient bud site, as a ring at the bud neck as the bud grows, and in the septum at the time of cytokinesis. The GPI-anchor is attached to the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and serves to target the protein to the cell surface. There, the glucosamine-inositol phospholipid moiety is cleaved of and the GPI-modified mannoprotein is covalently attached via its lipidless GPI glycan remnant to the 1,6-beta-glucan of the outer cell wall layer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037299" "Predicted glycosidase CRH1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 16, CRH1, predicted", "short" "Glyco_hydro_16_CRH1_prd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 742, "taxa" 1976, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2801, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2786, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1794}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017168", :literature {"PUB00044634" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Cabib E" "Blanco N" "Grau C" "Rodriguez-Pena JM" "Arroyo J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
