{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN) proteins, also known as LITTLE NUCLEI, are important architectural components of plant nuclei and are thought to play diverse roles in heterochromatin organization and the control of nuclear morphology [[cite:PUB00090929], [cite:PUB00090930]]. CRWN proteins regulate ABA-controlled seed germination by modulating the degradation of protein ABI5.
