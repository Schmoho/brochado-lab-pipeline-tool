Class I (see [interpro:IPR006218]) includes bacterial and yeast enzymes; class II includes higher plants and various microorganisms [[cite:PUB00006352]]. They have minimal sequence identity and different regulatory and oligomeric properties, however, they have structural similarities that indicate a common ancestry for the class I and class II DAHPSs [[cite:PUB00039551]].</p>\n\n<p>The first step in the common pathway leading to the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds is the stereospecific condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) giving rise to 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) [[cite:PUB00039551]].
