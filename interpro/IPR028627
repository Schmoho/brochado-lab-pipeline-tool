{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acylphosphatase ([ec:3.6.1.7]) is an enzyme of approximately 98 amino acid residues that specifically catalyses the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond of acylphosphates [[cite:PUB00002351]], its substrates including 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and carbamyl phosphate [[cite:PUB00003238]]. The enzyme has a mainly β-sheet structure with 2 short α-helical segments. It is distributed in a tissue-specific manner in a wide variety of species, although its physiological role is as yet unknown [[cite:PUB00003238]]: it may, however, play a part in the regulation of the glycolytic pathway and pyrimidine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00002331]]. There are two known isozymes. One seems to be specific to muscular tissues, the other, called 'organ-common type', is found in many different tissues. A number of bacterial and archebacterial hypothetical proteins are highly similar to that enzyme and that probably possess the same activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents bacteria acylphosphatase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036046", "name" "Acylphosphatase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01450" "Acylphosphatase [yccX]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acylphosphatase, bacteria", "short" "Acylphosphatase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 111, "taxa" 1142, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1192, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1192, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 895}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
