CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas modules are adaptive immune systems found in archaea and bacteria against foreign nucleic acids such as phages and plasmids via RNA-guided endonucleases. CRISPR-Cas systems are classified based on Cas protein content and arrangement in CRISPR-Cas loci into two main classes (1 and 2) and at least six types (I, II, III, IV, V, VI). Class 1 systems utilize multiple Cas proteins and CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to form an effector complex while class 2 systems employ a large, single effector with crRNA to mediate interference. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems are most widespread in nature and the Cas protein composition of the employed Cascade interference complexes differ between seven subtypes (A-F, U). Type I-F variant (I-Fv) is a subtype that rely on a minimal set of five Cas proteins and has structural differences with I-F and I-E Cascades. Double strand DNA recruitment and recognition in the type I-Fv Cascade is facilitated from the major groove side by Cas5fv instead of the large subunit Cas8 and the finger domain of Cas7fv [[cite:PUB00098766], [cite:PUB00103828], [cite:PUB00103827], [cite:PUB00103829], [cite:PUB00103831]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040577" "type I-Fv CRISPR-associated protein Cas7fv"}, "cdd" {"cd21142" "type I-F variant CRISPR-associated backbone protein Cas7 (Cas7fv)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type I-Fv CRISPR-associated protein Cas7fv-like", "short" "Cas7fv-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 24, "taxa" 268, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 124, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 99}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049889", :literature {"PUB00098766" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Pausch P" "Muller-Esparza H" "Gleditzsch D" "Altegoer F" "Randau L" "Bange G."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Structural Variation of Type I-F CRISPR RNA Guided DNA Surveillance.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "622-632.e4", "volume" "67", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28781236}, "PUB00103827" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Turkowyd B" "Muller-Esparza H" "Climenti V" "Steube N" "Endesfelder U" "Randau L."], "ISO_journal" "Methods Enzymol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Methods Enzymol", "title" "Live-cell single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy of Cascade-mediated DNA surveillance.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "133-171", "volume" "616", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30691641}, "PUB00103828" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Gleditzsch D" "Muller-Esparza H" "Pausch P" "Sharma K" "Dwarakanath S" "Urlaub H" "Bange G" "Randau L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Modulating the Cascade architecture of a minimal Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "5872-82", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27216815}, "PUB00103829" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Labbate M" "Orata FD" "Petty NK" "Jayatilleke ND" "King WL" "Kirchberger PC" "Allen C" "Mann G" "Mutreja A" "Thomson NR" "Boucher Y" "Charles IG."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "A genomic island in Vibrio cholerae with VPI-1 site-specific recombination characteristics contains CRISPR-Cas and type VI secretion modules.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "36891", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27845364}, "PUB00103831" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Koonin EV" "Makarova KS" "Zhang F."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Opin Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Opin Microbiol", "title" "Diversity, classification and evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "67-78", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28605718}, "PUB00103830" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Reeks J" "Naismith JH" "White MF."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "CRISPR interference: a structural perspective.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "155-66", "volume" "453", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23805973}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049889", "name" "Type I-Fv CRISPR-associated protein Cas7fv-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
