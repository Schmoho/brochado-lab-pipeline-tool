{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are structurally and functionally related peptide hormones that function as hormonal regulators of various digestive processes and feeding behaviours. They are known to induce gastric secretion, stimulate pancreatic secretion, increase blood circulation and water secretion in the stomach and intestine, and stimulate smooth muscle contraction. Originally found in the gut, these hormones have since been shown to be present in various parts of the nervous system. Like many other active peptides they are synthesized as larger protein precursors that are enzymatically converted to their mature forms. They are found in several molecular forms due to tissue-specific post-translational processing. The biological activity of gastrin and CCK is associated with the last five C-terminal residues. One or two positions downstream, there is a conserved sulphated tyrosine residue. The amphibian caerulein skin peptide, the cockroach leukosulphakinin I and II (LSK) peptides, Drosophila melanogaster putative CCK-homologues Drosulphakinins I and II, cionin, a chicken gastrin/cholecystokinin-like peptide and cionin, a neuropeptide from the protochordate Ciona intestinalis belong to the same family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry refers to cholecystokinin and cholecystokinin-like proteins including cholecystoxin and preprocaerulein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10786" "CHOLECYSTOKININ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cholecystokinin-like", "short" "CCK-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 611, "taxa" 2160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1166, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1166, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 839}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015499", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005184", "name" "neuropeptide hormone activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007586", "name" "digestion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015499", "name" "Cholecystokinin-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
