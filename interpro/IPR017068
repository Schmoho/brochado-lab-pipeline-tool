{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents protein disulphide-isomerase A4 (also known as endoplasmic reticulum protein 72kDa or ERp-72) ([ec:5.3.4.1]), which acts as a molecular ER chaperone. ER chaperones are critical not only for quality control of proteins processed in the ER, but also for regulation of ER signalling in response to ER stress [[cite:PUB00044648]]. ERp-72 catalyses the rearrangement of -S-S- bonds in proteins. It is part a large chaperone multiprotein complex comprising CABP1, DNAJB11, HSP90B1, HSPA5, HYOU, PDIA2, PDIA4, PPIB, SDF2L1, UGT1A1 and very small amounts of ERP29, but not, or at very low levels, CALR nor CANX.  ERp-72 may functionally associate with NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) [[cite:PUB00044649]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036862" "Protein disulphide-isomerase A4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein disulphide-isomerase A4", "short" "Protein_diS-isomerase_A4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 317, "taxa" 1312, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 519, "sets" 0, "proteins" 513, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 319}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
