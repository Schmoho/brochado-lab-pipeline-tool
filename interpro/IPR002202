{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>There are two distinct classes of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzymes: class I consists of eukaryotic and most archaeal enzymes ([ec:1.1.1.34]), while class II consists of prokaryotic enzymes ([ec:1.1.1.88]) [[cite:PUB00036052], [cite:PUB00019711]].</p>\n\n<p>Class I HMG-CoA reductases catalyse the NADP-dependent synthesis of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). In vertebrates, membrane-bound HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids. In plants, mevalonate is the precursor of all isoprenoid compounds [[cite:PUB00019711]]. The reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is regulated by feedback inhibition by sterols and non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate, including cholesterol. In archaea, HMG-CoA reductase is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the isoprenoids side chains of lipids [[cite:PUB00036053]]. Class I HMG-CoA reductases consist of an N-terminal membrane domain (lacking in archaeal enzymes), and a C-terminal catalytic region. The catalytic region can be subdivided into three domains: an N-domain (N-terminal), a large L-domain, and a small S-domain (inserted within the L-domain). The L-domain binds the substrate, while the S-domain binds NADP.</p>\n\n<p>Class II HMG-CoA reductases catalyse the reverse reaction of class I enzymes, namely the NAD-dependent synthesis of HMG-CoA from mevalonate and CoA [[cite:PUB00036054]]. Some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas mevalonii, can use mevalonate as the sole carbon source. Class II enzymes lack a membrane domain. Their catalytic region is structurally related to that of class I enzymes, but it consists of only two domains: a large L-domain and a small S-domain (inserted within the L-domain). As with class I enzymes, the L-domain binds substrate, but the S-domain binds NAD (instead of NADP in class I).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ccz", "name" "Thermodynamic and structure guided design of statin hmg-coa reductase inhibitors"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009029", "name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, class I/II, substrate-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009023", "name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, class I/II, NAD/NADP-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023282", "name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023074", "name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, class I/II, catalytic domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS50065" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductases family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF00368" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase"}, "panther" {"PTHR10572" "3-HYDROXY-3-METHYLGLUTARYL-COENZYME A REDUCTASE"}, "prints" {"PR00071" "HMGCOARDTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, class I/II", "short" "HMG_CoA_Rdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 52, "domain_architectures" 146, "proteomes" 4633, "taxa" 19370, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20699, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20528, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14638}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00064", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00064"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1432", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1432"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
