{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haems are metalloporphyrins that serve as prosthetic groups for a variety of biological processes, including respiration, gas sensing, xenobiotic detoxification, cell differentiation, circadian clock control, metabolic reprogramming and microRNA processing. Haem is usually synthesised by a multistep biosynthetic pathway. The cellular pathways and molecules that mediate intracellular haem trafficking are still largely unknown [[cite:PUB00060234]].</p>\n\n<p>Caenorhabditis elegans and related helminths are natural haem auxotrophs that acquire environmental haem for incorporation into haemoproteins. In C.elegans, it has been shown that HRG-1 proteins are essential for haem homeostasis. In worms, depletion of hrg-1, or its paralogue hrg-4, results in the disruption of organismal haem sensing, and an abnormal response to haem analogues [[cite:PUB00060234]].</p>\n\n<p>HRG-1 and HRG-4 are transmembrane (TM) proteins that reside in distinct intracellular compartments. Transient knockdown of hrg-1 in zebrafish leads to hydrocephalus, yolk tube malformations and profound defects in erythropoiesis-phenotypes that are fully rescued by worm HRG-1. Human and worm proteins have been shown to co-localise, and bind and transport haem, thus establishing an evolutionarily conserved function for HRG-1 [[cite:PUB00060234]].</p>\n\n<p>Sequence analysis of HRG-1 has identified 4 predicted TM domains, and a conserved tyrosine and acidic-di-leucine-based sorting signal in the cytoplasmic C terminus. In addition, residues that could potentially either directly bind haem (H90 in TM2) or interact with the haem side chains (FARKY) are situated in the C-terminal tail [[cite:PUB00060234]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02095" "Haem transporter HRG"}, "panther" {"PTHR31525" "HEME TRANSPORTER HRG1"}, "pfam" {"PF16954" "Haem-transporter, endosomal/lysosomal, haem-responsive gene"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heme transporter HRG", "short" "HRG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 786, "taxa" 3043, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1348, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1329, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 878}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026218", :literature {"PUB00060234" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7198", "authors" ["Rajagopal A" "Rao AU" "Amigo J" "Tian M" "Upadhyay SK" "Hall C" "Uhm S" "Mathew MK" "Fleming MD" "Paw BH" "Krause M" "Hamza I."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06934", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Haem homeostasis is regulated by the conserved and concerted functions of HRG-1 proteins.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1127-31", "volume" "453", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18418376}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015232", "name" "heme transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0015886", "name" "heme transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026218", "name" "Heme transporter HRG", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 38, "alignment:full" 1238}}}
