{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1, also known as NUR77 and HMR-type), an early response protein and orphan member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily [[cite:PUB00006275]]. It binds the NGFI-B response element (NBRE) 5'-AAAGGTCA-3' [[cite:PUB00151509]]. It is expressed in the lung, brain and superior cervical ganglia, and high levels are also seen in adrenal tissue. While members of this superfamily typically bind DNA as dimers, NGFI-B binds as a monomer. A domain separate from the NGFI-B zinc fingers (the so-called A box) has been identified and is required for recognition of two adenine-thymidine base pairs at the 5' end of the NGFI-B DNA binding element [[cite:PUB00006275]]. This receptor participates in energy homeostasis by sequestrating the kinase STK11 in the nucleus, thereby attenuating cytoplasmic AMPK activation [[cite:PUB00151508]] and it regulates the inflammatory response in macrophages by regulating metabolic adaptations during inflammation, including repressing the transcription of genes involved in the citric acid cycle (TCA). NR4A1 inhibits NF-kappa-B signaling by binding to low-affinity NF-kappa-B binding sites, such as at the IL2 promoter [[cite:PUB00151507]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands [[cite:PUB00015853]]. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner [[cite:PUB00004464], [cite:PUB00006168]]. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed 'orphan' receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035500", "name" "Nuclear hormone receptor-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01285" "HMRNUCRECPTR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1", "short" "NR4A1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 373, "taxa" 1341, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3161, "sets" 0, "proteins" 584, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 429}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003071", :literature {"PUB00006275" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5053", "authors" ["Wilson TE" "Paulsen RE" "Padgett KA" "Milbrandt J."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/256/5053/107", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Participation of non-zinc finger residues in DNA binding by two nuclear orphan receptors.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "107-10", "volume" "256", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1314418}, "PUB00015853" {"URL" nil, "issue" "217", "authors" ["Schwabe JW" "Teichmann SA."], "ISO_journal" "Sci.
