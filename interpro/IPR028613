GDPMH is a member of the Nudix family of enzymes, but unlike other Nudix enzymes GDPMH catalyses the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives by nucleophilic substitution at carbon, rather than at phosphorus. Thus, these enzymes are sugar nucleotide hydrolases rather than pyrophosphatases [[cite:PUB00055109]]. GDPMH could participate in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis by influencing the concentration of GDP-mannose or GDP-glucose in the cell and might also be involved in the biosynthesis of the slime polysaccharide colanic acid [[cite:PUB00008202]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rya", "name" "Crystal Structure of the E. coli GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase in complex with GDP and MG"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00941" "GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase [gmm]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase, Enterobacteria", "short" "GDPMH_Gmm"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 34, "taxa" 588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 986, "sets" 0, "proteins" 986, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 795}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
