{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cation channel sperm-associated targeting subunit tau (CTSRT, also known as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 chromosomal region candidate gene 11 and C2 calcium-dependent domain-containing protein 6) has been identified in mice as an auxiliary component of the CatSper complex, which is involved in sperm cell hyperactivation. Sperm cell hyperactivation is required for sperm motility, essential late in the preparation of sperm for fertilization [[cite:PUB00101082]]. This protein is key for CatSper flagellar targeting and trafficking into the quadrilinear nanodomains as it links the channel-carrying vesicles and motor proteins in elongating flagella.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21665" "CATION CHANNEL SPERM-ASSOCIATED TARGETING SUBUNIT TAU"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cation channel sperm-associated targeting subunit tau", "short" "CTSRT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 167, "taxa" 688, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 472, "sets" 0, "proteins" 472, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 185}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031462", :literature {"PUB00101082" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hwang JY" "Wang H" "Lu Y" "Ikawa M" "Chung JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "C2cd6-encoded CatSperÏ„ targets sperm calcium channel to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains in the flagellar membrane.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "110226", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34998468}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031462", "name" "Cation channel sperm-associated targeting subunit tau", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
