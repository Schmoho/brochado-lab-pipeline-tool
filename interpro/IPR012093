{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic pirins are highly conserved nuclear proteins that may function as transcriptional regulators with a role in apoptosis [[cite:PUB00057391], [cite:PUB00020125]]. Prokaryotic homologues have also been identified. Both bacterial and human pirins have been shown to possess quercetinase activity [[cite:PUB00046681]], although this is not universally true for all family members -  YhaK ([swissprot:P42624]), for example, displays no such enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00049698]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pirin is composed of two structurally similar domains arranged face to face. Although the two domains are similar, the C-terminal domain of pirin differs from the N-terminal domain as it does not contain a metal binding site and its sequence does not contain the conserved metal-coordinating residues [[cite:PUB00020127]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pirin is considered a member of the cupin superfamily on the basis of primary sequence and structural similarity. The presence of a metal binding site in the N-terminal Î²-barrel of pirin, may be significant in its interaction with Bcl-3 and nuclear factor I (NFI) and role in regulating NF-kappaB transcription factor activity [[cite:PUB00020127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tq5", "name" "Crystal Structure of YhhW from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13903" "PIRIN-RELATED", "PTHR43212" "QUERCETIN 2,3-DIOXYGENASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006232" "Pirin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pirin", "short" "Pirin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8464, "taxa" 31058, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 63702, "sets" 0, "proteins" 63135, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47608}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
