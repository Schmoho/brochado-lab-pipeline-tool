{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The protein represented by this entry, YggX, serves to protect Fe-S clusters from oxidative damage [[cite:PUB00011006]]. The effect is two-fold: proteins that rely on Fe-S clusters do not become inactivated, and the release of free iron and hydrogen peroxide--a DNA damaging agent--is prevented. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that YggX chelates free iron, and recent experiments show that YggX can indeed bind Fe(II) in vitro and in vivo [[cite:PUB00014999]]. Furthermore, YggX has a positive effect on the action of at least one Fe(II)-responsive protein. The combined actions of YggX is reminiscent of iron trafficking proteins [[cite:PUB00014997]], and YggX is therefore proposed to play a role in Fe(II) trafficking [[cite:PUB00014999]]. In Escherichia coli, YggX was shown to be under the transcriptional control of the redox-sensing SoxRS system [[cite:PUB00014998]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1t07", "name" "Crystal Structure of Conserved Protein of Unknown Function PA5148 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036766", "name" "Fe(II) trafficking protein YggX superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36965" "FE(2+)-TRAFFICKING PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "hamap" {"MF_00686" "Probable Fe(2+)-trafficking protein [yggX]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029827" "Fe(II) trafficking protein YggX"}, "pfam" {"PF04362" "Bacterial Fe(2+) trafficking"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fe(II) trafficking protein YggX", "short" "Fe_traffick_prot_YggX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 1899, "taxa" 8921, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10021, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10014, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7743}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007457", :literature {"PUB00011006" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Gralnick J" "Downs D."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
