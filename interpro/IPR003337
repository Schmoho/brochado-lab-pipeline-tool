{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trehalose-phosphatases [ec:3.1.3.12] catalyse the de-phosphorylation of trehalose-6-phosphate to trehalose and orthophosphate. Trehalose is a common disaccharide of bacteria, fungi and invertebrates that appears to play a major role in desiccation tolerance. A pathway for trehalose biosynthesis may also exist in plants [[cite:PUB00008121]]. The trehalose-phosphatase signature is found in the C terminus of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase [ec:2.4.1.15] adjacent to the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase domain (see [interpro:IPR001830]). It would appear that the two equivalent genes in the Escherichia coli otsBA operon: otsA, the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and otsB, trehalose-phosphatase (this family) have undergone gene fusion in most eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00001848]]. This entry includes sequences from plants and fly that does not possess catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00152087]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1u02", "name" "Crystal structure of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase related protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02358" "Trehalose-phosphatase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00685" "trehalose-phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trehalose-phosphatase", "short" "Trehalose_PPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 275, "proteomes" 5703, "taxa" 20989, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32908, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32541, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22614}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0265", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0265"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
