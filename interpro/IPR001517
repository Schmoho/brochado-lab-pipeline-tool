{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) can be separated into two groups based on serological relationships, presumably governed by the viral capsid structure [[cite:PUB00003132]]. Coding regions of coat proteins have been identified for the MAV-PS1, P-PAV (group 1) and NY-RPV (group 2) isolates of BYDV. Group 1 proteins show 71% sequence similarity to each other, 51% similarity to those of group 2, and a high degree of similarity to those from other luteoviruses (including coat proteins from  Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) [[cite:PUB00004354]] and Potato leafroll virus (PLrV) [[cite:PUB00003129], [cite:PUB00003126]]).</p>\r\n<p>Among luteovirus coat protein sequences in general,  several highly conserved domains can be identified, while other domains differentiate group 1 isolates from group 2 and other luteoviruses. Sequence comparisons between the genomes of  PLrV, BWYV and BYDV have revealed ~65% protein sequence similarity between the capsid proteins of BWYV and PLrV and ~45% similarity between BYDV and PLrV [[cite:PUB00003132]]. The N-terminal regions of these sequences, like those of many plant virus capsid proteins, is highly basic. These regions may be involved in protein-RNA interaction.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7rlm", "name" "Crystal Structure of Potato Leafroll Virus (PLRV) Coat Protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00894" "Luteovirus coat protein"}, "prints" {"PR00915" "LUTEOGP1COAT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Luteovirus group 1 coat protein", "short" "Luteo_coat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 82, "taxa" 213, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6011, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3547, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001517", :literature {"PUB00003132" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Vincent JR" "Ueng PP" "Lister RM" "Larkins BA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
