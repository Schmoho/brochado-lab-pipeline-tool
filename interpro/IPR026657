{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of phosphoproteins which includes proline/serine-rich coiled-coil protein 1 (PSRC1, also known as DDA3) and G2 and S phase-expressed protein 1 (GTSE1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DDA3 is a microtubule-destabilising protein that controls spindle dynamics and mitotic progression by regulating microtubule depolymerases, such as Kif2a and MCAK [[cite:PUB00060907], [cite:PUB00060917]]. Deletion of DDA3 causes spindle hyper-stabilisation, inter-kinectochore tension loss, chromosome congression defects. This leads to unaligned chromosomes at metaphase and the accumulation of CENP-E (a plus end-motor protein) at kinectochore in these chromosomes [[cite:PUB00060917]]. It has also been suggested that DDA3 may participate in p53/TP53-regulated growth suppression [[cite:PUB00060918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21584" "DIFFERENTIAL DISPLAY AND ACTIVATED BY P53 DDA3 /G2 S PHASE EXPRESSED 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proline/serine-rich coiled-coil protein 1/G2 and S phase-expressed protein 1", "short" "DDA3/GTSE-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 569, "taxa" 2071, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1316, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1316, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 855}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026657", :literature {"PUB00060917" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Jang CY" "Fang G."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
