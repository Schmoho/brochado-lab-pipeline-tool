{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The GHMP kinase family is named for galactokinase (G), homoserine kinase (H), mevalonate kinase (M), and phosphomevalonate kinase (P). This entry represents an uncharacterised protein family mainly found in bacteroidetes, that is closely related to mevalonate kinase ([interpro:IPR006205]). Members show several distinctive nearly invariant motifs, including WGLG[ST]SSTL, GGSGYDIA (for which the family is named), and SLGAWGGF.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014721", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5 domain 2-type fold, subgroup", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR020568", "name" "Ribosomal protein uS5 domain 2-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040656" "GYDIA family GHMP kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GHMP kinase GYDIA-like", "short" "GHMP_GYDIA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 449, "taxa" 1612, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1726, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1726, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1354}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047765", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047765", "name" "GHMP kinase GYDIA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
