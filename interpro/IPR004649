{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Whereas bacterial and archaeal RNases H2 are active as single polypeptides, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) homologue, Rnh2Ap, when expressed in Escherichia coli, fails to produce an active RNase H2.

Deletion of any one of the proteins or mutations in the catalytic site in Rnh2A leads to loss of RNase H2 activity [[cite:PUB00044465]].
