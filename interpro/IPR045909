{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the mitochondrial dynamics protein MID49/MID51. Most members of this protein family contain a  Mab-21 domain and are found in chordates.</p>\n\n<p>In humans, MID49 and MID51 are outer membrane proteins involved in the regulation of mitochondrial organisation and required for mitochondrial fission by promoting the recruitment and association of the fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (DNM1L) to the mitochondrial surface independently of the mitochondrial fission FIS1 and MFF proteins. They also regulate DNM1L GTPase activity [[cite:PUB00099297], [cite:PUB00099296], [cite:PUB00099298], [cite:PUB00099300], [cite:PUB00099295]]. Deregulation of these proteins has been linked to human diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension [[cite:PUB00099299]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5x9c", "name" "Crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of human MiD51"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16451" "MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS PROTEINS 49/51 FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial dynamics protein MID49/MID51", "short" "MID49/MID51"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 669, "taxa" 2303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1901, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1901, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045909", :literature {"PUB00099295" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Loson OC" "Song Z" "Chen H" "Chan DC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "Fis1, Mff, MiD49, and MiD51 mediate Drp1 recruitment in mitochondrial fission.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "659-67", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23283981}, "PUB00099296" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Palmer CS" "Osellame LD" "Laine D" "Koutsopoulos OS" "Frazier AE" "Ryan MT."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO Rep", "title" "MiD49 and MiD51, new components of the mitochondrial fission machinery.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "565-73", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21508961}, "PUB00099297" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Bartsakoulia M" "Pyle A" "Troncoso-Chandia D" "Vial-Brizzi J" "Paz-Fiblas MV" "Duff J" "Griffin H" "Boczonadi V" "Lochmuller H" "Kleinle S" "Chinnery PF" "Grunert S" "Kirschner J" "Eisner V" "Horvath R."], "ISO_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "title" "A novel mechanism causing imbalance of mitochondrial fusion and fission in human myopathies.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1186-1195", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29361167}, "PUB00099298" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Palmer CS" "Elgass KD" "Parton RG" "Osellame LD" "Stojanovski D" "Ryan MT."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Adaptor proteins MiD49 and MiD51 can act independently of Mff and Fis1 in Drp1 recruitment and are specific for mitochondrial fission.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "27584-27593", "volume" "288", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23921378}, "PUB00099299" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chen KH" "Dasgupta A" "Lin J" "Potus F" "Bonnet S" "Iremonger J" "Fu J" "Mewburn J" "Wu D" "Dunham-Snary K" "Theilmann AL" "Jing ZC" "Hindmarch C" "Ormiston ML" "Lawrie A" "Archer SL."], "ISO_journal" "Circulation", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Circulation", "title" "Epigenetic Dysregulation of the Dynamin-Related Protein 1 Binding Partners MiD49 and MiD51 Increases Mitotic Mitochondrial Fission and Promotes Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Mechanistic and Therapeutic Implications.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "287-304", "volume" "138", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29431643}, "PUB00099300" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7710", "authors" ["Kalia R" "Wang RY" "Yusuf A" "Thomas PV" "Agard DA" "Shaw JM" "Frost A."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structural basis of mitochondrial receptor binding and constriction by DRP1.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "401-405", "volume" "558", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29899447}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007005", "name" "mitochondrion organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005741", "name" "mitochondrial outer membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024810", "name" "MAB21L/Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-like receptor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR026250", "name" "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-interacting protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045909", "name" "Mitochondrial dynamics protein MID49/MID51", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
