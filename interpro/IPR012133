{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents alpha-hydroxy acid FMN-dependent dehydrogenases, including human glycolate oxidase (GO), L-lactate oxidase (LOX) [[cite:PUB00043804]] and bacterial L-lactate dehydrogenase. GO catalyses the FMN-dependent oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate and glyoxylate to oxalate. The latter is a key metabolite in kidney stone formation. 4-carboxy-5-dodecylsulphanyl-1,2,3-triazole (CDST) is an inhibitor of this enzyme. In contrast to most alpha-hydroxy acid oxidases, including spinach glycolate oxidase, a loop region, known as loop 4, is completely visible when the GO active site contains a small ligand. Since this is an unique structural feature, it has the potential to be a target for drugs to decrease glycolate and glyoxylate levels in primary hyperoxaluria type 1 patients who have the inability to convert peroxisomal glyoxylate to glycine [[cite:PUB00043803]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the fungal protein FUB9 by virtue of sequence similarity to the FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase family. FUB9 is an oxidase that is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of fusaric acid [[cite:PUB00082314]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6gmb", "name" "Structure of human hydroxyacid oxidase 1 bound with FMN and glycolate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02809" "alpha_hydroxyacid_oxid_FMN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000138" "Alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase, FMN-dependent"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase, FMN-dependent", "short" "Alpha-hydoxy_acid_DH_FMN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 98, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7011, "taxa" 25984, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43157, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42577, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31506}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
