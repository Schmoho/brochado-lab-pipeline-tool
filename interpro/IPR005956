{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase ([ec:1.13.11.27]) oxidises 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a tyrosine and phenylalanine catabolite, to homogentisate.

A similar process occurs spontaneously in blood and is haemolytic [[cite:PUB00007915]]. In some bacterial species, this enzyme has been studied as a haemolysin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7vo8", "name" "Structure of AtHPPD complexed with LSY-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF009283" "4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01263" "4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11959" "4-HYDROXYPHENYLPYRUVATE DIOXYGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase", "short" "4OHPhenylPyrv_dOase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 105, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6082, "taxa" 21770, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22964, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16557}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1337", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1337"} {"accession" "GenProp0139", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0139"} {"accession" "GenProp1375", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1375"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
