{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The mammalian TEF and the Drosophila scalloped genes belong to a conserved family of transcriptional factors that possesses a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain. Transcriptional activation by these proteins likely requires interactions with specific coactivators.</p>\n\n<p>In Drosophila, Vestigial (Vg) has a short 25 aa motif necessary and sufficient to interact with Scalloped (Sd) to form a complex. This motif is also present in four mammalian proteins, which are named Vestigial-like proteins (Vgl1-4) [[cite:PUB00007975], [cite:PUB00100081], [cite:PUB00067650]].</p>\n\n<p>In Drosophila, the Vg-Sd complex binds DNA through the Sd TEA/ATTS domain. The Sd-Vg heterodimer is a key regulator of wing development, which directly controls several target genes and is able to induce wing outgrowth when ectopically expressed. This short conserved region is needed for interaction with Sd [[cite:PUB00007975]].</p>\n\n<p>Mammalian Vgl-1 may promote cancer progression [[cite:PUB00100082]]. Vgl-2 interacts with TEF-1 and MEF2 to promote skeletal muscle differentiation [[cite:PUB00100081]]. Vgl-4, is the only member of the Vestigial-like family expressed in the heart [[cite:PUB00067650]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6y20", "name" "Crystal structure of Protein Scalloped (222-440) bound to Protein Vestigial (298-337)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07545" "Vestigial/Tondu family"}, "panther" {"PTHR15950" "TRANSCRIPTION COFACTOR VESTIGIAL-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vestigial family", "short" "Vg_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 846, "taxa" 3315, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3401, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2204}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011520", :literature {"PUB00007975" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Vaudin P" "Delanoue R" "Davidson I" "Silber J" "Zider A."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/126/21/4807", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "TONDU (TDU), a novel human protein related to the product of vestigial (vg) gene of Drosophila melanogaster interacts with vertebrate TEF factors and substitutes for Vg function in wing formation.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "4807-16", "volume" "126", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10518497}, "PUB00067650" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Chen HH" "Mullett SJ" "Stewart AF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
