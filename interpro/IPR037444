{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Glycerol kinase 5 (GK5). Sequence comparison shows members of this group are homologues of bacterial GKs, and they retain all functionally important residues. However, GK-like proteins in this family do not have detectable GK activity. The reason remains unclear. It has been suggested that the conserved catalytic residues might facilitate them performing a distinct function. GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site [[cite:PUB00086963], [cite:PUB00086964], [cite:PUB00086965], [cite:PUB00086966], [cite:PUB00086967]].</p>\n\n<p>These proteins are skin-specific kinases expressed predominantly in sebaceous glands. It can form a complex with the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through their C-terminal regulatory domains, inhibiting SREBP processing and activation [[cite:PUB00154958]]. GK5 also promotes gefitinib resistance by inhibiting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [[cite:PUB00154959]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07793" "nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of metazoan glycerol kinase 5 (GK5) and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol kinase 5", "short" "GK5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 789, "taxa" 3408, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1570, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 997}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
