{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In humans, the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer forms a N6-methyltransferase complex that methylates adenosine residues at the N6 position of some mRNAs and regulates the circadian clock, differentiation of embryonic stem cells and cortical neurogenesis [[cite:PUB00070693], [cite:PUB00070686], [cite:PUB00098087], [cite:PUB00098088], [cite:PUB00098089], [cite:PUB00087330]]. This entry also includes Kar4 from budding yeasts. Kar4 is a phosphoprotein required for expression of karyogamy-specific genes during mating and that it also acts during mitosis and meiosis [[cite:PUB00087338]]. N6-adenosine-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit MTB is another member of this family which associates with MTA, FIP37, VIR and HAKAI to form the so-called 'm6A writer complex' which is essential for adenosine methylation at specific mRNA sequences [[cite:PUB00155425]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5l6d", "name" "Crystal structure of the human METTL3-METTL14 complex bound to SAH"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13107" "N6-ADENOSINE-METHYLTRANSFERASE NON-CATALYTIC SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N6-adenosine-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit METTL14-like", "short" "METTL14-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1589, "taxa" 6037, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2992, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2992, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1914}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045123", :literature {"PUB00070686" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ping XL" "Sun BF" "Wang L" "Xiao W" "Yang X" "Wang WJ" "Adhikari S" "Shi Y" "Lv Y" "Chen YS" "Zhao X" "Li A" "Yang Y" "Dahal U" "Lou XM" "Liu X" "Huang J" "Yuan WP" "Zhu XF" "Cheng T" "Zhao YL" "Wang X" "Rendtlew Danielsen JM" "Liu F" "Yang YG."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cr.2014.3", "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "177-89", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24407421}, "PUB00070693" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Liu J" "Yue Y" "Han D" "Wang X" "Fu Y" "Zhang L" "Jia G" "Yu M" "Lu Z" "Deng X" "Dai Q" "Chen W" "He C."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
