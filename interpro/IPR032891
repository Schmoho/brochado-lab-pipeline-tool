{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine dehydrogenase wecC (also known as RffD) from Enterobacteriaceae. WecC is involved in the Enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis, which is part of bacterial outer membrane biogenesis [[cite:PUB00042837]]. ECA is a specific surface antigen (polysaccharide) shared by all members of the Enterobacteriaceae and is restricted to this family [[cite:PUB00060945]]. It catalyses the four-electron oxidation of UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (UDP-ManNAc), reducing NAD+ and releasing UDP-N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid [[cite:PUB00076991]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02029" "UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine dehydrogenase [wecC]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-N-acetyl-D-mannosamine dehydrogenase WecC", "short" "WecC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 115, "taxa" 1154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1448, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1448, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1097}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
