{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pro-opiomelanocortin is present in high levels in the pituitary and is processed into 3 major peptide families: adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH); alpha-, beta- and gamma-melanocyte- stimulating hormones (MSH); and beta-endorphin [[cite:PUB00002596]]. ACTH regulates the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids and, to some extent, aldosterone in the adrenal cortex. It is synthesised and released in response to corticotrophin-releasing factor at times of stress (i.e. heat, cold, infection, etc.), its release leading to increased metabolism. The action of MSH in man is poorly understood, but it may be involved in temperature regulation [[cite:PUB00002596]]. Full activity of ACTH resides in the first 20 N-terminal amino acids, the first 13 of which are identical to alpha-MSH [[cite:PUB00002596], [cite:PUB00000465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00383" "MELANOCORTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pro-opiomelanocortin", "short" "PMOC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 444, "taxa" 4455, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24796, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5315, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3438}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001941", :literature {"PUB00002596" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Bateman A" "Solomon S" "Bennett HP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
