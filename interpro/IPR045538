{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Contractile injection systems (CISs) are cell-puncturing nanodevices that share ancestry with contractile tail bacteriophages. This entry represents a group of proteins found mostly in bacteria as part of the Photorhabdus virulence cassette (PVC), one group of extracellular CISs [[cite:PUB00097484]].</p>\n\n<p>This protein is the tape measure which dictates the length of the syringe tail. It is found in low copy number and is most likely not present in the mature syringes. Deletion of the tape measure protein Pvc14 from P. asymbiotica resulted in large variations in the length of the syringes [[cite:PUB00097484]]. The N and C-terminal domains of these proteins are well conserved, but they have a wide length variation in the central region.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19268" "Contractile injection system tape measure protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Contractile injection system tape measure protein", "short" "CIS_TMP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 400, "taxa" 2143, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1768, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045538", :literature {"PUB00097484" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jiang F" "Li N" "Wang X" "Cheng J" "Huang Y" "Yang Y" "Yang J" "Cai B" "Wang YP" "Jin Q" "Gao N."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Cryo-EM Structure and Assembly of an Extracellular Contractile Injection System.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "370-383.e15", "volume" "177", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30905475}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045538", "name" "Contractile injection system tape measure protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 56, "alignment:full" 627}}}
