{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides). GldJ is a lipoprotein linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) [[cite:PUB00045360]]. Knockouts of GldJ abolish the gliding phenotype. GldJ is homologous to GldK. This model represents the GldJ homologue in Cytophaga hutchinsonii and several other species which is of shorter architecture than that found in C. johnsonae and is represented by [interpro:IPR019865]. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilisation in the model species C. johnsonae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042095", "name" "Sulfatase-modifying factor enzyme superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016187", "name" "C-type lectin fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03530" "gliding motility lipoprotein GldJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility-associated lipoprotein GldJ-short", "short" "Glid_motil-assoc_GldJ-short"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 113, "taxa" 418, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 294, "sets" 0, "proteins" 294, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 208}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019868", :literature {"PUB00045360" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Braun TF" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
