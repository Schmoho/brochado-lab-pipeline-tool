{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Effector Associated Constant Component 1 (EACC1) is a component of a membrane-associated two-gene conflict system, a class of NTP-dependent biological conflict systems. It is found either a standalone domain or fused to Effector-associated domains  EAD1 or EAD2. It is comprised of a single conserved TM helix with short, N- and C-terminal extensions. It is predicted to insert into the membrane and protrude beyond both the outer and inner layers of the bilayer [[cite:PUB00098776]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19953" "Effector Associated Constant Component 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Effector Associated Constant Component 1", "short" "EACC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 488, "taxa" 1602, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1911, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1910, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1310}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045428", :literature {"PUB00098776" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kaur G" "Burroughs AM" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Highly regulated, diversifying NTP-dependent biological conflict systems with implications for the emergence of multicellularity.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32101166}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045428", "name" "Effector Associated Constant Component 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 97, "alignment:full" 803}}}
