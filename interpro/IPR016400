{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents Rev protein from Ovine/caprine lentiviruses [[cite:PUB00042679]]. The Rev protein escorts unspliced or incompletely spliced viral pre-mRNAs (late transcripts) out of the nucleus of infected cells. These pre-mRNAs carry a recognition sequence called Rev responsive element (RRE) located in the env gene, that is not present in fully spliced viral mRNAs (early transcripts) [[cite:PUB00042680]]. This function is essential since most viral proteins are translated from unspliced or partially spliced pre-mRNAs, which cannot exit the nucleus by the pathway used by fully processed cellular mRNAs. Rev protein is a homomultimer when bound to RRE, its multimeric assembly being essential for activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003867" "Rev protein, Ovine/caprine lentivirus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rev protein, Ovine/caprine lentivirus", "short" "Rev_lentivir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016400", :literature {"PUB00042679" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Nekhai S" "Jeang KT."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.2217/17460913.1.4.417", "medline_journal" "Future Microbiol", "title" "Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression: role of cellular factors for Tat and Rev.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "417-26", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17661632}, "PUB00042680" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Prater CE" "Saleh AD" "Wear MP" "Miller PS."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/oli.2007.0082", "medline_journal" "Oligonucleotides", "title" "Allosteric inhibition of the HIV-1 Rev/RRE interaction by a 3'-methylphosphonate modified antisense oligo-2'-O-methylribonucleotide.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "275-90", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17854268}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0050658", "name" "RNA transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016400", "name" "Rev protein, Ovine/caprine lentivirus", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
