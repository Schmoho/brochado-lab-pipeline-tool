{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Pep5 (also known as Vacuolar biogenesis protein END1 and vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 11, Vps11) from fungi, and its homologues from plants and animals. Pep5 is a peripheral vacuolar membrane protein required for protein trafficking and vacuole biogenesis [[cite:PUB00073491], [cite:PUB00153717]]. It is also identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates histone protein levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00073489]]. Human Vps11 may play a role in vesicle-mediated protein trafficking [[cite:PUB00073490]].</p>\n\n<p>S.cerevisiae END1 mutants  described as four vacuolar protein sorting mutants (class C vps) were found to lack a morphologically distinguishable and functional vacuole.  These mutants internalise but do not degrade alpha-factor [[cite:PUB00154369]]. They were also partly defective for mating. These response defects of END1 mutants were attributed to partial defects in signal transduction [[cite:PUB00154369]]. The effects of these mutant defects were linked to the importance of a functional vacuole for optimal response to pheromone.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF007860" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 11", "short" "VPS11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2065, "taxa" 7068, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5558, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3289, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2083}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
