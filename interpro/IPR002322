{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochromes c (cytC) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes [[cite:PUB00053356]]. <p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC.</p>\n\n<p>Class III comprises the low redox potential multiple haem cytochromes: cyt C7 (trihaem), C3 (tetrahaem), and high-molecular-weight cytC, HMC (hexadecahaem), with only 30-40 residues per haem group. The haem c groups, all bis-histidinyl coordinated, are structurally and functionally nonequivalent and present different redox potentials in the range 0 to -400 mV [[cite:PUB00003572]]. The 3D structures of a number of cyt C3 proteins have been determined. The proteins consist of 4-5 α-helices and 2 β-strands wrapped around a compact core of four non-parallel haems, which present a relatively high degree of exposure to the solvent. The overall protein architecture, haem plane orientations and iron-iron distances are highly conserved [[cite:PUB00003572]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1hh5", "name" "cytochrome c7 from Desulfuromonas acetoxidans"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036280", "name" "Multiheme cytochrome superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00609" "CYTOCHROMEC3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c, class III", "short" "Cyt_c_III"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 74, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 225, "taxa" 1777, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11362, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2845, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2169}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002322", :literature {"PUB00000610" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ambler RP."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
