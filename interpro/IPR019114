{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family comprises lipoproteins from gamma proteobacterial species: pullulanase secretion protein PulS protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae ([swissprot:P20440]), the lipoprotein OutS protein of Erwinia chrysanthemi ([swissprot:Q01567]) and the functionally uncharacterised type II secretion protein EtpO ([swissprot:Q7BSV3]) from Escherichia coli O157:H7. PulS and OutS have been shown to interact with and facilitate insertion of secretins into the outer membrane, suggesting a chaperone-like, or piloting function for members of this family. These proteins consist of 4 Î± helices arranged into a slightly elongated, C-shaped helical bundle. Within PulS, the helices form a binding groove which interact with a disordered region on another protein, PulD, to form a PulS-PulD complex. PulD then oligomerises into a dodecameric outer membrane complex in the formation of a type II secretion system [[cite:PUB00097456]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In addition to the PulS/OutS proteins this entry also includes other functionally uncharacterised proteins, such as YacC from Escherischia coli ([swissprot:P0AA95]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4a56", "name" "Crystal structure of the type 2 secretion system pilotin from Klebsiella Oxytoca"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038432", "name" "PulS/OutS-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF037975" "YacC family pilotin-like protein"}, "pfam" {"PF09691" "Type II secretion system pilotin lipoprotein (PulS_OutS)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperone lipoprotein, PulS/OutS-like", "short" "Chap_lipoprot_PulS/OutS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 1187, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1432, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1432, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1068}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019114", :literature {"PUB00097456" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Tosi T" "Nickerson NN" "Mollica L" "Jensen MR" "Blackledge M" "Baron B" "England P" "Pugsley AP" "Dessen A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Pilotin-secretin recognition in the type II secretion system of Klebsiella oxytoca.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1422-32", "volume" "82", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22098633}, "PUB00104493" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Francetic O" "Belin D" "Badaut C" "Pugsley AP."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Expression of the endogenous type II secretion pathway in Escherichia coli leads to chitinase secretion.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "6697-703", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11118204}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019114", "name" "Chaperone lipoprotein, PulS/OutS-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005699", "name" "Chaperone lipoprotein, PulS/OutS", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 144}}}
