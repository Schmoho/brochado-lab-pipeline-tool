{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of calcium-dependent phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C1 enzymes from bacteria and fungi. It includes Streptomyces antibioticus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C1 (SaPLC1) [[cite:PUB00080647]] and similar proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typical bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, EC 4.6.1.13) catalyzes Ca2+-independent hydrolysis of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PI) to produce phosphorylated myo-inositol and diacylglycerol (DAG). The catalytic mechanism is based on general base and acid catalysis utilizing two well conserved histidines, and consists of two steps, a phosphotransfer and a phosphodiesterase reaction. In contrast, SaPLC1 is the first known natural Ca2+-dependent bacterial PI-PLC [[cite:PUB00080650]]. It is more closely related to the eukaryotic PI-PLCs rather than the typical bacterial PI-PLCs. It participates in PI metabolism to generate myo-inositol-1-phosphate and myo-inositol-1:2-cyclic phosphate simultaneously [[cite:PUB00080651]]. SaPLC1 and other members in this subfamily have two Ca2+-chelating amino acid substitutions which convert them from metal-independent enzymes to metal-dependent bacterial PI-PLC. Additionally, SaPLC1 active site utilizes a mechanism of amino acid juxtaposition, swapping amino acid positions, to adapt a calcium binding pocket and maintain more ideal active site geometry to support efficient catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3h4x", "name" "Structure of a Ca+2 dependent Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Enzyme from Streptomyces antibioticus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017946", "name" "PLC-like phosphodiesterase, TIM beta/alpha-barrel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08589" "Catalytic domain of Streptomyces antibioticus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C1-like proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF16670" "Phosphoinositide phospholipase C, Ca2+-dependent"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoinositide phospholipase C, Ca2+-dependent", "short" "PI-PLC-C1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 40, "proteomes" 833, "taxa" 3303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3017, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2946, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2163}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032075", :literature {"PUB00080647" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Iwasaki Y" "Niwa S" "Nakano H" "Nagasawa T" "Yamane T."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
