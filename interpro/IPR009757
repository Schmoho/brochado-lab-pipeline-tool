This protein physically binds host FHC, resulting in the reduction of FHC protein levels in host cells. The reduction of FHC concentration further inhibits the accumulation of reactive oxygen in host cells, leading to reduced apoptosis [[cite:PUB00097765]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07038" "Circovirus 2, anti-apoptotic ORF4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Circovirus 2, anti-apoptotic ORF4", "short" "Circovirus2_Orf4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 35, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009757", :literature {"PUB00097765" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Lv Q" "Guo K" "Zhang G" "Zhang Y."], "ISO_journal" "J Gen Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Gen Virol", "title" "The ORF4 protein of porcine circovirus type 2 antagonizes apoptosis by stabilizing the concentration of ferritin heavy chain through physical interaction.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1636-1646", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27030984}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0052150", "name" "symbiont-mediated perturbation of host apoptosis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009757", "name" "Circovirus 2, anti-apoptotic ORF4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
