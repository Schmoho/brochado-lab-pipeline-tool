{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes PHD-containing proteins 1-3/5/6 from plants (PHD1-3/5-6), such as ASI1-immunoprecipitated protein 2 (AIPP2, also known as PHD3), protein PARALOG OF AIPP2 (PAIPP2, also known as PHD2) [[cite:PUB00153328]]. Members of this entry together with AIPP3/BDT1, cooperate to form a BAH-PHD bivalent histone reader complex able to read histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and low-methylated H3K4 histone marks in order to regulate transcription, especially to prevent early flowering. It promotes AIPP3/BDT1 binding to H3K27me3 [[cite:PUB00153328], [cite:PUB00153327]]. Plants missing all PHD finger-containing proteins (e.g. PHD1, PAIPP2/PHD2, AIPP2/PHD3, PHD4, PHD5 and PHD6) exhibit an increased expression of flowering genes leading to an early flowering phenotype under long-day conditions as well as growth retardation [[cite:PUB00153328]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33304" "PTHR33304"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PHD finger-containing protein 1-3/5-6", "short" "PHD1-3/5-6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 926, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3783, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3783, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1834}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049914", :literature {"PUB00153327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang YZ" "Yuan J" "Zhang L" "Chen C" "Wang Y" "Zhang G" "Peng L" "Xie SS" "Jiang J" "Zhu JK" "Du J" "Duan CG."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20089-0", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Coupling of H3K27me3 recognition with transcriptional repression through the BAH-PHD-CPL2 complex in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "6212", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33277495}, "PUB00153328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Qian F" "Zhao QY" "Zhang TN" "Li YL" "Su YN" "Li L" "Sui JH" "Chen S" "He XJ."], "ISO_journal" "J Integr Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13067", "medline_journal" "J Integr Plant Biol", "title" "A histone H3K27me3 reader cooperates with a family of PHD finger-containing proteins to regulate flowering time in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "787-802", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33433058}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0140566", "name" "histone reader activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0034244", "name" "negative regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049914", "name" "PHD finger-containing protein 1-3/5-6", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
