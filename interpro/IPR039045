{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SCHIP-1 is a coiled-coil protein that specifically associates with schwannomin in vitro and in vivo. The product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumour suppressor gene, known as schwannomin or merlin, is involved in NF2-associated and sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas. It is closely related to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family members, which link membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. Association with SCHIP-1 can be observed only with some naturally occurring mutants of schwannomin, or a schwannomin spliced isoform lacking exons 2 and 3, but not with the schwannomin isoform exhibiting growth-suppressive activity [[cite:PUB00034952]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes IQ motif containing J-Schwannomin-Interacting Protein 1 (IQCJ-SCHIP-1), an isoform of the SCHIP-1.
