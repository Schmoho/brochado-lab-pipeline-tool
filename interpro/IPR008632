{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Parasitic nematodes produce at least two structurally novel classes of small helix-rich retinol- and fatty-acid-binding proteins that have no counterparts in their plant or animal hosts and thus represent potential targets for new nematicides. Gp-FAR-1 is a member of the nematode-specific fatty-acid- and retinol-binding (FAR) family of proteins but localises to the surface of the organism, placing it in a strategic position for interaction with the host. Gp-FAR-1 functions as a broad-spectrum retinol- and fatty-acid-binding protein, and it is thought that it is involved in the evasion of primary host plant defence systems [[cite:PUB00011345]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2w9y", "name" "The structure of the lipid binding protein Ce-FAR-7 from Caenorhabditis elegans"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31418" "FATTY-ACID AND RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 1"}, "pfam" {"PF05823" "Nematode fatty acid retinoid binding protein (Gp-FAR-1)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nematode fatty acid retinoid binding", "short" "Gp-FAR-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 304, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1042, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1001, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 672}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008632", :literature {"PUB00011345" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 2", "authors" ["Prior A" "Jones JT" "Blok VC" "Beauchamp J" "McDermott L" "Cooper A" "Kennedy MW."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
