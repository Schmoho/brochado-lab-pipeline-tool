{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this entry are highly conserved in species ranging from archaea to vertebrates and plants [[cite:PUB00020303]]. The family contains several Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS, OMIM 260400) proteins from both mouse and humans. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical features that include pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, haematological dysfunction and skeletal abnormalities. It is characterised by bone marrow failure and leukemia predisposition [[cite:PUB00045126]]. SBDS is required for the assembly of mature ribosomes and ribosome biogenesis [[cite:PUB00076340]].</p>\n\n<p>Homologue of SBDS from budding yeast is known as Sdo1, which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in ribosome maturation. Together with the EF-2-like GTPase RIA1 (EfI1), it triggers the GTP-dependent release of TIF6 from 60S pre-ribosomes in the cytoplasm, allowing the assembly of mature ribosomes [[cite:PUB00076339]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fsw", "name" "Structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus SBDS protein at 1.9 Angstrom"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037188", "name" "Ribosome maturation protein Sdo1/SBDS, central domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00291" "ribosome assembly factor SBDS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome maturation protein Sdo1/SBDS", "short" "Sdo1/SBDS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2353, "taxa" 11189, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7049, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7049, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4659}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00974", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00974"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002140", :literature {"PUB00045126" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Menne TF" "Goyenechea B" "Sanchez-Puig N" "Wong CC" "Tonkin LM" "Ancliff PJ" "Brost RL" "Costanzo M" "Boone C" "Warren AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
