{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GDP-mannose glycosyl hydrolase (AKA GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase (GDPMH)) is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. This class of enzymes is unique from other members of the superfamily in two aspects. First, it contains a modified Nudix signature sequence. The slight changes to the conserved sequence motif, GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V, are believed to contribute to the removal of all magnesium binding sites but one, retaining only the metal site that coordinates the pyrophosphate of the substrate. Secondly, it is not a pyrophosphatase that substitutes at a phosphorus; instead, it hydrolyzes nucleotide sugars such as GDP-mannose to GDP and mannose, cleaving the phosphoglycosyl bond by substituting at a carbon position [[cite:PUB00080155], [cite:PUB00055108], [cite:PUB00080156], [cite:PUB00055109]]. GDP-mannose provides mannosyl components for cell wall synthesis and is required for the synthesis of other glycosyl donors (such as GDP-fucose and colitose) for the cell wall. The importance of GDP-sugar hydrolase activities is thus closely related to the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis. Enzymes in this family are believed to regulate the concentration of GDP-mannose and GDP-glucose in the bacterial cell wall [[cite:PUB00030842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rya", "name" "Crystal Structure of the E. coli GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase in complex with GDP and MG"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037599" "GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase", "short" "GDPMH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 172, "taxa" 1646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1863, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1531}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
