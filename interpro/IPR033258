{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The EID family members have been identified as a family of negative regulators of cellular differentiation. The family consists of EID-1 (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1, also known as EP300-interacting inhibitor of differentiation 1), EID2, and EID-3/EID-2B. EID-1 seems to inhibit differentiation by blocking p300 histone acetyltransferase activity, while EID-2 inhibits differentiation through binding to class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) [[cite:PUB00078274]]. EID-3 acts both as inhibitor of CBP/p300-dependent transcription [[cite:PUB00062983]] and can also blocks muscle differentiation by binding to class I HDACs [[cite:PUB00078280]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15556" "EP300-INTERACTING INHIBITOR OF DIFFERENTIATION 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EP300-interacting inhibitor of differentiation", "short" "EID"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 120, "taxa" 416, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 375, "sets" 0, "proteins" 375, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 240}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033258", :literature {"PUB00078280" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sasajima Y" "Tanaka H" "Miyake S" "Yuasa Y."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
