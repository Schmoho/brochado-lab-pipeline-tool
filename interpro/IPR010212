{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of archaeal proteins found in a single copy per genome. It contains two KH domains and is most closely related to the central region bacterial NusA, a transcription termination factor named for its interaction with phage lambda protein N in Escherichia coli. The proteins required for antitermination by N include NusA, NusB, NusE (ribosomal protein S10), and NusG. This system, on the whole, appears not to be present in the archaea.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2cxc", "name" "Crystal structure of archaeal transcription termination factor NusA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015946", "name" "K homology domain-like, alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01952" "NusA-like transcription termination signal-binding factor"}, "hamap" {"MF_00945_A" "Transcription termination/antitermination protein NusA [nusA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable transcription termination protein NusA, archaeal", "short" "NusA_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 296, "taxa" 2124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2672, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2672, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2213}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010212", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010212", "name" "Probable transcription termination protein NusA, archaeal", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
