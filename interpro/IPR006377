{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Catabolite control protein A is a LacI family global transcriptional regulator found in Gram-positive bacteria. CcpA is involved in repressing carbohydrate utilization genes (e.g. alpha-amylase [amyE], acetyl-coenzyme A synthase [acsA]) and in activating genes involved in transporting excess carbon from the cell (e.g. acetate kinase [ackA], alpha-acetolactate synthase [alsS]). Additionally, disruption of CcpA in Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus xylosus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus pentosus also decreases growth rate, which suggests CcpA is involved in the regulation of other metabolic pathways [[cite:PUB00017688]]. Its structure has been solved [[cite:PUB00065438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2o20", "name" "Crystal structure of transcription regulator CcpA of Lactococcus lactis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01481" "catabolite control protein A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Catabolite control protein A", "short" "CcpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 823, "taxa" 2867, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2748, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2748, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2183}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006377", :literature {"PUB00017688" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Luesink EJ" "van Herpen RE" "Grossiord BP" "Kuipers OP" "de Vos WM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
