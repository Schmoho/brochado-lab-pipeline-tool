{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>POU class 2 homeobox associating factor 3 (protein OCAT2, also known as colorectal cancer-associated protein 2 (COLCA2)) is expressed in cytoplasm of many cell types of epithelial (normal and tumoral), lymphoid, myeloid, mesenchymal and other origins and has orthologs in multiple mammals. It is a transcriptional coactivator that specifically associates with POU2F3 and forms a complex that drives the development of tuft cells, a rare a rare chemosensory cells that coordinate immune and neural functions within mucosal epithelial tissues [[cite:PUB00101325]]. It has been suggested to have critical functions in suppressing tumor formation in epithelial cells. High levels of OCAT2 in immune and other cells of the micro-environment may also provide protection against cancer cell growth [[cite:PUB00093823]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36689" "COLORECTAL CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "POU class 2 homeobox associating factor 3", "short" "OCAT2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 502, "taxa" 1705, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 710, "sets" 0, "proteins" 710, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 498}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043265", :literature {"PUB00093823" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Peltekova VD" "Lemire M" "Qazi AM" "Zaidi SH" "Trinh QM" "Bielecki R" "Rogers M" "Hodgson L" "Wang M" "D'Souza DJ" "Zandi S" "Chong T" "Kwan JY" "Kozak K" "De Borja R" "Timms L" "Rangrej J" "Volar M" "Chan-Seng-Yue M" "Beck T" "Ash C" "Lee S" "Wang J" "Boutros PC" "Stein LD" "Dick JE" "Gryfe R" "McPherson JD" "Zanke BW" "Pollett A" "Gallinger S" "Hudson TJ."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
