{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>YjbH is a family of Gram-negative β-barrel outer-membrane lipoproteins that act as putative porins. YbjH is one of four gene-products expressed from an operon, yjbEFGH, which is regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay in a RcsA-dependent manner, similar to that of other exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways. It is highly possible that the yjbEFGH operon encodes a system involved in EPS secretion since none of the products is predicted to have enzymic activity, the products are all secreted and YbjH and F are predicted to be β-barrel lipoproteins similar to porins. It may be that the operon products play some role in biofilm formation and/or matrix production [[cite:PUB00075422]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06082" "Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein YbjH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein YbjH", "short" "YbjH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 859, "taxa" 4356, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6272, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5794, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4660}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010344", :literature {"PUB00075422" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Bleichner F" "Meuret G."], "ISO_journal" "Dtsch.
