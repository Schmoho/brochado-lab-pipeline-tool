{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Verrucomicrobium spinosum and Chthoniobacter flavus, a four-gene operon that includes proteins with an N-terminal signal sequence for cleavage and methylation recurs many times. Each operon is likely to encode a membrane complex, the function of which is unknown. This entry represents a long protein from this putative membrame complex, with members averaging about 1300 amino acids. The N-terminal region includes an apparent signal sequence. The function is unknown. Most cassettes are adjacent to an unusually large protein with both an outer membrane autotransporter region and PEP-CTERM putative protein-sorting motif.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02600" "Verru_Chthon cassette protein A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Verru/Chthon cassette protein A", "short" "Verru/Chthon_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 70, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 202, "sets" 0, "proteins" 170, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 50}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0663", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0663"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019840", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019840", "name" "Verru/Chthon cassette protein A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
