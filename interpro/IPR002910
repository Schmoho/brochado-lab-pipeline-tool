{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of various plant development proteins which are homologues of Floricaula (FLO) and leafy (LFY) proteins which are floral meristem identity proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>FLO and LFY proteins are floral meristem identity proteins [[cite:PUB00000873], [cite:PUB00001038]]. Mutations in the sequences of these proteins affect flower and leaf development. LFY has been shown to bind semi-palindromic 19-bp DNA elements through its highly conserved C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). In addition to its well-characterized DBD, LFY possesses a second conserved domain at its amino terminus (LFY-N). Crystallographic structure determination shows that LFY-N is a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain that mediates LFY oligomerization. It allows LFY to bind to regions lacking high-affinity LFY-binding sites and to access closed chromatin regions. Experiments revealed that altering the capacity of LFY to oligomerize compromised floral function. It has been suggested that the biochemical properties of the SAM domain are evolutionary conserved in all plant species [[cite:PUB00085053]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038276", "name" "Floricaula/leafy, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36079" "PROTEIN LEAFY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Floricaula/leafy protein", "short" "FLO_LFY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 3749, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4484, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4484, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3827}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002910", :literature {"PUB00000873" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Weigel D" "Alvarez J" "Smyth DR" "Yanofsky MF" "Meyerowitz EM."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(92)90295-N", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "LEAFY controls floral meristem identity in Arabidopsis.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "843-59", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1350515}, "PUB00001038" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Hofer J" "Turner L" "Hellens R" "Ambrose M" "Matthews P" "Michael A" "Ellis N."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
