{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family represents Teichoic acid ribitol-phosphate polymerase TarL from Staphylococcus aureus ([swissprot:Q2G1B8]) and similar sequences from Staphylococcus species. TarL is responsible for the polymerisation of the main chain of the major teichoic acid by sequential transfer of ribitol phosphate units from CDP-ribitol to the second glycerol phosphate attached to the disaccharide linkage unit. It synthesises polymers of more than 40 ribitol phosphate units in length [[cite:PUB00152897], [cite:PUB00153084], [cite:PUB00083233]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043149", "name" "CDP-glycerol glycerophosphotransferase, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041713" "teichoic acid ribitol-phosphate polymerase TarL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Teichoic acid ribitol-phosphate polymerase TarL", "short" "TarL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 52, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 88, "sets" 0, "proteins" 88, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
