{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents NifS, one of several related families of cysteine desulfurase involved in iron-sulphur (FeS) cluster biosynthesis. NifS is part of the NIF (nitrogen fixation) system, and is usually encoded with other nif genes involved in nitrogenase expression and nitrogen fixation. These proteins include a clade nearly always found in extended nitrogen fixation genomic regions, plus a second clade more closely related to the first than to IscS and also part of NifS-like/NifU-like systems. This entry does not cover a more distant clade found in the epsilonproteobacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, also named NifS in the literature. This clade is covered instead by  [interpro:IPR017773].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03402" "cysteine desulfurase NifS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine desulfurase NifS, bacterial/archaeal", "short" "Cys_deSase_NifS_bac/arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1223, "taxa" 6226, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6364, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6364, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4855}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0742", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0742"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
