{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SH3 (src Homology-3) domains are small protein modules containing approximately 50 amino acid residues [[cite:PUB00001025], [cite:PUB00007145]]. They are found in a great variety of intracellular or membrane-associated proteins [[cite:PUB00001644], [cite:PUB00005506], [cite:PUB00004203]] for example, in a variety of proteins with enzymatic activity, in adaptor proteins, such as fodrin and yeast actin binding protein ABP-1.</p>\n\n<p>The SH3 domain has a characteristic fold which consists of five or six β-strands arranged as two tightly packed anti-parallel β-sheets. The linker regions may contain short helices. The surface of the SH3-domain bears a flat, hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket which consists of three shallow grooves defined by conservative aromatic residues in which the ligand adopts an extended left-handed helical arrangement. The ligand binds with low affinity but this may be enhanced by multiple interactions. The region bound by the SH3 domain is in all cases proline-rich and contains PXXP as a core-conserved binding motif. The function of the SH3 domain is not well understood but they may mediate many diverse processes such as increasing local concentration of proteins, altering their subcellular location and mediating the assembly of large multiprotein complexes [[cite:PUB00001031]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group consists of prokaryotic proteins containing one to two SH3_2 domains, but there is currently no experimental data for these proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF034961" "Uncharacterised protein with SH3_2 domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP034961, SH3-2", "short" "UCP034961_SH3_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 150, "taxa" 1276, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1018, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1016, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 714}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014593", :literature {"PUB00001025" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Pawson T" "Schlessingert J."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
