{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family show homology to mononucleotidyl cyclases and to tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins. Members occur next to two other markers of ribosomal peptide modification systems. One is a dehydrogenase related to SagB proteins from thiazole/oxazole modification systems. The other is the putative precursor, related to the nitrile hydratase-related leader peptide (NHLP) and nitrile hydratase alpha subunit families. These systems occur in many species of Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas, among others.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04510" "putative peptide modification system cyclase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative peptide modification system cyclase", "short" "Mod_pep_cyc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 330, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 323, "sets" 0, "proteins" 323, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 220}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030966", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030966", "name" "Putative peptide modification system cyclase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
