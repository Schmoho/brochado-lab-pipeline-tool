Mutations in HMGL cause a human autosomal recessive disorder called primary metabolic aciduria that affects ketogenesis and leucine catabolism and can be fatal due to an inability to tolerate hypoglycemia [[cite:PUB00094269], [cite:PUB00040107]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nds", "name" "Structure of an HMG-CoA lyase from Acenitobacter baumannii in complex with coenzyme A and 3-methylmalate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42738" "HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTARYL-COA LYASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HMG-CoA lyase", "short" "HMGL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7055, "taxa" 25026, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31846, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31846, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23585}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
