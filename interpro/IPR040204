{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry include the putative E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR7, which is found in mammalian spermatozoa, particularly the acrosomal cap and sperm acrosome [[cite:PUB00090700]]. UBR7 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase of the Arg/N-end rule degradation pathway. It recognizes and binds to proteins bearing specific N-terminal residues that are destabilizing according to the N-end rule, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. It may play an important role in spermiogenesis and fertilisation. Homologues are found in plants and fungi, including the uncharacterised protein Mlo2 from fission yeasts. Both UBR7 and Mlo2 contain both a PHD-type and an UBR-type zinc finger.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13513" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE UBR7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR7", "short" "UBR7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2437, "taxa" 8169, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4301, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4301, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2799}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
