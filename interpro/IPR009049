{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL or ASAL, [ec:4.3.2.1]) participates in arginine synthesis in all organisms catalysing the reversible breakdown of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate. The reaction is also part of the urea cycle [[cite:PUB00031471]]. The crystal structures of ASLs from several species have been studied, in particular the duck delta1 and delta2 eye lens crystallins, which are inactive and active homologues of ASL, respectively [[cite:PUB00026654]]. ASL is a member of the Lyase class I family, these proteins are active as tetramers. The four active sites of the homotetrameric enzyme are each formed by residues from three different subunits. In humans, mutations in ASAL result in the autosomal recessive disorder argininosuccinic aciduria [[cite:PUB00080874]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents argininosuccinate lyase and includes avian delta crystallins whose biological role is to provide the optically clear cellular protein of the eye lens.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9ggi", "name" "Crystal structure of argininosuccinate lyase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtASL)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008948", "name" "L-Aspartase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01359" "Argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase, ASAL)"}, "panther" {"PTHR43814" "ARGININOSUCCINATE LYASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00006" "Argininosuccinate lyase [argH]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00838" "argininosuccinate lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Argininosuccinate lyase", "short" "Argininosuccinate_lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10848, "taxa" 40790, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48970, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48967, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36652}, "pathways" 231}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1300", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1300"} {"accession" "GenProp1481", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1481"} {"accession" "GenProp1253", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1253"} {"accession" "GenProp0117", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0117"} {"accession" "GenProp1320", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1320"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
