{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial lipopolysachharides (LPS) are glycolipids that make up the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria. Though LPS moleculesare variable, they all show the same general features: an outer polysaccharide which is attached to the lipid component, termed lipid A [[cite:PUB00033945]]. The polysaccharide component consists of a variable repeat-structure polysaccharide known as the O-antigen, and a highly conserved short core oligosaccharide which connects the O-antigen to lipid A. Lipid A is a glucosamine-based phospholipid that makes up the membrane anchor region of LPS [[cite:PUB00028103]]. The structure of lipid A is relatively invariant between species, presumably reflecting its fundamental role in membrane integrity. Recognition of lipid A by the innate immune system can lead to a response even at picomolar levels. In some genera, such as Neisseria and Haemophilus, lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are the predominant glycolipids [[cite:PUB00033946]]. These are analogous to LPS except that they lack O-antigens, with the LOS oligosaccharide structures limited to 10 saccharide units.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents a narrow clade of acyltransferases, nearly all of which transfer a lauroyl group to KDO2-lipid IV-A, a lipid A precursor; these proteins are termed lipid A biosynthesis lauroyl acyltransferase, lpxL. An exception is a closely related paralog of E. coli lpxL, LpxP, which acts in cold shock conditions by transferring a palmitoleoyl rather than lauroyl group to the lipid A precursor. Members of this family are homologous to the family of acyltransferases responsible for the next step in lipid A biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00015506]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02207" "LpxL/LpxP family Kdo(2)-lipid IV(A) lauroyl/palmitoleoyl acyltransferase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01942" "Lipid A biosynthesis lauroyltransferase [lpxL]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid A biosynthesis lauroyl/palmitoleoyl acyltransferase", "short" "Lipid_A_LpxL_LpxP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 874, "taxa" 4949, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7162, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7161, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5388}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1647", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1647"} {"accession" "GenProp0204", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0204"} {"accession" "GenProp1325", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1325"} {"accession" "GenProp1397", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1397"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
