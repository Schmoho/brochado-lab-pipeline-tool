{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are esterases, lipases, and (possibly) other hydrolases of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold. The Bacillus stearothermophilus (Geobacillus stearothermophilus) member, Est, has been characterised as a carboxylesterase ([ec:3.1.1.1]) involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics [[cite:PUB00016164]], and the Bacillus sp. H-257 member has been characterised as monoacylglycerol lipase ([ec:3.1.1.23]) [[cite:PUB00016083]].</p>\n\n<p>The alpha/beta hydrolase fold is found in a wide range of enzymes with different catalytic functions [[cite:PUB00004484]]. These enzymes operate on different substrates, and may lack detectable sequence similarity. Nevertheless, they share structural similarity (an open twisted β sheet surrounded on both sides by α helices) and the arrangement of three catalytic residues (the \"catalytic triad\"): a nucleophile (usually Ser), an acid (usually Asp), and histidine [[cite:PUB00016005], [cite:PUB00004958]]. The functional roles of the triad residues are as follows: the sidechain group at the Ser position serves as a nucleophilic centre, the His sidechain acts as a general base and is hydrogen bonded to the carboxylic group of the Asp sidechain. Together, His and Asp form a charge relay system [[cite:PUB00016121]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tqh", "name" "Covalent Reaction intermediate Revealed in Crystal Structure of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus Carboxylesterase Est30"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017388" "Esterase/lipase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Esterase/lipase", "short" "Esterase_lipase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2119, "taxa" 8486, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10761, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9956, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7621}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
