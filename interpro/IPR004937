{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry include low-affinity urea transporters found in the erythrocytes and kidneys of higher organisms. The erythrocyte proteins carry the clinically important Kidd (Jk) blood group antigens which help determine blood type. The two commonest forms are Jk(a) and Jk(b), which arise from a single residue variation at position 280; aspartate in Jk(a) and asparagine in Jk(b) [[cite:PUB00033929]]. A much rarer phenotype, Jk(null), arises when the protein is not expressed on the erythrocyte surface, and is linked to a urine-concentrating defect [[cite:PUB00033930]]. The Kidd blood group is clinically significant as Jk antibodies can cause acute transfusion reactions and haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), where the mother's body creates antibodies against the foetal blood cells. HDN associated with Jk antibodies is generally mild, but fatal cases can occur [[cite:PUB00033931]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bacterial proteins in this entry also appear to be involved in urea transport, promoting its entry into the cell [[cite:PUB00033932]]. This uptake of urea can be advantageous for bacteria as its hydrolysis by urease generates ammonium which is an efficient source of nitrogen and, through its buffering capacity, can also provide resistance to acidic conditions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029020", "name" "Ammonium/urea transporter", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03253" "Urea transporter"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016502" "Urea transporter"}, "panther" {"PTHR10464" "UREA TRANSPORTER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urea transporter", "short" "Urea_transporter"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 57, "proteomes" 1243, "taxa" 6563, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6800, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6293, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4462}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0814", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0814"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004937", :literature {"PUB00033929" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Olives B" "Merriman M" "Bailly P" "Bain S" "Barnett A" "Todd J" "Cartron JP" "Merriman T."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
