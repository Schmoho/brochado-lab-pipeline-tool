{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Vinculin is a eukaryotic protein that seems to be involved in the attachment of the actin-based microfilaments to the plasma membrane. Vinculin is located at the cytoplasmic side of focal contacts or adhesion plaques [[cite:PUB00000977]]. In addition to actin, vinculin interacts with other structural proteins such as talin and alpha-actinins.</p>\n\n<p>Vinculin is a large protein of 116kDa (about a 1000 residues). Structurally the protein consists of an acidic N-terminal domain of about 90kDa separated from a basic C-terminal domain of about 25kDa by a proline-rich region of about 50 residues. The central part of the N-terminal domain consists of a variable number (3 in vertebrates, 2 in Caenorhabditis elegans) of repeats of a 110 amino acids domain.</p>\n\n<p>Alpha-catenins are proteins of about 100kDa which are evolutionary related to vinculin [[cite:PUB00004758]]. Catenins are proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of a variety of cadherins. The association of catenins to cadherins produces a complex which is linked to the actin filament network, and which seems to be of primary importance for cadherins cell-adhesion properties. Three different types of catenins seem to exist: alpha, beta, and gamma. In terms of their structure the most significant differences are the absence, in alpha-catenin, of the repeated domain and of the proline-rich segment.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dow", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF A CHIMERA OF BETA-CATENIN AND ALPHA-CATENIN"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01044" "Vinculin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vinculin/alpha-catenin", "short" "Vinculin/catenin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 71, "domain_architectures" 102, "proteomes" 1066, "taxa" 4499, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 17030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13342, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8364}, "pathways" 62}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006077", :literature {"PUB00000977" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Otto JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Motil.
