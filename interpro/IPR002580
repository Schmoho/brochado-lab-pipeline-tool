{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of the human herpes virus protein UL24 and its orthologues, which are universally present in avian, mammalian and reptilian herpes viruses. Though the functions of these proteins are not known, computational analysis suggests that they may belong to the restriction endonuclease-like fold superfamily, which contains a variety of endonucleases, DNA repair enzymes and exonucleases [[cite:PUB00033393]]. Proteins in this entry contain an absolutely conserved PD-(D/E)XK motif thought to be critical for nucleotide-cleaving activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01646" "Herpes virus proteins UL24 and UL76"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL24", "short" "Herpes_UL24"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 79, "taxa" 388, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 544, "sets" 0, "proteins" 543, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002580", :literature {"PUB00033393" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Knizewski L" "Kinch L" "Grishin NV" "Rychlewski L" "Ginalski K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
