{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The neuropeptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFamide) is a potent cardioactive neuropeptide in Lymnaea stagnalis [[cite:PUB00006244]]. FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) was first demonstrated to be cardioactive in several molluscan species. FMRFamide is now known to be cardioexcitatory in mammals, to inhibit morphine-induced antinociception, and to block morphine-, defeat-, and deprivation-induced feeding [[cite:PUB00006239]]. <p>Thirteen neuropeptides varying in length from 7 to 11 residues and ending C-terminally in -Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (calliFMRFamides 1-13) and one dodecapeptide ending in -Met-Ile-Arg-Phe-NH2 (calliMIRFamide 1) have been isolated from thoracic ganglia of the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria. Results indicate that the N terminus (in addition to the C terminus as previously found for FMRFamides of other organisms) is crucial for at least some biological activities [[cite:PUB00006274]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01581" "FMRFamide related peptide family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FMRFamide-related peptide-like", "short" "FMRFamid-related_peptide-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1602, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5235, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1243, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 762}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002544", :literature {"PUB00006244" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Linacre A" "Kellett E" "Saunders S" "Bright K" "Benjamin PR" "Burke JF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
