{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of vesicle-fusing ATPases includes NSF, an essential protein in membrane fusion events. NSF plays the role of a chaperone by activating SNAP receptor proteins (SNAREs) so that they can participate in membrane fusion. For subsequent rounds of fusion, the SNARE complex must be disassembled, and NSF, in conjunction with SNAPs, utilises its intrinsic ATPase activity to provide a driving force that disassembles SNARE complexes [[cite:PUB00090154], [cite:PUB00090155], [cite:PUB00080105]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qcs", "name" "N-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE SENSITIVE FACTOR (NSF)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23078" "VESICULAR-FUSION PROTEIN NSF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesicle-fusing ATPase", "short" "Vesicle-fus_ATPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2664, "taxa" 9249, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7228, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7228, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4485}, "pathways" 44}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
