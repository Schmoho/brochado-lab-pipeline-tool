{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are multiheme cytochrome c proteins of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A and several other archaeal methanogens. All members have N-terminal signal peptides and are presumed to act in electron transfer reactions associated with methanogenesis. Putative heme-binding motifs include five (or six) CXXCH motifs, a CXXXCH motif, and a CXXXXCH motif. These proteins show multiple regions of local homology, in the same order, with multiheme cytochrome c proteins such as octaheme tetrathionate reductase from Shewanella.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036280", "name" "Multiheme cytochrome superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04314" "methanogenesis multiheme c-type cytochrome"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methanogenesis multiheme c-type cytochrome", "short" "Methanoheme_cyt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 92, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 63, "sets" 0, "proteins" 63, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 58}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027594", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027594", "name" "Methanogenesis multiheme c-type cytochrome", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
