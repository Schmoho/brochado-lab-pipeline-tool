{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the neurogenic mastermind-like proteins 1-3 (MAML1-3) from chordates, which act as critical transcriptional co-activators for Notch signalling [[cite:PUB00045311], [cite:PUB00044098]]. Notch receptors are cleaved upon ligand engagement and the intracellular domain of Notch shuttles to the nucleus. MAMLs form a functional DNA-binding complex with the cleaved Notch receptor and the transcription factor CSL, thereby regulating transcriptional events that are specific to the Notch pathway. MAML proteins may also play roles as key transcriptional co-activators in other signal transduction pathways as well, including: muscle differentiation and myopathies (MEF2C) [[cite:PUB00045312]], tumour suppressor pathway (p53) [[cite:PUB00045313]] and colon carcinoma survival (beta-catenin) [[cite:PUB00045314]]. MAML proteins could mediate cross-talk among the various signalling pathways and the diverse activities of the MAML proteins converge to impact normal biological processes and human diseases, including cancers.</p>\n\n<p>They consist of an N-terminal domain which adopt an elongated kinked helix that wraps around ANK and CSL forming one of the complexes in the build-up of the Notch transcriptional complex for recruiting general transcription factors [[cite:PUB00033511], [cite:PUB00100172]]. This N-terminal domain is responsible for its interaction with the ankyrin repeat region of the Notch proteins NOTCH1 [[cite:PUB00045315]], NOTCH2 [[cite:PUB00045316]], NOTCH3 [[cite:PUB00045317]] and NOTCH4. It forms a DNA-binding complex with Notch proteins and RBPSUH/RBP-J kappa/CBF1, and also binds CREBBP/CBP [[cite:PUB00045318]] and CDK8 [[cite:PUB00045319]]. The C-terminal region is required for transcriptional activation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046370", "name" "Neurogenic mastermind-like, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15692" "MASTERMIND-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mastermind-like 1-3", "short" "MAML1-3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 727, "taxa" 2699, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3018, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3018, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2003}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046369", :literature {"PUB00100172" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Fryer CJ" "Lamar E" "Turbachova I" "Kintner C" "Jones KA."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Mastermind mediates chromatin-specific transcription and turnover of the Notch enhancer complex.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1397-411", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12050117}, "PUB00045313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Zhao Y" "Katzman RB" "Delmolino LM" "Bhat I" "Zhang Y" "Gurumurthy CB" "Germaniuk-Kurowska A" "Reddi HV" "Solomon A" "Zeng MS" "Kung A" "Ma H" "Gao Q" "Dimri G" "Stanculescu A" "Miele L" "Wu L" "Griffin JD" "Wazer DE" "Band H" "Band V."], "ISO_journal" "J.
