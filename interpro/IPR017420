The final step in the biosynthesis of the vitamin involves the dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine catalyzed by riboflavin synthase. The second product, 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, is recycled in the biosynthetic pathway by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase [[cite:PUB00043427]].
