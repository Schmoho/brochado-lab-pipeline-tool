{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit CHAF1B (also known as p60 subunit) from animals, and its homologues such as Cac2 from yeasts and FAS from Arabidopsis. They are a component of the chromatin assembly factor complex (CAF-1), an evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric chaperone comprised of p150, p60 and p48 subunits, mediates DNA synthesis-coupled chromatin assembly in S-phase. It is also involved in chromatin assembly following DNA repair [[cite:PUB00098126], [cite:PUB00043990]]. In plants, the loss of activity of the CAF1 pathway causes delay and arrest of the cell cycle during pollen development [[cite:PUB00098127]]. The CAF1 complex is also required for stable maintenance of telomeres and 45S rDNA in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00098128]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15271" "CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR 1 SUBUNIT B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit Cac2/CHAF1B/FAS2", "short" "PTHR15271"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2551, "taxa" 8638, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4444, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4444, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2808}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045145", :literature {"PUB00098127" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chen Z" "Tan JL" "Ingouff M" "Sundaresan V" "Berger F."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Chromatin assembly factor 1 regulates the cell cycle but not cell fate during male gametogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "65-73", "volume" "135", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18045841}, "PUB00098126" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Martini E" "Roche DM" "Marheineke K" "Verreault A" "Almouzni G."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "Recruitment of phosphorylated chromatin assembly factor 1 to chromatin after UV irradiation of human cells.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "563-75", "volume" "143", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9813080}, "PUB00043990" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Tang Y" "Poustovoitov MV" "Zhao K" "Garfinkel M" "Canutescu A" "Dunbrack R" "Adams PD" "Marmorstein R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
