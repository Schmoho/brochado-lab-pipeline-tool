{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes SATB1/2 from animals. SATB1 is a global gene regulator that acts as a \"docking site\" for several chromatin remodeling enzymes and recruits corepressors (HDACs) or coactivators (HATs) directly to promoters [[cite:PUB00089942]]. SATB1 can bind DNA specifically to the consensus SATB1-binding sequence (CSBS) consisting of two 5'-TAATA-3' half-sites that are arranged as inverted repeats flanking a central cytosine or guanine. It can also bind DNA non-specifically [[cite:PUB00089949]]. SATB1 has been shown to bind to the nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer [[cite:PUB00089944]], while SATB2 has been shown to bind to the MARs of the endogenous immunoglobulin micro locus in pre-B cells and enhances gene expression [[cite:PUB00089945]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SATB1 is an identified oncogene, its increased expression is associated with poor prognosis in many cancers [[cite:PUB00089948]]. Mutations in the SATB2 gene cause SATB2-associated syndrome (SAS), characterised by developmental delay/intellectual disability with absent or limited speech development, craniofacial abnormalities, behavioral problems, dysmorphic features, and palatal and dental abnormalities [[cite:PUB00089946], [cite:PUB00089947]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3tuo", "name" "Crystal structure of N-terminal domain of DNA-binding protein satb1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038224", "name" "SATB, ULD domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038216", "name" "SATB, CUTL domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15116" "DNA-BINDING PROTEIN SATB FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding protein SATB1/SATB2", "short" "SATB1/SATB2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 949, "taxa" 3721, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3777, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3777, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2410}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039673", :literature {"PUB00089942" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pavan Kumar P" "Purbey PK" "Sinha CK" "Notani D" "Limaye A" "Jayani RS" "Galande S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
