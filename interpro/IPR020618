{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 6 (AK6) is a broad-specificity nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase that catalyses the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between nucleoside triphosphates and monophosphates [[cite:PUB00030703]]. AMP and dAMP are the preferred substrates, but CMP and dCMP are also good substrates. All nucleoside triphosphates ATP, GTP, UTP, CTP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP are accepted as phosphate donors. It has also ATPase activity and may have a role in nuclear energy homeostasis. AK6 is involved in regulation of Cajal body (CB) formation [[cite:PUB00068768], [cite:PUB00056952]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes related putative adenylate kinases from archaea.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rkb", "name" "The structure of adrenal gland protein AD-004"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00039" "Putative adenylate kinase"}, "panther" {"PTHR12595" "POS9-ACTIVATING FACTOR FAP7-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 6", "short" "Adenyl_kinase_AK6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2871, "taxa" 10985, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7286, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7284, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5325}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
