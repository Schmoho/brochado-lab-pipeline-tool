{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA-directed RNA polymerases [ec:2.7.7.6] (also known as  DNA-dependent RNA polymerases) are responsible for the polymerisation of ribonucleotides into a sequence complementary to the template DNA. In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases transcribing different sets of genes. Most RNA polymerases are multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits. The core RNA polymerase complex consists of five subunits (two alpha, one beta, one beta-prime and one omega) and is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a \"crab claw\"-like structure with an internal channel running along the full length [[cite:PUB00033173]]. The key functional sites of the enzyme, as defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, are located on the inner wall of this channel.</p>\n\n<p>RNA synthesis follows after the attachment of RNA polymerase to a specific site, the promoter, on the template DNA strand.  The RNA synthesis process continues until a termination sequence is reached. The RNA product, which is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, is known as the primary transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic nuclei contain three distinct types of RNA polymerases that differ in the RNA they synthesise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RNA polymerase I: located in the nucleoli, synthesises precursors of most ribosomal RNAs.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase II: occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises mRNA precursors.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase III: also occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises the precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, the tRNAs, and a variety of other small nuclear and cytosolic RNAs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic cells are also known to contain separate mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA polymerases. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases, whose molecular masses vary in size from 500 to 700kDa, contain two non-identical large (>100kDa) subunits and an array of up to 12 different small (less than 50kDa) subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the short 60-residue long bacterial family that is the beta subunit of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase, likely to be [ec:2.7.7.6] It is membrane-bound and is referred to by the name EpuA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11772" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta/EpuA", "short" "RNApol_su_b/EpuA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 708, "taxa" 2163, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1983, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1983, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1619}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024596", :literature {"PUB00033173" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhang G" "Campbell EA" "Minakhin L" "Richter C" "Severinov K" "Darst SA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81515-9", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase at 3.3 A resolution.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "811-24", "volume" "98", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10499798}, "PUB00000061" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Helmann JD" "Chamberlin MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
