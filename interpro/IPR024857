{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the cappuccino family. In mouse, the cappuccino protein is part of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). The BLOC-1 complex is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. It plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking [[cite:PUB00056682]]. Mutations in cappuchino are characterised by a severe oculocutaneous albinism due to abnormal melanosome formation, and prolonged bleeding due to deficiency of platelet dense body contents [[cite:PUB00056683]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16230" "CAPPUCCINO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cappuccino", "short" "Cappuccino"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 842, "taxa" 3380, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1586, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1586, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1070}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024857", :literature {"PUB00056682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ciciotte SL" "Gwynn B" "Moriyama K" "Huizing M" "Gahl WA" "Bonifacino JS" "Peters LL."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2003-01-0020", "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "Cappuccino, a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, encodes a novel protein that is part of the pallidin-muted complex (BLOC-1).", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "4402-7", "volume" "101", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12576321}, "PUB00056683" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Gwynn B" "Ciciotte SL" "Hunter SJ" "Washburn LL" "Smith RS" "Andersen SG" "Swank RT" "Dell'Angelica EC" "Bonifacino JS" "Eicher EM" "Peters LL."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "Defects in the cappuccino (cno) gene on mouse chromosome 5 and human 4p cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome by an AP-3-independent mechanism.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "4227-35", "volume" "96", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11110696}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024857", "name" "Cappuccino", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
