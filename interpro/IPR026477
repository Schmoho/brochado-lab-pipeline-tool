{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents essentially the full length, ~60 residues, of a two-gene paralogous family from Acidobacterium sp. MP5ACTX8, which are referred as to PExPT-CTERM proteins, the predicted target for protein sorting a cleavage by the exosortase XrtJ. Sequences consist of an N-terminal signal sequence ending in a GC motif, suggestive of the lipoprotein signal sequence, followed immediately by a C-terminal domain sequence with characteristics PEP-CTERM-like sequences, including a PExP motif and a transmembrane helix. Both members occur next to the novel exosortase variant, XrtJ, which contains a novel C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00060405]]. This highly unusual arrangement suggests that PExPT-CTERM proteins may be used as an adaptor molecule to assist in the proper sorting and anchoring of other proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04200" "PExPT-CTERM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "XrtJ-associated TM-motif-TM protein", "short" "Targ_of_XrtJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 26, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1005", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1005"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026477", :literature {"PUB00060405" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Payne SH" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
