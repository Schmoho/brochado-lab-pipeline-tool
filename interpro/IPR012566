{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the leader peptides of the ilvB operon. This operon contains the structural gene for acetohydroxy acid synthase I, an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of valine and isoleucine. The DNA sequence of the ilvB operon promoter-control region encodes a potential leader polypeptide containing 32 amino acids, 12 of which are valine or leucine. A model for the multivalent regulation of this operon by valyl- and leucyl-tRNA is proposed on the basis of the mutually exclusive formation of five strong stem-and-loop structures in the leader mRNA [[cite:PUB00016464]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08049" "IlvB leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IlvB leader peptide", "short" "IlvB_leader"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 630, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 611, "sets" 0, "proteins" 611, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 445}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012566", :literature {"PUB00016464" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Friden P" "Newman T" "Freundlich M."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
