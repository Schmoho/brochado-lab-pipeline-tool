{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dyneins are described as motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, as they can convert energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to force and move along cytoskeletal polymers, such as microtubules. Dyneins generally contain one to three heavy chains, where each heavy chain consists of a C-terminal globular head, a flexible microtubule-binding stalk, and a flexible N-terminal tail known as the cargo-binding domain [[cite:PUB00033356]]. The two categories of dyneins are the axonemal dyneins, which produce the bending motions that propagate along cilia and flagella, and the cytosolic dyneins, which drive a variety of fundamental cellular processes including nuclear migration, organisation of the mitotic spindle, chromosome separation during mitosis, and the positioning and function of many intracellular organelles. Cytoplasmic dyneins contain several accessory subunits ranging from light to intermediate chains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6l4p", "name" "Crystal structure of the complex between the axonemal outer-arm dynein light chain-1 and microtubule binding domain of gamma heavy chain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042219", "name" "Dynein heavy chain AAA lid domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042222", "name" "Dynein heavy chain, domain 2, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043157", "name" "Dynein heavy chain, AAA1 domain, small subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042228", "name" "Dynein heavy chain, linker, subdomain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043160", "name" "Dynein heavy chain, C-terminal domain, barrel region", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46961" "DYNEIN HEAVY CHAIN 1, AXONEMAL-LIKE PROTEIN", "PTHR46532" "MALE FERTILITY FACTOR KL5", "PTHR45703" "DYNEIN HEAVY CHAIN", "PTHR22878" "DYNEIN HEAVY CHAIN 6, AXONEMAL-LIKE-RELATED", "PTHR10676" "DYNEIN HEAVY CHAIN FAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dynein heavy chain", "short" "DHC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 83, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2458, "taxa" 11131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 58203, "sets" 0, "proteins" 58203, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21498}, "pathways" 82}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026983", :literature {"PUB00033356" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Oiwa K" "Sakakibara H."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
