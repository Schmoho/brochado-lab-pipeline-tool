{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diol dehydratase (propanediol dehydratase) and glycerol dehydratase undergo concomitant, irreversible inactivation by glycerol during catalysis [[cite:PUB00013586], [cite:PUB00013587]]. This inactivation is mechanism-based and involves cleavage of the Co-C bond of the cobalamin cofactor, coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl), forming 5 -deoxyadenosine and a modified coenzyme [[cite:PUB00013586]]. Irreversible inactivation of the enzyme results from tight binding to the modified, inactive cobalamin [[cite:PUB00013586], [cite:PUB00013587]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The glycerol-inactivated enzyme undergoes rapid reactivation in the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>(or Mn<sup>2+</sup>) [[cite:PUB00013588]]. Reactivation is mediated by a complex of two proteins: a large subunit (DdrA/PduG, [interpro:IPR009191]) and a small subunit (DdrB/PduH) [[cite:PUB00013589], [cite:PUB00013590]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two subunits of the reactivating factor for glycerol dehydratase have been shown to form a tight complex that serves to reactivate the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme, as well as O<sub>2</sub>-inactivated holoenzyme in vitro [[cite:PUB00013591]]. It is believed that this reactivating factor replaces an enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking inactive cobalamin with a free, adenine-containing active cobalamin [[cite:PUB00013591]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PduG and PduH, part of the propanediol utilization<i>pdu</i>operon, are believed to have a similar function in the reactivation of propanediol dehydratase. PduG was also proposed, on the basis of genetic tests, to be a cobalamin adenosyltransferase involved in the conversion of inactive cobalamin (B12) to AdoCbl [[cite:PUB00013592]]. However, this function has since been shown to belong to another protein, PduO [[cite:PUB00013593]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2d0o", "name" "Structure of diol dehydratase-reactivating factor complexed with ADP and Mg2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010254", "name" "B12-dependent dehydratases, beta subunit", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF011503" "Diol/glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor, small subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diol/glycerol dehydratase reactivating factor, small subunit", "short" "Diol/glycerol_deHydtase_re_ssu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 76, "taxa" 764, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1029, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 815}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009192", :literature {"PUB00013586" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Poznanskaya AA" "Yakusheva MI" "Yakovlev VA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
