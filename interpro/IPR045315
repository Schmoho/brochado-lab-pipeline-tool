{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of mitochondrial carrier proteins, including Mtm1 from budding yeasts and SLC25A39/40 from humans. Mtm1 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) transporter and is involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis [[cite:PUB00098537]]. SLC25A39 and its paralogue SLC25A40 are mitochondrial transporters essential for glutathione import into mitochondria, which is required for the activity and stability of proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters, as well as erythropoiesis [[cite:PUB00100187]]. Knockdown of SLC25A39 in a zebrafish model has been shown to disrupt heme biosynthesis and results in profound anemia [[cite:PUB00077563]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023395", "name" "Mitochondrial carrier domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45760" "FI19922P1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial carrier protein Mtm1-like", "short" "Mtm1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2570, "taxa" 8659, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6693, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6693, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4336}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045315", :literature {"PUB00098537" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Whittaker MM" "Penmatsa A" "Whittaker JW."], "ISO_journal" "Arch Biochem Biophys", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Arch Biochem Biophys", "title" "The Mtm1p carrier and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor trafficking in yeast mitochondria.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "64-70", "volume" "568", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25637770}, "PUB00077563" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Nilsson R" "Schultz IJ" "Pierce EL" "Soltis KA" "Naranuntarat A" "Ward DM" "Baughman JM" "Paradkar PN" "Kingsley PD" "Culotta VC" "Kaplan J" "Palis J" "Paw BH" "Mootha VK."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Metab.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2009.06.012", "medline_journal" "Cell Metab", "title" "Discovery of genes essential for heme biosynthesis through large-scale gene expression analysis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "119-30", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19656490}, "PUB00100187" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7883", "authors" ["Wang Y" "Yen FS" "Zhu XG" "Timson RC" "Weber R" "Xing C" "Liu Y" "Allwein B" "Luo H" "Yeh HW" "Heissel S" "Unlu G" "Gamazon ER" "Kharas MG" "Hite R" "Birsoy K."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "SLC25A39 is necessary for mitochondrial glutathione import in mammalian cells.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "136-140", "volume" "599", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34707288}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:1990542", "name" "mitochondrial transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002067", "name" "Mitochondrial carrier protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR002113", "name" "ADP/ATP carrier protein, eukaryotic type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002167", "name" "Solute carrier family 25 member 16-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045315", "name" "Mitochondrial carrier protein Mtm1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
