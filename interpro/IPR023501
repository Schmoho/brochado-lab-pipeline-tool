{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Archaea mediate a form of post-translational modification of proteins termed sampylation that resembles ubiquitinylation. Proteasome-activating nucleotidase PAN1 from Haloferax volcanii has been shown to associate to sampylated proteins in proteasome-mediated proteolysis [[cite:PUB00070171]].</p>\r\n<p>AAA-ATPase PAN is responsible for recognizing, binding, unfolding and translocation of substrate proteins into the archaeal 20S proteasome core particle. It is essential for opening the gate of the 20S proteasome via an interaction with its C terminus, thereby allowing substrate entry and access to the site of proteolysis. Thus, the C termini of the proteasomal ATPase function like a 'key in a lock' to induce gate opening and therefore regulate proteolysis. The unfolding activity requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, whereas ATP binding alone promotes ATPase-20S proteasome association which triggers gate opening, and supports translocation of unfolded substrates. In addition to ATP, it is able to cleave other nucleotide triphosphates such as CTP, GTP and UTP, but hydrolysis of these other nucleotides is less effective in promoting proteolysis than ATP. Moreover, PAN by itself can function as a chaperone in vitro [[cite:PUB00054260], [cite:PUB00054261], [cite:PUB00054262], [cite:PUB00054263], [cite:PUB00054264]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00553" "Proteasome-activating nucleotidase [pan]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasome-activating nucleotidase PAN", "short" "Nucleotidase_PAN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 1577, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1864, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1590}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023501", :literature {"PUB00054260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wilson HL" "Ou MS" "Aldrich HC" "Maupin-Furlow J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
