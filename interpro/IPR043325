{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein family unique to higher plants that includes cereal-type alpha-amylase inhibitors [[cite:PUB00093862]], lipid transfer proteins [[cite:PUB00000081]], seed storage proteins, and similar proteins [[cite:PUB00093861]]. Proteins in this family are known to play important roles, in defending plants from insects and pathogens, lipid transport between intracellular membranes, and nutrient storage [[cite:PUB00093859]]. Many proteins of this family have been identified as allergens in humans [[cite:PUB00093860]]. These proteins contain a common pattern of eight cysteines that form four disulfide bridges.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036312", "name" "Bifunctional inhibitor/plant lipid transfer protein/seed storage helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33044" "BIFUNCTIONAL INHIBITOR/LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEIN/SEED STORAGE 2S ALBUMIN SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-Amylase Inhibitors (AAI), Lipid Transfer (LT) and Seed Storage (SS) Protein", "short" "LTSS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10205, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10205, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6233}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043325", :literature {"PUB00093861" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kreis M" "Forde BG" "Rahman S" "Miflin BJ" "Shewry PR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
