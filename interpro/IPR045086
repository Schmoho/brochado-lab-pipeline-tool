{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The P-loop guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) control a multitude of biological processes, ranging from cell division, cell cycling, and signal transduction, to ribosome assembly and protein synthesis. GTPases exert their control by interchanging between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, thereby acting as molecular switches. The common denominator of GTPases is the highly conserved guanine nucleotide-binding (G) domain that is responsible for binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides.</p>\n\n<p>Within the translation factor-related (TRAFAC) class of P-loop GTPases, the OBG family comprises a group of high-molecular mass GTPases conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes. The OBG family consists of [[cite:PUB00013952]]:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Obg from bacteria and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00027072], [cite:PUB00022779]].</li>\n<li>DRG from eukaryotes and archaea. DRG proteins may regulate fundamental cellular processes through RNA binding [[cite:PUB00074840]].</li>\n<li>Nog1 from eukaryotes and archaea. It is involved in the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit.</li>\n<li>Yyaf/YchF from bacteria and eukaryotes. It consists of a central G domain, flanked by a coiled-coil domain and a TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, SpoT) domain. Members of this subfamily bind and hydrolyse ATP more efficiently than GTP [[cite:PUB00016351], [cite:PUB00036769]].</li>\n<li>Ygr210 from archaea and fungi.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The OBG-type G domain has a mononucleotide binding fold typical for the P-loop NTPases. A six-stranded mostly parallel β-sheet is flanked by α-helices on both sides. The OBG-type G domain contains five characteristic sequence motifs, termed G1-G5, involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. The G1/Walker A motif (GXXXXGK(S/T)), also referred to as P-loop, helps to position the triphosphate moiety of the bound nucleotide. The G2 (X(T/S)X) and G3/Walker B (hhhDXXG) motifs are involved in the coordination of a Mg(2)+ ion that is required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Specificity in nucleotide binding is conferred by the G4 motif, which has a (N/T)KXD signature in guanine nucleotide binding P-loop NTPases. The G5 motif ((T/G)(C/S)A) supports guanine base recognition [[cite:PUB00027072], [cite:PUB00022779], [cite:PUB00016351], [cite:PUB00036769]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5m04", "name" "Structure of ObgE from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036726", "name" "GTP1/OBG domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11702" "DEVELOPMENTALLY REGULATED GTP-BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "OBG-type GTPase", "short" "OBG_GTPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11766, "taxa" 44502, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 50397, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 37651}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
