{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents one of several distantly related families of phage portal protein. This protein forms a hole, or portal, that enables DNA passage during packaging and ejection. It also forms the junction between the phage head (capsid) and the tail proteins. It functions as a dodecamer of a single polypeptide of average molecular weight of 40-90kDa. This family shows clear homology to sequences represented by [interpro:IPR006427].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01540" "phage portal protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family", "short" "Phage_portal_PBSX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 365, "taxa" 2999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4130, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4130, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3089}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006430", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006944", "name" "Bacteriophage/Gene transfer agent portal protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006427", "name" "Phage portal protein, HK97", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006430", "name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016753", "name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family, Firmicutes", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030935", "name" "Phage portal protein PBSX family, Proteobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
