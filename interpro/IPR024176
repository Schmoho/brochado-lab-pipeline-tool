{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Citrate synthase [ec:2.3.3.1] is a member of a small family of enzymes that can directly form a carbon-carbon bond without the presence of metal ion cofactors. It catalyses the first reaction in the Krebs' cycle, namely the conversion of oxaloacetate and acetyl-coenzyme A into citrate and coenzyme A. This reaction is important for energy generation and for carbon assimilation. The reaction proceeds via a non-covalently bound citryl-coenzyme A intermediate in a 2-step process (aldol-Claisen condensation followed by the hydrolysis of citryl-CoA).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents types I and II citrate synthase enzymes, as well as the related enzymes 2-methylcitrate synthase. 2-methylcitrate ([ec:2.3.3.5]) synthase catalyses the conversion of oxaloacetate and propanoyl-CoA into (2R,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate and coenzyme A (CoA).
