{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents hypothetical proteins such as HI1450, which is believed to act as a putative dsDNA mimic.  HI1450 is an acidic protein with a core structure consisting of α(2)-β(4), where the α-helices are packed against the side of an anti-parallel 4-stranded beta meander. As such, it has some similarity to the dsDNA mimics uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor and nuclease A inhibitor (NuiA), including the distribution of surface charges and the position of the hydrophobic cavity [[cite:PUB00029155]]. DNA mimics act to inhibit or regulate dsDNA-binding proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036763", "name" "Putative dsDNA mimic superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00680" "UPF0263 protein YciU [yciU]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004916" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP004916 type"}, "pfam" {"PF04269" "Protein of unknown function, DUF440"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "dsDNA mimic, putative", "short" "dsDNA_mimic_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 251, "taxa" 1957, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1876, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1876, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1465}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007376", :literature {"PUB00029155" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Parsons LM" "Yeh DC" "Orban J."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10607", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Solution structure of the highly acidic protein HI1450 from Haemophilus influenzae, a putative double-stranded DNA mimic.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "375-83", "volume" "54", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14747986}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007376", "name" "dsDNA mimic, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 239}}}
