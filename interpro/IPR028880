{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ATP-dependent DNA helicase Rrm3 from budding yeasts. It is a 5' to 3' DNA replicative helicase recruited to paused replisomes to promote fork progression throughout nonhistone protein-DNA complexes, naturally occurring impediments that are encountered in each S phase where replication forks pauses [[cite:PUB00066824]]. It shares protein sequence similarities with another DNA helicase, Pif1. However, their functions are different. Rrm3 promotes telomere replication, while Pif1 inhibits telomere replication [[cite:PUB00066824]]. They also have opposite effects on replication fork progression in ribosomal DNA [[cite:PUB00066824]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03177" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase RRM3 [RRM3]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase Rrm3", "short" "Rrm3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 37, "taxa" 154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 78, "sets" 0, "proteins" 78, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 59}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
