{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Initiation factor 2 (IF-2) is one of the three factors required for the initiation of protein biosynthesis in bacteria [[cite:PUB00085958]]. IF-2 promotes the GTP-dependent binding of the initiator tRNA to the small subunit of the ribosome. IF-2 is a protein of about 70 to 95kDa that contains a central GTP-binding domain flanked by a highly variable N-terminal domain and a more conserved C-terminal domain. Some members of this group undergo protein self splicing that involves a post-translational excision of the intein followed by peptide ligation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of IF-2 in facilitating the proper binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA to the ribosomal P site appears to be universally conserved [[cite:PUB00035262]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ncn", "name" "Crystal structure of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5B (517-858) from Chaetomium thermophilum in complex with GTP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036925", "name" "Translation initiation factor IF-2, domain 3 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43381" "TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR IF-2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translation initiation factor IF- 2", "short" "TIF_IF2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 76, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12073, "taxa" 48410, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 62072, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 45582}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
