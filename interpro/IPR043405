{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes chondromodulin (CNMD, also known as Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 1) and chondromodulin-like protein (TNMD, Tenomodulin). CNMD is a transmembrane glycoprotein with two cleaved portions: the N-terminal contains a surfactant protein referred to as a chondrosurfactant protein, and the C-terminal of the precursor protein known as Chm-1. Mature Chm-1 is cleaved from pre-Chm-1 in a furin-like processing site. Mature Chm-1 then can be secreted into the extracellular matrix. Chm-1 is involved in the regulation of tissue angiogenesis, cartilage development and homeostasis. It has also been linked to the onset and progression of diseases, such as osteoarthritis, infective endocarditis, and cancer [[cite:PUB00093940]].</p>\n\n<p>Chondromodulin-like protein, also known as Tenomodulin or CNMD, share protein sequence similarity with pre-Chm-1. However, CNMD is located on the cell surface. It is expressed in dense hypovascular connective tissue. It is involved in cell adhesion, determination of cell morphology, cell aging and bone mineral density [[cite:PUB00093941]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14064" "CHONDROMODULIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chondromodulin/Tenomodulin", "short" "Chondromodulin/Tenomodulin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 649, "taxa" 2202, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1852, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1852, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1296}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043405", :literature {"PUB00093940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Zhu S" "Qiu H" "Bennett S" "Kuek V" "Rosen V" "Xu H" "Xu J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
