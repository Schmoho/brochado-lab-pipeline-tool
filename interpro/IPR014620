{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Thymidylate synthase catalyses the reductive methylation of dUMP to dTMP using methylene tetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor, an essential step in DNA biosynthesis   [[cite:PUB00034730]]. This entry represents a number of proteins that are predicted thymidylate synthases though their function has not been proven. The Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum protein was shown to catalyse the side reactions characteristic of thymidylate synthase, but conversion of dUTP to dTMP was not observed under the experimental conditions used [[cite:PUB00016816]]. Partial sequence data showed no similarity to known thymidylate synthases simply because the region sequenced was from a distinctive N-terminal region not found in other thymidylate synthases. Members of this protein family appear, therefore, to a novel, tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent thymidylate synthase [[cite:PUB00016816]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036926", "name" "Thymidylate synthase/dCMP hydroxymethylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01686" "Putative thymidylate synthase [thyA]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036752" "Predicted thymidylate synthase, MJ0511type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03283" "thymidylate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thymidylate synthase, archaea", "short" "Thymidylate_synthase_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 71, "taxa" 733, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 656, "sets" 0, "proteins" 646, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 543}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
