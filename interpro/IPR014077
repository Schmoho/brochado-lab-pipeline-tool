{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4B (also known as carboxysome operon protein orfB). It distinguishes one of two closely related paralogs encoded by nearby genes in the carboxysome operons of a number of cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophic bacteria. More distantly related proteins are components of other types of shell such as the shell of the ethanolamine degradation organelle. This protein, together with CsoS4A, forms vertices in the carboxysome [[cite:PUB00096632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036677", "name" "EutN/Ccml superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02704" "carboxysome peptide B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4B", "short" "CsoS4B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 600, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 422, "sets" 0, "proteins" 422, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 358}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014077", :literature {"PUB00096632" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Cai F" "Menon BB" "Cannon GC" "Curry KJ" "Shively JM" "Heinhorst S."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The pentameric vertex proteins are necessary for the icosahedral carboxysome shell to function as a CO2 leakage barrier.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e7521", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19844578}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0031469", "name" "bacterial microcompartment", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004992", "name" "Ethanolamine utilization protein EutN/carboxysome shell vertex protein CcmL", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR014076", "name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4A", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR014077", "name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4B", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR046387", "name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CcmL", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
