{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trypanosoma cruzi is a kinetoplastid protozoan parasite of humans and other animals, the causative agent of Chagas disease. It is transmitted via an insect vector, and exists as an intracellular form, the amastigote, or as a trypomastigote form in the blood after infection. In the human host, chronic infection by T. cruzi affects the nervous system and heart, leading to various neurological disorders, damage to the heart muscle and eventually death.</p>\n\n<p>The parasite expresses a variety of virulence factors in order to successfully invade the mammalian or insect host. One of these is unique to the genus Trypanosoma, a sialic acid-metabolising enzyme, dubbed \"trans-sialidase\" [[cite:PUB00011694]], classified as a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 33. The protein catalyses the transfer of host cell sialic acids to acceptor receptors on the protozoan cell membrane, allowing the parasite to evade the immune response and enter the cell undetected. It also acts as the major 85kDa surface antigen of T. cruzi, and exhibits neuraminidase activity similar to that of some pathogenic viruses [[cite:PUB00011694]].</p>\n\n<p>Research into the gene has revealed a massive diversity in the expression of this surface antigen/sialidase [[cite:PUB00011695]]. The variation in its amino acid sequences begs the question why such a successful parasite should need so many different versions of the same virulence factor.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to Trypanosoma spp., this entry also matches a number of bacterial sialidases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036278", "name" "Sialidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01803" "TCSIALIDASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trypanosome sialidase", "short" "Sialidase_trypan"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 92, "taxa" 616, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26299, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4656, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4304}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
