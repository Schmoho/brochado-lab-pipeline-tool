{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (Rubisco activase), which is a metabolic repair enzyme that acts as a molecular chaperone to remodel inhibited active sites of Rubisco, releasing tightly bound sugar phosphates [[cite:PUB00097623]]. This family also includes Protein POST-ILLUMINATION CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE INCREASE (PIFI, At3g15840), which is involved in NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex-mediated chlororespiratory electron transport that mediates electron flow from stromal reductants to the plastoquinone (PQ) pool during chlorophyll fluorescence increase after turning off actinic light. Its C-terminal redox-modulated domain is similar to that of the 46-kD isoform of Rubisco activase [[cite:PUB00097966]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3thg", "name" "Crystal structure of the creosote Rubisco activase C-domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32429" "PTHR32429"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-like", "short" "RCA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 421, "taxa" 2173, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3477, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3477, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2107}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044960", :literature {"PUB00097966" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wang D" "Portis AR Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "A novel nucleus-encoded chloroplast protein, PIFI, is involved in NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex-mediated chlororespiratory electron transport in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1742-52", "volume" "144", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17573537}, "PUB00097623" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Shivhare D" "Ng J" "Tsai YC" "Mueller-Cajar O."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Probing the rice Rubisco-Rubisco activase interaction via subunit heterooligomerization.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "24041-24048", "volume" "116", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31712424}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044960", "name" "Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
