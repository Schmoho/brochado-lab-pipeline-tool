{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are a family of RNA pseudouridine synthases that specify modification sites through guide RNAs.  The function of these H/ACA RNPs is essential for biogenesis of the ribosome, splicing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), maintenance of telomeres and probably for additional cellular processes [[cite:PUB00053435]]. All H/ACA RNPs contain a specific RNA component (snoRNA or scaRNA) and at least four proteins common to all such particles: Cbf5, Gar1, Nhp2 and Nop10. These proteins are highly conserved from yeast to mammals and homologues are also present in archaea [[cite:PUB00088317]]. The H/ACA protein complex contains a stable core composed of Cbf5 and Nop10, to which Gar1 and Nhp2 subsequently bind [[cite:PUB00053436]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Naf1 is an RNA-binding protein required for the maturation of box H/ACA snoRNPs complex and ribosome biogenesis.
