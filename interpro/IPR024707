{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase is a [4FE-4S] protein present in organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis, and plays an important role in the ferredoxin/thioredoxin regulatory chain. It converts an electron signal (photoreduced ferredoxin) to a thiol signal (reduced thioredoxin), regulating enzymes by reduction of specific disulphide groups. It catalyses the light-dependent activation of several photosynthetis enzymes. Ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase is a heterodimer of subunit alpha and subunit beta. Subunit alpha is the variable subunit, and beta is the catalytic chain [[cite:PUB00056148]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the catalytic beta subunit, mainly from Cyanobacteria and plants [[cite:PUB00048788], [cite:PUB00075379]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7bzk", "name" "Crystal structure of ferredoxin: thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin y1 complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036644", "name" "Ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase catalytic beta subunit superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000260" "Ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, catalytic subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase catalytic subunit, cyanobacteria-type", "short" "FTR_bsu_Cyanobacter"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 230, "taxa" 2077, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1063, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1063, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 780}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
