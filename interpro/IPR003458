{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains Bacteriophage T4 gp38 and related bacterial prophage and phage proteins. Gene 38 of phage T4 codes for a protein containing 183 amino acid residues with molecular weight of 22.3kDa. Together with genes 36 and 37, whose products are structural proteins of the fibre distal part, gene 38 forms one transcription unit. Gp38, is a chaperone, which is required for assembly of the distal part of the long fibres and which is absent from the mature phage particle. In the absence of gp38 gp37, which is a component of the distal part of the long tail fibre, fails to oligomerise. The carboxy-terminal region of gp37 forms the tip of the distal fibre that interacts with the cell receptors. Functionally the role of gp38 can be replaced by pTfa of Bacteriophage lambda [[cite:PUB00015588], [cite:PUB00009480], [cite:PUB00015589]].</p>\n\n<p>The function of many of the other members of this family remain to be elucidated.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02413" "Caudovirales tail fibre assembly protein, lambda gpK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage T4, Gp38, tail fibre assembly", "short" "Phage_T4_Gp38_tail_assem"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 24, "proteomes" 314, "taxa" 2633, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10023, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10016, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7783}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003458", :literature {"PUB00015588" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Hashemolhosseini S" "Stierhof YD" "Hindennach I" "Henning U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
