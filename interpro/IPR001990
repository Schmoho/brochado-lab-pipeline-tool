{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Granins (chromogranins or secretogranins) [[cite:PUB00005374]] are a family of acidic proteins present in the secretory granules of a wide variety of endocrine and neuro-endocrine cells. The exact function(s) of these proteins is not yet known but they seem to be the precursors of biologically active peptides and/or they may act as helper proteins in the packaging of peptide hormones and neuropeptides. Apart from their subcellular location and the abundance of acidic residues (Asp and Glu), these proteins do not share many structural similarities. Only one short region, located in the C-terminal section, is conserved in all these proteins, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Chromogranin A (CGA): CGA is a protein of about 420 residues; it is the precursor of the peptide pancreastatin which strongly inhibits glucose- induced insulin release from the pancreas.</li>\r\n<li>Secretogranin 1 (chromogranin B): A sulfated protein of about 600 residues.</li>\r\n<li>Secretogranin 2 (chromogranin C): A sulfated protein of about 650 residues.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Chromogranins and secretogranins together share a C-terminal motif, whereas chromogranins A and B share a region of high similarity in their N-terminal section; this region includes two cysteine residues involved in a disulphide bond.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01271" "Granin (chromogranin or secretogranin)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromogranin A/B/C", "short" "Granin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 644, "taxa" 2175, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3454, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2648, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1870}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00365", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00365"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001990", :literature {"PUB00005374" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Huttner WB" "Gerdes HH" "Rosa P."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
