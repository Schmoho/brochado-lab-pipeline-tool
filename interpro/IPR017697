{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein resemble conventional xanthine dehydrogenase enzymes, which depend on molybdenum cofactor - molybdopterin bound to molybdate with two sulfur atoms as ligands.

The member of this family from Enterococcus faecalis has been shown to act as a xanthine dehydrogenenase, and its activity if dependent on SelD (selenophosphate synthase), selenium, and molybdenum [[cite:PUB00074055], [cite:PUB00045880]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037165", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, molybdopterin binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03311" "selenium-dependent xanthine dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenium-dependent xanthine dehydrogenase", "short" "Xdh"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 1428, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1284, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1284, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 969}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0726", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0726"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017697", :literature {"PUB00045880" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Self WT."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
