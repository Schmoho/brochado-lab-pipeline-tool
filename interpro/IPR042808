{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A), also known as Dectin-1, is a beta-glucan receptor that binds beta-1,3 and beta-1,6 glucans and collaborates with with TLR2 to activate a macrophage's proinflammatory response to a mycobacterial infection [[cite:PUB00093367]]. It is a type II transmembrane protein of the C-type lectin family with single carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) in their extracellular region [[cite:PUB00093369]]. Its cytoplasmic tail contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) that signals in part through the spleen tyrosine kinase and in collaboration with Toll-like receptors. It plays an important role in the host defense against fungal infection [[cite:PUB00093368], [cite:PUB00093370]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bpd", "name" "STRUCTURE OF MURINE DECTIN-1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47218" "C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 7 MEMBER A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-type lectin domain family 7 member A", "short" "CLEC7A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 197, "taxa" 963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 834, "sets" 0, "proteins" 834, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 535}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042808", :literature {"PUB00093368" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Schorey JS" "Lawrence C."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Drug Targets", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Drug Targets", "title" "The pattern recognition receptor Dectin-1: from fungi to mycobacteria.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "123-9", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18288963}, "PUB00093369" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Saijo S" "Iwakura Y."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
