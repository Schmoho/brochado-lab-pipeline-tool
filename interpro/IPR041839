{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arl6 (Arf-like 6) forms a subfamily of the Arf family of small GTPases. Arl6 expression is limited to the brain and kidney in adult mice, but it is expressed in the neural plate and somites during embryogenesis, suggesting a possible role for Arl6 in early development [[cite:PUB00091933]]. Arl6 is also believed to have a role in cilia or flagella function. Several proteins have been identified that bind Arl6, including Arl6 interacting protein (Arl6i), and SEC61beta, a subunit of the heterotrimeric conducting channel SEC61 [[cite:PUB00070036]]. Based on Arl6 binding to these effectors, Arl6 is also proposed to play a role in protein transport, membrane trafficking, or cell signaling during hematopoietic maturation [[cite:PUB00078372]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2h57", "name" "Crystal structure of human ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04157" "Arf-like 6 (Arl6) GTPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6", "short" "Arl6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 747, "taxa" 3057, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1384, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1384, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 927}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041839", :literature {"PUB00091933" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Takada T" "Iida K" "Sasaki H" "Taira M" "Kimura H."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
