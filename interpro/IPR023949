{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA polymerase-associated protein RapA is a transcription regulator that activates transcription by stimulating RNA polymerase (RNAP) recycling [[cite:PUB00055098]]. This stimulation occurs in cases of stress conditions such as supercoiled DNA or high salt concentrations. The protein probably acts by releasing the RNAP, when it is trapped or immobilized on tightly supercoiled DNA however, it does not activate transcription on linear DNA. RapA is probably not involved in DNA repair. The protein has a higher affinity for the core RNAP than for the holoenzyme and its ATPase activity is stimulated by binding to RNAP. RapA belongs to the SNF2/RAD54 helicase family and contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01821" "RNA polymerase-associated protein RapA [rapA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase-associated protein RapA", "short" "Helicase_RapA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 847, "taxa" 4900, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5402, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5402, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4137}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
