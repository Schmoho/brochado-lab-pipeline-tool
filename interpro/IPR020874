{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) shuttles electrons from an unknown electron donor, via FMN and iron-sulphur (Fe-S) centres, to quinones in the respiratory and/or the photosynthetic chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is believed to be plastoquinone. It couples the redox reaction to proton translocation, and thus conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient. Cyanobacterial NDH-1 also plays a role in inorganic carbon-concentration. NDH-1 can be composed of about 15 different subunits, although different subcomplexes with different compositions have been identified which probably have different functions.</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents subunit N.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35515" "NAD(P)H-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE SUBUNIT N, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "pfam" {"PF11909" "NADH-quinone oxidoreductase cyanobacterial subunit N"}, "hamap" {"MF_01353" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit N [ndhN]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase, subunit N", "short" "NAD(P)H-quinone_OxRdtase_su_N"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 432, "taxa" 2163, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1224, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 818}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
