{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>T-Lymphocytes regulate the growth and differentiation of certain lymphopoietic and haemopoietic cells through the release of various secreted protein factors [[cite:PUB00004612]]. These factors, which include interleukin-2 (IL2), are secreted by lectin- or antigen-stimulated T-cells, and have various physiological effects. IL2 is a lymphokine that induces the proliferation of responsive T-cells. In addition, it acts on some B-cells, via receptor-specific binding [[cite:PUB00004618]], as a growth factor and antibody production stimulant [[cite:PUB00000368]]. The protein is secreted as a single glycosylated polypeptide, and cleavage of a signal sequence is required for its activity [[cite:PUB00004618]]. Solution NMR suggests that the structure of IL2 comprises a bundle of 4 helices (termed A-D), flanked by 2 shorter helices and several poorly-defined loops. Residues in helix A, and in the loop region between helices A and B, are important for receptor binding. Secondary structure analysis has suggested similarity to IL4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) [[cite:PUB00000368]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7m2g", "name" "INTERLEUKIN-2 (human) mutant P65K, C125S"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48487" "INTERLEUKIN-2"}, "smart" {"SM00189" "Interleukin-2 family"}, "pfam" {"PF00715" "Interleukin 2"}, "prints" {"PR00265" "INTERLEUKIN2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-2", "short" "IL-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 36, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 131, "taxa" 512, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 302, "sets" 0, "proteins" 302, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 255}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00349", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00349"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000779", :literature {"PUB00004612" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yokota T" "Arai N" "Lee F" "Rennick D" "Mosmann T" "Arai K."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
