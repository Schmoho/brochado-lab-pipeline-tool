{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family resemble cytochrome P450 by homology, but lack a critical heme-binding Cys residue. Members in general are encoded next to a glycosyltransferase gene in a natural products biosynthesis cluster, physically interact with it, and help the glycosyltransferase achieve high specificity while retaining high activity. Many members of this family assist in the attachment of a sugar moiety to a natural product such as a polyketide [[cite:PUB00074327]]. This entry includes Streptomyces venezuelae DesVII and its homologues, such as OleP1 from the oleandomycin-producing\r\nStreptomyces antibioticus, DnrQ from the doxorubicin-producing Streptomyces peucetius, and TylMIII from the tylosin-producing Streptomyces fradiae [[cite:PUB00078609]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036396", "name" "Cytochrome P450 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04515" "P450-derived glycosyltransferase activator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "P450-derived glycosyltranferase activator", "short" "P450-rel_GT_act"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 44, "taxa" 171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 145, "sets" 0, "proteins" 145, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 119}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030958", :literature {"PUB00074327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Moncrieffe MC" "Fernandez MJ" "Spiteller D" "Matsumura H" "Gay NJ" "Luisi BF" "Leadlay PF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
