{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In animals, Targeting Protein for Xklp2 (TPX2)  is critical for mitotic spindle assembly. It has a highly conserved TPX2 central domain, an Aurora-A binding domain and a TPX2_C domain that contains a conserved pentapeptide KLEEK motif. However, in plants besides the TPX2 homologue (with three domains), several proteins were found with only the TPX2_C domain. This group of TPX2_C domain only proteins in plants has been named as WDL (or WVD2-like) proteins, as the first identified member is known as WVD2. These WDL proteins bind to microtubules; however, they have lost the function of targeting Xklp2 and were found to play roles in plant development and responses to environment cues [[cite:PUB00095512], [cite:PUB00097176]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes WAVE-DAMPENED2 (WVD2) and  WDL1-4. WVD2, and its closest paralogue WDL1, modulate both rotational polarity and anisotropic cell expansion during organ growth and also promote clockwise root and etiolated hypocotyls coiling, clockwise leaf curling, but left-handed petiole twisting [[cite:PUB00095512], [cite:PUB00097108]]. WDL3 stabilises microtubules, playing an important role in the regulation of hypocotyl cell elongation. WDL3 levels are regulated by an ubiquitin-26S proteasome-dependent pathway in response to light and functions as a negative regulator of hypocotyl cell elongation in the light [[cite:PUB00097109]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46372" "PROTEIN WVD2-LIKE 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein WAVE-DAMPENED 2-like", "short" "WVD2/WDL1-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 247, "taxa" 951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2229, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2229, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1296}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044806", :literature {"PUB00097176" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sun J" "Ma Q" "Mao T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Ethylene Regulates the Arabidopsis Microtubule-Associated Protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 in Etiolated Hypocotyl Elongation.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "325-37", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26134166}, "PUB00097108" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Perrin RM" "Wang Y" "Yuen CY" "Will J" "Masson PH."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "WVD2 is a novel microtubule-associated protein in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "961-71", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17319849}, "PUB00097109" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Liu X" "Qin T" "Ma Q" "Sun J" "Liu Z" "Yuan M" "Mao T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Light-regulated hypocotyl elongation involves proteasome-dependent degradation of the microtubule regulatory protein WDL3 in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1740-55", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23653471}, "PUB00095512" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yuen CY" "Pearlman RS" "Silo-Suh L" "Hilson P" "Carroll KL" "Masson PH" "Masson PH."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "WVD2 and WDL1 modulate helical organ growth and anisotropic cell expansion in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "493-506", "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12586874}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008017", "name" "microtubule binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000226", "name" "microtubule cytoskeleton organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044806", "name" "Protein WAVE-DAMPENED 2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
