{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenylate kinases (ADK) are phosphotransferases that catalyse the reversible reaction \n<reaction>\nAMP + MgATP = ADP + MgADP\n</reaction>\nan essential reaction for many processes in living cells. Two ADK isozymes have been identified in mammalian cells. These specifically bind AMP and favour binding to ATP over other nucleotide triphosphates (AK1 is cytosolic and AK2 is located in the mitochondria). A third ADK has been identified in bovine heart and human cells [[cite:PUB00001339]], this is a mitochondrial GTP:AMP phosphotransferase, also specific for the phosphorylation of AMP, but can only use GTP or ITP as asubstrate [[cite:PUB00001333]]. ADK has also been identified in different bacterial species and in yeast [[cite:PUB00001818]]. Two further enzymes are known to be related to the ADK family, i.e. yeast uridine monophosphokinase and slime mold UMP-CMP kinase. Within the ADK family there are several conserved regions, including the ATP-binding domains. One of the most conserved areas includes an Arg residue, whose modification inactivates the enzyme, together with an Asp that resides in the catalytic cleft of the enzyme and participates in a salt bridge.</p>\n\n<p>In humans, nine different AK isoenzymes have been identified (AK1-9) [[cite:PUB00068790]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4jl5", "name" "A high resolution structure of Aquifex Adenylate kinase with 2 ADP's"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036193", "name" "Adenylate kinase, active site lid domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01428" "ADK"}, "hamap" {"MF_00235" "Adenylate kinase [adk]"}, "panther" {"PTHR23359" "NUCLEOTIDE KINASE"}, "prints" {"PR00094" "ADENYLTKNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylate kinase/UMP-CMP kinase", "short" "Adenylat/UMP-CMP_kin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 130, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12121, "taxa" 51637, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 88347, "sets" 0, "proteins" 83691, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 60272}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00104", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00104"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
