{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the GTPase activity of Rho-type GTPases, including Rho GTPase-activating protein 17 (RHG17, also known as RICH-1), RHG44 (also known as RICH-2), SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (SH3BP1) and bargin from human which are referred to as BAR-domain RhoGAP subfamily [[cite:PUB00102071]]. Bargin is an alternative splice product consisting of a modified N-terminal BAR domain, an intermediary RhoGAP domain, and a C-terminal partial CIN module and this is the only BAR-RhoGAP subfamily member that lacks a C-terminal polyproline-rich repeat region, which is replaced by the partial CIN phosphatase module [[cite:PUB00102071]].</p>\n\n<p>These proteins convert GTP-bound Rho-type GTPases including RAC1 and CDC42 in their inactive GDP-bound form. SH3BP1 specifically inactivates RAC1 at the leading edge of migrating cells, it regulates the spatiotemporal organization of cell protrusions which is important for proper cell migration [[cite:PUB00102072]]. It is involved in actin remodelling and the formation of epithelial cell junctions, through negative regulation of  CDC42 [[cite:PUB00102073], [cite:PUB00102074]]]. This protein plays a specific role in phagocytosis of large particles as it is specifically recruited by a PI3 kinase/PI3K-dependent mechanism to sites of large particles engagement, where it inactivates RAC1 and/or CDC42 allowing the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton required for engulfment [[cite:PUB00102075]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14130" "3BP-1 RELATED RHOGAP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rho GTPase-activating protein 17/44/SH3BP1-like", "short" "RHG17/44/SH3BP1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1024, "taxa" 4042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6572, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6572, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3909}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047165", :literature {"PUB00102074" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Tata A" "Stoppel DC" "Hong S" "Ben-Zvi A" "Xie T" "Gu C."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "An image-based RNAi screen identifies SH3BP1 as a key effector of Semaphorin 3E-PlexinD1 signaling.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "573-90", "volume" "205", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24841563}, "PUB00102075" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Schlam D" "Bagshaw RD" "Freeman SA" "Collins RF" "Pawson T" "Fairn GD" "Grinstein S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enables phagocytosis of large particles by terminating actin assembly through Rac/Cdc42 GTPase-activating proteins.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "8623", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26465210}, "PUB00102073" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Elbediwy A" "Zihni C" "Terry SJ" "Clark P" "Matter K" "Balda MS."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "Epithelial junction formation requires confinement of Cdc42 activity by a novel SH3BP1 complex.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "677-93", "volume" "198", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22891260}, "PUB00102071" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Huang TY" "Michael S" "Xu T" "Sarkeshik A" "Moresco JJ" "Yates JR 3rd" "Masliah E" "Bokoch GM" "DerMardirossian C."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "A novel Rac1 GAP splice variant relays poly-Ub accumulation signals to mediate Rac1 inactivation.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "194-209", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23223568}, "PUB00102072" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Parrini MC" "Sadou-Dubourgnoux A" "Aoki K" "Kunida K" "Biondini M" "Hatzoglou A" "Poullet P" "Formstecher E" "Yeaman C" "Matsuda M" "Rosse C" "Camonis J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "SH3BP1, an exocyst-associated RhoGAP, inactivates Rac1 at the front to drive cell motility.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "650-61", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21658605}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005096", "name" "GTPase activator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0043547", "name" "positive regulation of GTPase activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047165", "name" "Rho GTPase-activating protein 17/44/SH3BP1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
