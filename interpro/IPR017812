{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents MshC, a l-cysteine:1-D-myo-inosityl 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside ligase enzyme that uses ATP to ligate a Cys residue to a mycothiol precursor molecule, in the second to last step in mycothiol biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00042967]]. This enzyme shows considerable homology to Cys--tRNA ligases, and many proteins are wrongly annotated as such. Mycothiol is found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [[cite:PUB00056790]], Corynebacterium glutamicum (Brevibacterium flavum), Streptomyces coelicolor, and various other members of the Actinobacteria. Mycothiol is an analog of glutathione.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8hfn", "name" "Crystal Structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis MshC in Complex with Compound 7b"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01697" "L-cysteine:1D-myo-inositol 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside ligase [mshC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03447" "cysteine--1-D-myo-inosityl 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mycothiol ligase MshC", "short" "Mycothiol_ligase_MshC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1633, "taxa" 4601, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4392, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4392, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3435}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0753", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0753"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
