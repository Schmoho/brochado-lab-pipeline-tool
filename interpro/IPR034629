{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins constitute a large family of RNA-binding proteins that contain a canonical 35 residue repeat motif. Seven examples have been identified in human mitochondria, and are known to affect mitochondrial translation [[cite:PUB00083801], [cite:PUB00083802]]. One of these is PTCD2, a pentatricopeptide domain (PTCD)-containing protein that affects mitochondrial translation. PTCD2 appears to have a role in processing RNA transcripts involving cytochrome b encoded by mitochondrial DNA [[cite:PUB00083805]]. Disruption in PTCD2 resulted in elevated levels of the unprocessed precursor encoding cytochrome b. PTCD2 has been identified as a target for autoantibodies in neurodegenerative disease and is used as a biomarker for Alzheimer disease [[cite:PUB00083803]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14700" "PENTATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2, MITOCHONDRIAL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein 2, mitochondrial", "short" "PTCD2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 773, "taxa" 3178, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1485, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1004}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034629", :literature {"PUB00083805" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Xu F" "Ackerley C" "Maj MC" "Addis JB" "Levandovskiy V" "Lee J" "Mackay N" "Cameron JM" "Robinson BH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
