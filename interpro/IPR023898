{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a rare family of small proteins, about 50 residues in length, that includes YydF from Bacillus subtilis and SAG 2028 from Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R. Mutational analysis and genomic context show that members of this family likely are modified by a (variably present) radical SAM enzyme, are exported by an ABC transporter, and may have antimicrobial or signalling properties (or both). The member from Bacillus subtilis induces the LiaRS two-component system [[cite:PUB00055041]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04077" "epipeptide YydF family RiPP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative exported peptide YydF-like", "short" "YydF-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 63, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0955", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0955"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023898", :literature {"PUB00055041" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Butcher BG" "Lin YP" "Helmann JD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
