{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are part of the iron-mineralizing encapsulin-associated Firmicute (IMEF) system found in encapsulin nanocompartments [[cite:PUB00100748], [cite:PUB00100750]]. Encapsulins are involved in microbial iron storage and redox metabolism [[cite:PUB00100749], [cite:PUB00100748]]. The IMEF cargo protein ([ec:1.16.3.1]) from Quasibacillus thermotolerans (also known as ferritin-like protein) has been characterised as a ferritin-like iron-binding protein that may play a role in iron mineralization in the encapsulin nanocompartment. It has ferroxidase activity even when encapsulated, the rate is probably controlled by the rate of Fe flux across the nanocompartment pores [[cite:PUB00100748], [cite:PUB00100750]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6n63", "name" "Crystal structure of an Iron binding protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04536" "IMEF encapsulin system ferritin-like cargo protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IMEF encapsulin system ferritin-like cargo", "short" "IMEF_cargo"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 40, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 104, "sets" 0, "proteins" 104, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 88}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0810", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0810"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
