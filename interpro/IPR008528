{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists mainly of uncharacterized proteins from plants.  The unc-13 homologue from<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>has been shown to control tethering of the proton ATPase AHA1 to the plasma membrane, and to be essential for the opening of stomata in repsonse to low levels of carbon dioxide and light.  The unc13-like protein contains two Munc13 homology domains, which are known to mediate synaptic priming in neuronal exocytosis in animals, and may act similarly for plant stomata [[cite:PUB00088405]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31280" "PROTEIN UNC-13 HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein unc-13 homologue", "short" "unc-13_homologue"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 298, "taxa" 1218, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3868, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3868, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2358}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008528", :literature {"PUB00088405" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hashimoto-Sugimoto M" "Higaki T" "Yaeno T" "Nagami A" "Irie M" "Fujimi M" "Miyamoto M" "Akita K" "Negi J" "Shirasu K" "Hasezawa S" "Iba K."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3215", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "A Munc13-like protein in Arabidopsis mediates H+-ATPase translocation that is essential for stomatal responses.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "2215", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23896897}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008528", "name" "Protein unc-13 homologue", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
