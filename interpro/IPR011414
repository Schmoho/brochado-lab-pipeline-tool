{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family belong to a large group that also contains thiamine monophosphate kinase, hydrogenase maturation factor HypE ([interpro:IPR011854]), AIR synthase, FGAM synthase ([interpro:IPR010074]), selenophosphate synthetase ([interpro:IPR004536]), and other groups. In AIR synthase, the N-terminal domain forms the dimer interface of the protein and, upon dimerisation, forms the putative ATP binding domain, while the cleft formed between the N- and C-terminal domains is postulated to be a sulphate binding site [[cite:PUB00014643]]. It could be speculated that similar structure-function relationship exists in members of this family; however, there is no experimental data that proves the biochemical activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036541" "Uncharacterised protein with AIR synthase domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP036541", "short" "UCP036541_AIR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 53, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011414", :literature {"PUB00014643" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Li C" "Kappock TJ" "Stubbe J" "Weaver TM" "Ealick SE."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80182-8", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "X-ray crystal structure of aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (PurM), from the Escherichia coli purine biosynthetic pathway at 2.5 A resolution.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1155-66", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10508786}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006283", "name" "Thiamine-monophosphate kinase-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR009186", "name" "Predicted nickel metalloenzyme maturation factor, AIR synthase-related", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011413", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP036540", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017668", "name" "Methanogenesis marker protein 2", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR024030", "name" "AIR synthase-related protein, sll0787 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR011414", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP036541", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
