{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Schlafen (SLFN) family includes several mouse and human member genes that have been implicated in important functions, such as the control of cell proliferation, induction of immune responses, and the regulation of viral replication [[cite:PUB00070625], [cite:PUB00100755], [cite:PUB00100756], [cite:PUB00100757]]. Mouse and human SLFN proteins are regulated by interferons (IFNs) [[cite:PUB00070625]]. All SLFNs contain an unique Slfn box.
