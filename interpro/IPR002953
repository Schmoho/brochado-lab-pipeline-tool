{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The filoviridae are a group of viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers with a high mortality rate. The family currently contains three viruses: Ebola virus sp., Lake Victoria marburgvirus and Reston ebolavirus, named after their corresponding outbreak regions. They possess negative-stranded RNA genomes, which encode at least 7 proteins. The VP35 protein is found in the genomes of all filoviruses. Its function is presently unknown, but it is thought to share the function of the phosphorylated proteins (polymerase subunits) of rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses due to its position in the genome. There is no evidence however, to suggest that VP35 is phosphorylated [[cite:PUB00005976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5bpv", "name" "Crystal Structure of Zaire ebolavirus VP35 RNA binding domain mutant I278A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043061", "name" "Filoviruses VP35 interferon inhibitory domain, beta-sheet subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043060", "name" "Filoviruses VP35 interferon inhibitory domain, helical subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02097" "Filoviridae VP35"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018326" "Virion protein VP35, Filoviridae type"}, "prints" {"PR01240" "FILOVP35"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Filoviridae VP35 protein", "short" "Filo_VP35"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 101, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 524, "sets" 0, "proteins" 480, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002953", :literature {"PUB00005976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bukreyev AA" "Volchkov VE" "Blinov VM" "Netesov SV."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(93)81107-B", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "The VP35 and VP40 proteins of filoviruses.
