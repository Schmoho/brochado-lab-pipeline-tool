{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glucosamine kinase mostly from Actinobacteria, including GlcN kinase from S. jiangxiensis (known as SjGlcNK). SjGlcNK contains a fold similar to mycobacterial maltokinases. However, SjGlcNK was unable to phosphorylate maltose or aminoglycosides in vitro. Instead, it catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-glucosamine (GlcN) to D-glucosamine 6-phosphate [[cite:PUB00094449]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hwj", "name" "Glucosamine kinase (crystal form A)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02218" "Glucosamine kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucosamine kinase", "short" "GlcN_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 92, "taxa" 276, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 222, "sets" 0, "proteins" 222, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 166}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
