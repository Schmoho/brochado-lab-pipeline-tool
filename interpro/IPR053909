{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry, previously known as DUF6936, represents  FabMG enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) and related proteins. This enzyme is a FabI-type ENR that employs NADH as a coenzyme and mediates resistance to triclosan. FabMG ([swissprot:A0A1C9HA64], [pdbe:6kia]) adopts an α/β structure, with a central parallel β-sheet elaborated with α-helices on both sides ([pdbe:6KI9]). FabMG differs from other related ENRs in sequence and structure. These differences, in particular in the substrate-binding loop and pocket regions in which triclosan binds, could be responsible for the triclosan resistance [[cite:PUB00154385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6kia", "name" "NADH bound structure of FabMG, novel type of Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22046" "Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase FabMG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase FabMG", "short" "FabMG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 105, "taxa" 554, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 343}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053909", :literature {"PUB00154385" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Kim SH" "Khan R" "Choi K" "Lee SW" "Rhee S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15267", "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "A triclosan-resistance protein from the soil metagenome is a novel enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase: Structure-guided functional analysis.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "4710-4728", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32112503}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053909", "name" "Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase FabMG", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 86, "alignment:full" 103}}}
