Cells take up histidine and decarboxylate it using histidine decarboxylase to consume a proton and produce histamine, which the cells excrete. These proteins are all dependent on the pyruvoyl cofactor, which is part of the active site and is located at the amino terminus of the alpha-chain (corresponding to residue 82 of the proenzyme in Lactobacillus sp. 30a), at the break between the beta and alpha chains. This pyruvoyl cofactor facilitates decarboxylation via a Schiff base mechanism resembling that of the more common PLP-dependent decarboxylases. This covalent intermediate allows for resonance stabilisation, facillitaing the decarboxylation step.   The mechanism for this enzyme can be found in MACiE entry M0049 [[cite:PUB00081909], [cite:PUB00081910], [cite:PUB00035745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016104", "name" "Pyruvoyl-dependent histidine/arginine decarboxylase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016105", "name" "Pyruvoyl-dependent histidine/arginine decarboxylase, 3-layer sandwich domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016106", "name" "Histidine decarboxylase proenzyme, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00466" "Pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase"}, "pfam" {"PF02329" "Histidine carboxylase PI chain"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00541" "histidine decarboxylase, pyruvoyl type"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001341" "Histidine decarboxylase, HdcA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine decarboxylase proenzyme", "short" "His_de-COase_proenz"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 390, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 216, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 173}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0872", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0872"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
