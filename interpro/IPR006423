{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a set of bacterial lipoproteins belonging to a larger acid phosphatase family ([interpro:IPR005519]), which in turn belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-dependent hydrolases. Members are found on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. Most members have classic lipoprotein signal sequences. A critical role of this 5'-nucleotidase in Haemophilus influenzae is the degradation of external riboside in order to allow transport into the cell. An earlier suggested role in hemin transport is no longer current. This enzyme may also have other physiologically significant roles [[cite:PUB00017708]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3et4", "name" "Structure of Recombinant Haemophilus Influenzae E(P4) Acid Phosphatase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07534" "molecular class C acid phosphatases, similar to Haemophilus influenzae e (P4) acid phosphatase; belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase superfamily"}, "sfld" {"SFLDG01125" "C1.1: Acid Phosphatase Like"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019271" "Acid phosphatase, class C"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01533" "5'-nucleotidase, lipoprotein e(P4) family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5-nucleotidase lipoprotein e(P4)", "short" "Lipo_e_P4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 741, "taxa" 3917, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3871, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3863, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2882}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1658", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1658"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006423", :literature {"PUB00017708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Kemmer G" "Reilly TJ" "Schmidt-Brauns J" "Zlotnik GW" "Green BA" "Fiske MJ" "Herbert M" "Kraiss A" "Schlor S" "Smith A" "Reidl J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
