{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents thiamine-monophosphate kinase (ThiL), an enzyme that converts thiamine monophosphate into thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP, coenzyme B1), an enzyme cofactor [[cite:PUB00050941], [cite:PUB00016093], [cite:PUB00060746], [cite:PUB00060747]]. Thiamine monophosphate may be derived from de novo synthesis or from unphosphorylated thiamine, known as vitamin B1. The N-terminal domain of ThiL binds ATP and is related to the ATP-binding domains of hydrogen expression/formation protein HypE, the AIR synthases, FGAM synthase and selenophosphate synthetase (SelD). Eukaryotes lack this enzyme, and add pyrophosphate from ATP to unphosphorylated thiamine in a single step.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2yxz", "name" "Crystal structure of tt0281 from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036676", "name" "PurM-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02128" "Thiamine-monophosphate kinase [thiL]"}, "cdd" {"cd02194" "ThiL"}, "panther" {"PTHR30270" "THIAMINE-MONOPHOSPHATE KINASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005303" "Thiamine monophosphate kinase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01379" "thiamine-phosphate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiamine-monophosphate kinase-like", "short" "ThiL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6861, "taxa" 26983, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35080, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35080, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27215}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1457", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1457"} {"accession" "GenProp0254", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0254"} {"accession" "GenProp1725", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1725"} {"accession" "GenProp1289", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1289"} {"accession" "GenProp1219", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1219"} {"accession" "GenProp1144", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1144"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
