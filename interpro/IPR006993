{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins, which contains SH3BGRL3, is functionally uncharacterised. SH3BGRL3 is a highly conserved small protein, which is widely expressed and shows a significant similarity to glutaredoxin 1 (GRX1) of Escherichia coli which is predicted to belong to the thioredoxin superfamily. However, SH3BGRL3 lacks both conserved cysteine residues, which characterise the enzymatic active site of GRX. This structural feature raises the possibility that SH3BGRL3 and its homologues could function as endogenous modulators of GRX activity [[cite:PUB00009708]].</p>\n\n<p>Adapter SH3BGRL from mammals is also included in this entry. This protein may function as a ubiquitin ligase-substrate adapter that bridges proteins together or proteins with mRNAs [[cite:PUB00101359], [cite:PUB00101360]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1t1v", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Glutaredoxin-like Protein SH3BGRL3 at 1.6 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF008142" "SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein"}, "cdd" {"cd03030" "GRX_SH3BGR"}, "pfam" {"PF04908" "SH3-binding, glutamic acid-rich protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SH3-binding, glutamic acid-rich protein", "short" "Glut_rich_SH3-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 66, "proteomes" 1632, "taxa" 5906, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6581, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6568, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4206}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006993", :literature {"PUB00009708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Mazzocco M" "Arrigo P" "Egeo A" "Maffei M" "Vergano A" "Di Lisi R" "Ghiotto F" "Ciccone E" "Cinti R" "Ravazzolo R" "Scartezzini P."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
