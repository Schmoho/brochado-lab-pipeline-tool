The PRC2 complex catalyses di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K37me2/3), which has a repressive role. Even though EZH1 and EZH2 form similar PRC2 complexes, they exhibit contrasting repressive roles. In terms of their expression in mice, EZH1 is more abundant in nonproliferative adult organs, while EZH2 expression is tightly associated with proliferation [[cite:PUB00077181]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4mi5", "name" "Crystal structure of the EZH2 SET domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45747" "HISTONE-LYSINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE E(Z)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH1/2-like", "short" "EZH1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 34, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2091, "taxa" 7708, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8526, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5263}, "pathways" 168}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
