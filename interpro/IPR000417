{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Most microorganisms and plants can synthesise thiamin de novo [[cite:PUB00073181]]. In this de novo pathway, the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties of thiamin are made separately and coupled together to form thiamin phosphate. For the thiazole moiety, 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole (THZ), the key salvage step is phosphorylation to give 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphonooxyethyl)thiazole (THZ-P). The enzyme hydoxyethylthiazole kinase ([ec:2.7.1.50]) is responsible for this step. Hydoxyethylthiazole kinase is encoded by thiM in Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00017550]] and other bacteria [[cite:PUB00101307], [cite:PUB00101306]], and by the C-terminal region of bifunctional proteins in some cases, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which the N-terminal domain corresponds to the bacterial thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase ([ec:2.5.1.3]), ThiE [[cite:PUB00002882], [cite:PUB00058768]]. ThiM constitutes a potential target for pro-drug compounds for antibacterial drug development.</p>\n\n<p>The Arabidopsis and maize genomes encode homologues of ThiM [[cite:PUB00073180]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hpd", "name" "Structure of hydroxyethylthiazole kinase protein from pyrococcus horikoshii OT3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029056", "name" "Ribokinase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01170" "THZ_kinase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00228" "Hydroxyethylthiazole kinase [thiM]"}, "pfam" {"PF02110" "Hydroxyethylthiazole kinase family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00694" "hydroxyethylthiazole kinase"}, "prints" {"PR01099" "HYETHTZKNASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000513" "Hydroxyethylthiazole kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxyethylthiazole kinase", "short" "Hyethyz_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 50, "proteomes" 4136, "taxa" 16419, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14737, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14689, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11256}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1289", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1289"} {"accession" "GenProp1674", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1674"} {"accession" "GenProp1513", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1513"} {"accession" "GenProp1702", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1702"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
