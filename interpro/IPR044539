{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of AAA ATPases, including Pch2 from eukaryotes. It is required for the meiotic checkpoint that prevents chromosome segregation when recombination and chromosome synapsis are defective [[cite:PUB00096383]]. In humans it is linked to Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 3 (MVA3) [[cite:PUB00096384]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes a group of uncharacterised AAA domain-containing proteins from bacteria, including Cap6 (also known as TRIP13) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cap6 is a homologue of Pch2. It is part of the CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system) and functions as an AAA+ ATPase that prevents the CdnD:Cap7:Cap8 complex from synthesizing 2',3',3'-cyclic AMP-AMP-AMP (cAAA), which is a second messenger [[cite:PUB00096608]]. Cap6 binds and disassembles the active CD-NTase:HORMA complex, and hence functions as a negative regulator of CBASS [[cite:PUB00096609]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45991" "PACHYTENE CHECKPOINT PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pachytene checkpoint protein 2-like", "short" "Pch2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2028, "taxa" 7734, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3703, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3703, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2539}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044539", :literature {"PUB00096384" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Yost S" "de Wolf B" "Hanks S" "Zachariou A" "Marcozzi C" "Clarke M" "de Voer R" "Etemad B" "Uijttewaal E" "Ramsay E" "Wylie H" "Elliott A" "Picton S" "Smith A" "Smithson S" "Seal S" "Ruark E" "Houge G" "Pines J" "Kops GJPL" "Rahman N."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Genet", "title" "Biallelic TRIP13 mutations predispose to Wilms tumor and chromosome missegregation.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1148-1151", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28553959}, "PUB00096383" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["San-Segundo PA" "Roeder GS."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Pch2 links chromatin silencing to meiotic checkpoint control.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "313-24", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10319812}, "PUB00096608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Millman A" "Melamed S" "Amitai G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "Diversity and classification of cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling systems.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1608-1615", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32839535}, "PUB00096609" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ye Q" "Lau RK" "Mathews IT" "Birkholz EA" "Watrous JD" "Azimi CS" "Pogliano J" "Jain M" "Corbett KD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "HORMA Domain Proteins and a Trip13-like ATPase Regulate Bacterial cGAS-like Enzymes to Mediate Bacteriophage Immunity.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "709-722.e7", "volume" "77", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31932165}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001270", "name" "ClpA/B family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR010448", "name" "Torsin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017378", "name" "Torsin 1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR013461", "name" "ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit ClpA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017729", "name" "AAA+ ATPase ClpV1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017730", "name" "Chaperonin ClpB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044539", "name" "Pachytene checkpoint protein 2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
