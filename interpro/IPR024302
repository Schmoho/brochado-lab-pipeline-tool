{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilise glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a family of SusD-like proteins, one member of which, BT1043 ([swissprot:Q8A8X4]), is an outer membrane lipoprotein from B. thetaiotaomicron that is involved in host glycan metabolism [[cite:PUB00051695]]. The structures of this and other SusD-homologues in the family are dominated by tetratrico peptide repeats that may facilitate association with outer membrane Î²-barrel transporters required for glycan uptake. The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4puc", "name" "Crystal structure of a SusD homolog (BACUNI_02643) from Bacteroides uniformis ATCC 8492 at 2.00 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011990", "name" "Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12741" "Susd and RagB outer membrane lipoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SusD-like", "short" "SusD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 432, "taxa" 1768, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4536, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4182, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3343}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024302", :literature {"PUB00051695" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Koropatkin N" "Martens EC" "Gordon JI" "Smith TJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi801942a", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Structure of a SusD homologue, BT1043, involved in mucin O-glycan utilization in a prominent human gut symbiont.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1532-42", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19191477}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024302", "name" "SusD-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 19, "alignment:full" 1002}}}
