{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins of this family have been identified in a number of species as a nuclear protein with a cell cycle dependence. Various names have been given to members of this family which include cell cycle protein p38-2G4, also known as proliferation-associated protein PA2G4 [[cite:PUB00074549], [cite:PUB00076723]], curved DNA-binding protein [[cite:PUB00074550]], proliferation-associated protein A, and ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1) [[cite:PUB00049595]]. They constitute the proliferation-associated PA2G4 family, which is structurally homologous to the type II methionine aminopeptidases, but without methionine aminopeptidase activity [[cite:PUB00048899], [cite:PUB00049595]]. ErbB3 binding protein-1 (Ebp1) is a potential regulator of ErbB3 signaling, and is implicated in cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation in many cell types [[cite:PUB00074555], [cite:PUB00074552]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These proteins are classified as non-peptidase homologues in the MEROPS peptidase family M24 (clan MG).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q8k", "name" "The crystal structure of Ebp1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036005", "name" "Creatinase/aminopeptidase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00495" "ErbB3-binding protein EBP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PA2G4 family", "short" "PA2G4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1305, "taxa" 5300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2723, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2723, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1682}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004545", :literature {"PUB00048899" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Kowalinski E" "Bange G" "Bradatsch B" "Hurt E" "Wild K" "Sinning I."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2007.08.024", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "The crystal structure of Ebp1 reveals a methionine aminopeptidase fold as binding platform for multiple interactions.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "4450-4", "volume" "581", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17765895}, "PUB00074549" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Radomski N" "Jost E."], "ISO_journal" "Exp.
