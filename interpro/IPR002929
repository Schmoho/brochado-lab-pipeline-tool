{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists mainly of the Potato leafroll virus (PLrV) read through protein also known as the minor capsid protein. This is generated via a readthrough of open reading frame 3, the coat protein, allowing transcription of open reading frame 5 to give an extended coat protein with a large C-terminal addition or read through domain [[cite:PUB00005598], [cite:PUB00096160]].</p>\n\n<p>The read through protein is essential for the circulative aphid transmission of PLrV [[cite:PUB00005598]] and Beet western yellows virus [[cite:PUB00046133]].
