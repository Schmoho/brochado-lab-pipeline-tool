{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The agouti protein regulates pigmentation in the mouse hair follicle producing a black hair with a subapical yellow band. A highly homologous protein agouti signal protein (ASIP) is present in humans and is expressed at highest levels in adipose tissue where it may play a role in energy homeostasis and possibly human pigmentation [[cite:PUB00010245], [cite:PUB00010246]]. This family also includes the Agouti-related protein (Agrp), involved in energy balance, body weight regulation and metabolism. It interacts with melanocortin receptors MC3R, MC4R and MC5R [[cite:PUB00063799]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Toxin Tbo-IT2 from Oblong running crab spider, which contains an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold with a spatial structure and very similar Cys distribution to agouti-signaling proteins (ASIP) and agouti-related proteins (AGRP) [[cite:PUB00097902]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036836", "name" "Agouti domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05039" "Agouti protein"}, "smart" {"SM00792" "Agouti protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR16551" "AGOUTI RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Agouti", "short" "Agouti"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 633, "taxa" 2291, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2010, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1417}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC60024", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC60024"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007733", :literature {"PUB00010245" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Voisey J" "van Daal A."], "ISO_journal" "Pigment Cell Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0749.2002.00039.x", "medline_journal" "Pigment Cell Res", "title" "Agouti: from mouse to man, from skin to fat.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "10-8", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11837451}, "PUB00010246" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kanetsky PA" "Swoyer J" "Panossian S" "Holmes R" "Guerry D" "Rebbeck TR."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
