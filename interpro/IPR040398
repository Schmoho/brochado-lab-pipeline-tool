It affects genes positively and negatively and is thought to regulate transcription factor IID function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it exists in two prominent forms and consists of at least nine core subunits: the five Not proteins (Not1 to Not5), Caf1, Caf40, Caf130 and Ccr4 [[cite:PUB00044101]]. The Ccr4-Not complex regulates many different cellular functions, including RNA degradation and transcription initiation. It may be a regulatory platform that senses nutrient levels and stress [[cite:PUB00044102]]. Caf1 and Ccr4, are directly involved in mRNA deadenylation, and Caf1p is associated with Dhh1, a putative RNA helicase thought to be a component of the decapping complex [[cite:PUB00010586]].
