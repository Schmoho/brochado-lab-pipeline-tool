{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyses the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-biphosphate, which then enters the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. PFK is a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis [[cite:PUB00013528]].</p>\n\n<p>This family consists of a group of plant and bacterial pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinases related to TP0108 from Treponema  [[cite:PUB00014446]]. The bacterial versions are non-allosteric dimers, while the plant versions are allosteric heterotetramers [[cite:PUB00014390]]. They belong to the PFK domain superfamily of proteins, which also includes prokaryotic ([interpro:IPR012003]) and eukaryotic ATP-dependent PFKs ([interpro:IPR009161]). The membership of this group largely resembles group B1 PFKs [[cite:PUB00014634]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035966", "name" "Phosphofructokinase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000534" "ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase, TP0108 type"}, "hamap" {"MF_01981" "ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase [pfkA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase TP0108-type", "short" "PyroP-dep_PFK_TP0108"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 686, "taxa" 3501, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5004, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4877, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3226}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
