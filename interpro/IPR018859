{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Endocytosis and intracellular transport involve several mechanistic steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For the internalisation of cargo molecules, the membrane needs to bend to form a vesicular structure, which requires membrane curvature and a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton;</li>\n<li>Following its formation, the vesicle has to be pinched off the membrane;</li>\n<li>The cargo has to be subsequently transported through the cell and the vesicle must fuse with the correct cellular compartment.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Members of the Amphiphysin protein family are key regulators in the early steps of endocytosis, involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles by promoting the assembly of a protein complex at the plasma membrane and directly assist in the induction of the high curvature of the membrane at the neck of the vesicle. Amphiphysins contain a characteristic domain, known as the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs)-domain, which is required for their<i>in vivo</i>function and their ability to tubulate membranes [[cite:PUB00014978]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of these proteins suggest the domain forms a crescent-shaped dimer of a three-helix coiled coil with a characteristic set of conserved hydrophobic, aromatic and hydrophilic amino acids.
