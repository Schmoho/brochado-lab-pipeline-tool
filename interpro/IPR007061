{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry, previously known as DUF664, represents the Mycothiol S-transferase (MST) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related proteins mainly found in Actinobacteria. MST binds to and is responsible for the transfer of Mycothiol (MSH) to xenobiotic acceptors. The ability of MST to catalyse this reaction depends on the presence of divalent metal ions and this enzyme exhibits only a residual activity in metal absence [[cite:PUB00158836]]. MST is a member of the DinB-like superfamily ([interpro:IPR034660]). It folds into a canonical four-helical bundle that creates a metal binding site using a combination of three highly conserved coordinating histidine and aspartate residues. It was shown that MST uses Fe2+ as the catalytic metal in vivo [[cite:PUB00158836]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8f5v", "name" "Crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mycothiol S-transferase enzyme in complex with mycothiol and Zn2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR034660", "name" "DinB/YfiT-like putative metalloenzymes", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04978" "Protein of unknown function (DUF664)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mycothiol-S-transferase", "short" "MST-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 59, "proteomes" 1814, "taxa" 5702, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20912, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20897, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15568}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007061", :literature {"PUB00158836" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Jayasinghe YP" "Banco MT" "Lindenberger JJ" "Favrot L" "Palcekova Z" "Jackson M" "Manabe S" "Ronning DR."], "ISO_journal" "RSC Med Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1039/d2md00401a", "medline_journal" "RSC Med Chem", "title" "The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> mycothiol <i>S</i>-transferase is divalent metal-dependent for mycothiol binding and transfer.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "491-500", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36970142}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007061", "name" "Mycothiol-S-transferase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 31, "alignment:full" 7611}}}
