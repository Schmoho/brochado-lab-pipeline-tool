{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents YcgR a member of the T3SS. It acts as a flagellar brake, regulating swimming and swarming in a bis-(3'-5') cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP)-dependent manner. Increasing levels of c-di-GMP lead to decreased motility. YcgR binds 1 c-di-GMP dimer per subunit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YcgR is composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain of unknown function and a C-terminal PilZ domain. The PilZ domain binds c-di-GMP in vitro with an affinity that is high enough to allow it to respond to small changes in intracellular c-di-GMP levels. This domain organisation is conserved in a large number of proteobacteria.  Therefore, the function of YcgR in motility control is likely to be conserved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01457" "Flagellar brake protein YcgR [ycgR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system flagellar brake protein YcgR", "short" "T3SS_YcgR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 433, "taxa" 2406, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2847, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2847, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023787", :literature {"PUB00049330" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Benach J" "Swaminathan SS" "Tamayo R" "Handelman SK" "Folta-Stogniew E" "Ramos JE" "Forouhar F" "Neely H" "Seetharaman J" "Camilli A" "Hunt JF."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601918", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The structural basis of cyclic diguanylate signal transduction by PilZ domains.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "5153-66", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18034161}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0035438", "name" "cyclic-di-GMP binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0071945", "name" "regulation of bacterial-type flagellum-dependent cell motility by regulation of motor speed", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023787", "name" "Type III secretion system flagellar brake protein YcgR", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
