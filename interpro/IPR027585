{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are ribosomally-synthesised and posttranslationally-modified peptide (RiPP) precursors about 30 amino acids in length encoded in the vicinity of PaaA and PaaB homologues. Members include PaaP from Pantoea agglomerans, whose central tripeptide EEN appears to be the source of the mature product, pantocin A. Note, however, that the corresponding residues in Photobacterium sp. SKA34 and Photobacterium asymbiotica are EEK rather than EEN. This family, therefore, resembles the PQQ precursor PqqA as a peptide precursor of an extremely small mature product.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04310" "pantocin A family RiPP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pantocin A family RiPP precursor", "short" "Pantocin_A_RiPP_pre"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 61, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027585", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027585", "name" "Pantocin A family RiPP precursor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
