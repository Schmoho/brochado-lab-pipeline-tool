It has 37 ORFs including B116, whose function is unknown. The structure of B116 reveals a fold consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet flanked on one side by three α helices. Two subunits come together to form a homodimer with a 10-stranded mixed β-sheet, where the topology of the central strands resembles an unclosed β-barrel [[cite:PUB00041899]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2j6c", "name" "crystal structure of AFV3-109, a highly conserved protein from crenarchaeal viruses"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037236", "name" "STIV B116-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08960" "STIV B116-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "STIV B116-like", "short" "STIV_B116-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 86, "taxa" 829, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 357, "sets" 0, "proteins" 357, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 256}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015055", :literature {"PUB00041899" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Larson ET" "Eilers BJ" "Reiter D" "Ortmann AC" "Young MJ" "Lawrence CM."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2007.01.027", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "A new DNA binding protein highly conserved in diverse crenarchaeal viruses.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "387-96", "volume" "363", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17336360}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015055", "name" "STIV B116-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 88}}}
