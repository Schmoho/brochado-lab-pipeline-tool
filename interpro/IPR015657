{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase functions in the putrescine degradation pathway. It catalyses the oxidation of 4 aminobutyraldehyde to 4 aminobutyrate, a neurotransmitter. YdcW encodes gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ABALDH) in the wild-type Escherichia coli (strain K12). It is a tetramer and when coupled with YgjG putrescine transaminase in vitro, putrescine was converted into gamma-aminobutyric acid [[cite:PUB00042939]]. The tetramer is composed of identical subunits. YdcW can also oxidize N-alkyl medium-chain aldehydes, but with a lower catalytic efficiency [[cite:PUB00032275]].  The same enzyme from Arthrobacter sp. utilises both NAD+ and NADP+ as coenzymes. It functions optimally at pH 8.0 [[cite:PUB00043488]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07092" "Escherichia coli NAD+-dependent gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase YdcW-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase", "short" "Aminobutyraldehyde_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1409, "taxa" 5895, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7966, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6048}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
