{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rad52 was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) as a component of the homologous recombination repair pathway and to play an important role in both meiotic and mitotic recombination. The human protein is highly homologous in both structure and function. In the presence of absence of DNA, Rad52 forms ring-shaped oligomers which bind both single and double stranded DNA, stimulating annealing of complimentary DNA strands and promoting ligation of both cohesive and blunt-end fragments. Rad52 may act as a recombination mediator, optimising catalysis of strand exchange by the Rad51 protein.</p>\n\n<p>A C-terminal self-association domain has been identified that mediates formation of higher order oligomers of Rad52 rings. Formation of these oligomers may be important for interaction with more than one DNA molecule [[cite:PUB00007686]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042525", "name" "DNA repair protein Rad52/59/22 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00607" "DNA repair protein, RAD52 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA recombination/repair protein Rad52", "short" "DNA_recomb/repair_Rad52"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1388, "taxa" 4299, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2102, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2102, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1383}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004585", :literature {"PUB00007686" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Lloyd JA" "Forget AL" "Knight KL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
