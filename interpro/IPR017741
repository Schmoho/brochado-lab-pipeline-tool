{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a clade of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases syntenically associated with a family of proposed phosphonatase-like enzymes ([ncbifam:TIGR03351]) and is also found (less frequently) in association with phosphonate transporter components. A likely role for this enzyme involves the oxidative deamination of an aminophosphonate differing slightly from 2-aminoethylphosphonate, possibly 1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonate (see the comments for [ncbifam:TIGR03351]). Many members of the larger FAD-dependent oxidoreductase family act as amino acid oxidative deaminases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03364" "TIGR03364 family FAD-dependent oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, HpnW", "short" "FAD-dependent_OxRdtase_HpnW"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1001, "taxa" 4308, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3728, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3728, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2843}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0736", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0736"} {"accession" "GenProp0241", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0241"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017741", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017741", "name" "FAD-dependent oxidoreductase, HpnW", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
