{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NIMIN1/3 are linked to the salicylic acid-dependent systemic acquired resistance response (SAR), a plant immune response [[cite:PUB00076334]].

NH1 is a transcriptional co-activator that represses NH1-mediated activation. NRR homologues 1, 2 and 3 (RH1, RH2, and RH3) have also been reported to bind to, and repress to varying degrees, NH1-mediated transcriptional activation [[cite:PUB00081467]]. RH1 and RH3, but not RH2, also effectively repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation [[cite:PUB00081467]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33669" "PROTEIN NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF RESISTANCE"}, "pfam" {"PF15699" "NPR1 interacting"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NPR1/NH1-interacting protein", "short" "NPR1/NH1-interacting"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 220, "taxa" 839, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1457, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1445, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 839}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031425", :literature {"PUB00033537" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Weigel RR" "Bauscher C" "Pfitzner AJ" "Pfitzner UM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
