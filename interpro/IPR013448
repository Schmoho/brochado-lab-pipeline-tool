{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains rhamnose mutarotase from Escherichia coli, previously designated YiiL as an uncharacterised protein, and close homologues associated with rhamnose dissimilation operons in other bacterial genomes. Mutarotase is a term for an epimerase that changes optical activity. This enzyme was shown experimentally to interconvert alpha and beta stereoisomers of the pyranose form of L-rhamnose [[cite:PUB00020762]].
