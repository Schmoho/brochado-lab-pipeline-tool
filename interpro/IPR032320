{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of glycosyl hydrolases (GH) from CAZy family 18 that are mainly found in Bacteroidetes, including the endoglycosidase BT1044 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ([swissprot:A0A0P0FQI4]). This protein folds into the canonical (β/α)8 barrel (TIM barrel) fold common to many GH structures, with the N-terminal a discrete extended structure that would orientate the lipoprotein on the cell surface with the active site facing the extracellular environment [[cite:PUB00101017]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16141" "Glycoside hydrolase family 18, BT1044-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase family 18, BT1044-like", "short" "GH18_BT1044-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 84, "taxa" 452, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1325, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1286, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1032}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032320", :literature {"PUB00101017" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Briliute J" "Urbanowicz PA" "Luis AS" "Basle A" "Paterson N" "Rebello O" "Hendel J" "Ndeh DA" "Lowe EC" "Martens EC" "Spencer DIR" "Bolam DN" "Crouch LI."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "Complex N-glycan breakdown by gut Bacteroides involves an extensive enzymatic apparatus encoded by multiple co-regulated genetic loci.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1571-1581", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31160824}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR032320", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase family 18, BT1044-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 225}}}
