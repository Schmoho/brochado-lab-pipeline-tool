{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Respiratory synctial virus (RSV) has two major virion envelope proteins, the fusion F and major attachment G glycoproteins, which are the two viral neutralisation antigens [[cite:PUB00070952]]. This entry represents the major surface glycoprotein G from RSV. G glycoprotein interacts with host CX3CR1, the receptor for the CX3C chemokine fractalkine, to modulate the immune response and facilitate infection [[cite:PUB00070954], [cite:PUB00070953]]. There are two versions of the G protein: the full length G protein (mG), which is anchored by a transmembrane domain near the N terminus; the secreted version (sG), which lacks the transmembrane domain due to an alternative initiation of translation [[cite:PUB00070952]]. The secreted version-sG helps the virus evade antibody-mediated restriction of replication by acting as an antigen decoy [[cite:PUB00070952]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5wn9", "name" "Structure of antibody 2D10 bound to the central conserved region of RSV G"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00802" "Pneumovirus attachment glycoprotein G"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major surface glycoprotein G", "short" "G_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 75, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21104, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21098, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000925", :literature {"PUB00070952" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Bukreyev A" "Yang L" "Fricke J" "Cheng L" "Ward JM" "Murphy BR" "Collins PL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
