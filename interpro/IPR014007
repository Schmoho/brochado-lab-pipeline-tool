{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>One member of this family, as characterised in Klebsiella terrigena [[cite:PUB00017788]], is able to interconvert acetoin + NADH with meso-2,3-butanediol + NAD(+). It is also capable of irreversible reduction of diacetyl with NADH to acetoin. There has been a reuctance to classify the enzyme as either [ec:1.1.1.4], which is (R,R)-butanediol dehydrogenase, or [ec:1.1.1.5], which is acetoin dehydrogenase without a specified stereochemistry [[cite:PUB00017788]].
