{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the non-structural protein NS6 (also known as ORF6, accessory protein 6, or X3 protein), which is highly conserved among SARS-related coronaviruses [[cite:PUB00094122]] (this is distinct from NSP6 which is encoded on the replicase polyprotein). NS6 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum [[cite:PUB00094122]]. It has been reported that NS6 can increase the cellular gene synthesis and it can also induce apoptosis through Jun N-terminal kinase and Caspase-3 mediated stress. This protein can modulate host antiviral responses by inhibiting synthesis and signalling of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) via two complementary pathways. One involves NS6 interaction with host N-Myc (and STAT) interactor (Nmi) protein inducing its degradation via ubiquitin proteasome pathway, suppressing Nmi enhanced IFN signalling. The other pathway suppresses the translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and downstream IFN signalling [[cite:PUB00094123]].</p>\n\n<p>This protein interacts with Rae1 and Nup98 to prevent both nuclear import and export, which renders host cells incapable of responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection [[cite:PUB00100229]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12133" "Betacoronavirus NS6 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Non-structural protein NS6, betacoronavirus", "short" "NS6_bCoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 142, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 219, "sets" 0, "proteins" 219, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022736", :literature {"PUB00100229" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Addetia A" "Lieberman NAP" "Phung Q" "Hsiang TY" "Xie H" "Roychoudhury P" "Shrestha L" "Loprieno MA" "Huang ML" "Gale M Jr" "Jerome KR" "Greninger AL."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 Disrupts Bidirectional Nucleocytoplasmic Transport through Interactions with Rae1 and Nup98.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33849972}, "PUB00094122" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Geng H" "Liu YM" "Chan WS" "Lo AW" "Au DM" "Waye MM" "Ho YY."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "The putative protein 6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus: expression and functional characterization.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "6763-8", "volume" "579", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16310783}, "PUB00094123" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Cheng W" "Chen S" "Li R" "Chen Y" "Wang M" "Guo D."], "ISO_journal" "Virol Sin", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virol Sin", "title" "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein 6 mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation of N-Myc (and STAT) interactor.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "153-61", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25907116}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0044165", "name" "host cell endoplasmic reticulum", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022736", "name" "Non-structural protein NS6, betacoronavirus", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 5}}}
