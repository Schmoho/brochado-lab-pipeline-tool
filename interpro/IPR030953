{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many biosynthesis clusters for secondary metabolites feature a glycosyltransferase gene next to a P450 homologue, often with the P450 lacking a critical heme-binding Cys. These P540-derived sequences seem to be allosteric activators of glycosyltransferases such as the member of this family. This entry represents a set of related glycosyltransferases, many of which can be recognised as activator-dependent from genomic context. Proteins in this entry include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3-alpha-mycarosylerythronolide B desosaminyl transferase eryCIII from Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It catalyzes the conversion of alpha-L-mycarosylerythronolide B into erythromycin D in the erythromycin biosynthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00078600]].</li>\n<li>Aclacinomycin-T 2-deoxy-L-fucose transferase AknK from Streptomyces galilaeus. It is involved in the biosynthesis of the trisaccharide moiety characteristic of the antitumor drug aclacinomycins [[cite:PUB00078601]].</li>\n<li>Aklavinone 7-beta-L-rhodosaminyltransferase AknS from Streptomyces galilaeus. It is involved in the biosynthesis of the anthracycline antitumor agent aclacinomycin A [[cite:PUB00078602]].</li>\n<li>Tylactone mycaminosyltransferase from Streptomyces fradiae. It is involved in the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic tylosin derived from the polyketide lactone tylactone [[cite:PUB00013845]].</li>\n<li>Erythronolide mycarosyltransferase EryBV from Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It is involved in the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin [[cite:PUB00078603]].</li>\n<li>TDP-daunosamine transferase DnrS from Streptomyces peucetius. It is involved in the biosynthesis of the anthracyclines carminomycin and daunorubicin (daunomycin) which are aromatic polyketide antibiotics that exhibit high cytotoxicity and are widely applied in the chemotherapy of a variety of cancers [[cite:PUB00078605]].</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3wad", "name" "Crystal structure of glycosyltransferase VinC involved in the biosynthesis of vicenistatin"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04516" "activator-dependent family glycosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyltransferase, activator-dependent family", "short" "Glycosyl_450act"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 176, "taxa" 579, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 841, "sets" 0, "proteins" 841, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 674}, "pathways" 204}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
