{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>One common form of damage to DNA occurs when alkyl groups become covalently linked to DNA, leading to the formation of mutagenic or toxic lesions. Alkylating agents are ubiquitous in the environment and can also exist endogenously; for example S-adenosylmethionine, a commonly used methyl donor in many cellualr pathways, can produce methylation damage. Given the prevalence of alkylating agents it is not surprising that all cellular organisms studied so far have developed repair systems to deal with DNA alkylation [[cite:PUB00034744]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNA-3-methyladenine glycosylase I (also known as TagI) is part of the broader helix-hairpin-helix DNA repair glycosylase supefamily. It specifically catalyses the release of 3-methylated adenine and, to a lesser extent, guanosine bases from DNA by hydrolysis of the deoxyribose N-glycosidic bond [[cite:PUB00017507], [cite:PUB00022105]]. A phylogenomic study suggests that TagI evolved in, and is specific to, the bacteria [[cite:PUB00034745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ofk", "name" "Crystal Structure of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I (TAG)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011257", "name" "DNA glycosylase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00624" "DNA-3-methyladenine glycosylase I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-3-methyladenine glycosylase I", "short" "Tag"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2866, "taxa" 11808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11633, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8989}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
