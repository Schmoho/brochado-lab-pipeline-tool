{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Transcriptional regulator GfcR and related proteins from archaea. They share protein sequence similarity to the PyrE protein (Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase) from Salmonella typhimurium [[cite:PUB00066200]]. GfcR is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that functions as a regulator of central sugar catabolic pathways [[cite:PUB00153518]]. It acts by binding directly to the promoter region of the regulated genes. In the presence of D-glucose, activates expression of the gene encoding the gluconate dehydratase (gad), which is involved in D-glucose catabolism while In the presence of D-fructose, activates expression of the genes encoding the PTS system EIIC component (ptfC) and the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fba), which are involved in D-fructose uptake and degradation [[cite:PUB00153518]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029057", "name" "Phosphoribosyltransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01214" "PyrE-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulator GfcR", "short" "GfcR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 189, "taxa" 1126, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 960, "sets" 0, "proteins" 960, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 848}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022854", :literature {"PUB00066200" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Bhatia MB" "Vinitsky A" "Grubmeyer C."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00498a009", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Kinetic mechanism of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase from Salmonella typhimurium.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "10480-7", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2271660}, "PUB00153518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Johnsen U" "Ortjohann M" "Reinhardt A" "Turner JM" "Stratton C" "Weber KR" "Sanchez KM" "Maupin-Furlow J" "Davies C" "Schonheit P."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15114", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Discovery of a novel transcriptional regulator of sugar catabolism in archaea.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "224-240", "volume" "120", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37387308}, "PUB00066199" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bitan-Banin G" "Ortenberg R" "Mevarech M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
