{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a probable bifunctional tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein. Its N-termanal domain is homologous to the Kae1/YgjD family, which is involved in tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00059911]]. Its C-terminal region contains a serine/threonine protein kinase domain (STYKS) and is homologous to Bud32. Kae1 and Bud32 are two components of the the KEOPS/EKC complex, which has been implicated in transcription, telomere maintenance and chromosome segregation [[cite:PUB00059910]]. In this archaeal family, it seems that the Kae1 and Bud32 orthologues are fused.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01447" "Probable bifunctional tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036401" "Predicted bifunctional O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase/protein kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable bifunctional tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein", "short" "tRNA_threonyl_synthase/kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 169, "taxa" 934, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 740, "sets" 0, "proteins" 740, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 645}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
