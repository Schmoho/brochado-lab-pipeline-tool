{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha-D-Glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, also known as CDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, is the product of the rfbF gene and produces CDP-D-glucose from alpha-D-Glucose-1-phosphate and MgCTP as substrate [[cite:PUB00037809], [cite:PUB00080755], [cite:PUB00021018]]. CDP-D-Glucose is the precursor for synthesising four of the five naturally occurring 3,6-dideoxy sugars-abequose (3,6-dideoxy-D-Xylo-hexose), ascarylose (3,6-dideoxy-L-arabino-hexose), paratose (3,6-dideoxy-D-ribohexose), and tyvelose (3,6-dideoxy-D-arabino-hexose. Deoxysugars are ubiquitous in nature where they function in a variety of biological processes, including cell adhesion, immune response, determination of ABO blood groups, fertilisation, antibiotic function, and microbial pathogenicity [[cite:PUB00080743]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the probable glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase from Bacillus subtilis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02524" "G1P_cytidylyltransferase catalyzes the production of CDP-D-Glucose"}, "panther" {"PTHR47183" "GLUCOSE-1-PHOSPHATE CYTIDYLYLTRANSFERASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase-like", "short" "G1P_cyt_trans-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2252, "taxa" 10999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8368}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
