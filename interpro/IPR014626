{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of signal transduction response regulators which contain a modified version of the HD-GYP domain as an output domain.</p>\n\n<p>Response regulators of the microbial two-component signal transduction systems typically consist of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver (phosphoacceptor) domain and a C-terminal output (usually DNA-binding) domain. In response to an environmental stimulus, a phosphoryl group is transferred from the His residue of sensor histidine kinase to an Asp residue in the CheY-like receiver domain of the cognate response regulator [[cite:PUB00011096], [cite:PUB00011190], [cite:PUB00007866]]. Phosphorylation of the receiver domain induces conformational changes that activate an associated output domain, which in turn triggers the response. Phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in response regulator molecule have been demonstrated in direct structural studies [[cite:PUB00011157]].</p>\n\n<p>HD-GYP is a conserved domain found in response regulator modules of various signal transduction systems. The involvement of the HD-GYP domain in signal transduction was originally proposed on the basis of its association with CheY-like and other signal transduction domains [[cite:PUB00011196]] and was later directly demonstrated experimentally by showing that RpfG is involved in regulation of the biosynthesis of extracellular endoglucanase and polysaccharide [[cite:PUB00011195]].</p>\n\n<p>A modification of the HD-GYP domain, which is found in this group, [interpro:IPR014408], and several smaller groups, lacks the conserved distal portion of the domain and has certain substitutions in the characteristic metal-binding residues [[cite:PUB00005837]] of the HD superfamily phosphohydrolases, which likely render it catalytically inactive. Note that the prototypical HD domain ([interpro:IPR006674]) is not recognised in many members of this group.</p>\n\n<p>The exact mode of action and targets of the HD-GYP output domain are not known [[cite:PUB00007150]]. HD-GYP proteins are associated to the HD domain superfamily of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases; HD designates the principal conserved residues implicated in metal binding and catalysis [[cite:PUB00005837]]. The HD-GYP version of the HD-type domain has many additional highly conserved residues, including a conserved GYP motif, hence its name [[cite:PUB00011196], [cite:PUB00007150]].</p>\n\n<p>It has been noted that the highly conserved sequence of the HD-GYP domain suggests high substrate specificity [[cite:PUB00007150]]. On the basis of its association with the GGDEF diguanylate cyclase domain, it has been also predicted that the HD-GYP domain may be involved in the metabolism of cyclic diguanylate or in dephosphorylation of some phosphotransfer domain [[cite:PUB00007150]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036883" "Predicted response regulator with modified HD-GYP domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Signal transduction response regulator with modified HD-GYP domain, putative", "short" "Sig_transdc_resp-reg_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 217, "taxa" 1380, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1202, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1200, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 829}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014626", :literature {"PUB00007866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["West AH" "Stock AM."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
