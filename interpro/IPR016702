{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit g (ATP5MG), metazoa type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F1F0 ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F1 - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F0 - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F1 is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. ATP5MG is part of the complex F0 domain [[cite:PUB00090176]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017835" "Mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit g, animal type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit g, animal", "short" "ATP_synth_su_G_mt_met"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 714, "taxa" 3929, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1544, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1543, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 836}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016702", :literature {"PUB00090176" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["Couoh-Cardel SJ" "Uribe-Carvajal S" "Wilkens S" "Garcia-Trejo JJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
