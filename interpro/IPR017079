{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the enzyme zeaxanthin epoxidase ([ec:1.14.13.90]), which is involved in the epoxidation of zeaxanthin as part of the biosynthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA is a sesquiterpenoid (15-carbon) which is partially produced via the mevalonic pathway in chloroplasts and other plastids (therefore its biosynthesis primarily occurs in the leaves). The production of ABA is accentuated by stresses such as water loss and freezing temperatures.</p>\r\n<p>The enzyme zeaxanthin epoxidase converts zeaxanthin into antheraxanthin and subsequently into violaxanthin. This enzyme also acts on beta-cryptoxanthin. Zeaxanthin epoxidase plays an important role in resistance to stresses, seed development and dormancy [[cite:PUB00044633]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036989" "Zeaxanthin epoxidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zeaxanthin epoxidase", "short" "Zeaxanthin_epoxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 210, "taxa" 893, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 553, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 351}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
