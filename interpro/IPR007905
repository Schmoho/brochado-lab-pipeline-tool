{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Emopamil binding protein (EBP) is a nonglycosylated type I integral membrane protein of endoplasmic reticulum and shows high level expression in epithelial tissues. The EBP protein has emopamil binding domains, including the sterol acceptor site and the catalytic centre, which show Delta8-Delta7 sterol isomerase activity. Human sterol isomerase, a homologue of mouse EBP, is suggested not only to play a role in cholesterol biosynthesis, but also to affect lipoprotein internalisation. In humans, mutations of EBP are known to cause the genetic disorder of X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2). This syndrome of humans is lethal in most males, and affected females display asymmetric hyperkeratotic skin and skeletal abnormalities [[cite:PUB00010438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14207" "STEROL ISOMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Emopamil-binding protein", "short" "EBP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1818, "taxa" 5936, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4999, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4999, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3100}, "pathways" 24}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
