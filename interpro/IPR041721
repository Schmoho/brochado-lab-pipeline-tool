{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a lactate binding TRAP transporter TTHA0766 and related proteins [[cite:PUB00052803]].  TRAP transporters are a large family of solute transporters ubiquitously found in bacteria and archaea. They are comprised of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP; often called the P subunit) and two unequally sized integral membrane components: a large transmembrane subunit involved in the translocation process (the M subunit) and a smaller membrane of unknown function (the Q subunit). The driving force of TRAP transporters is provided by electrochemical ion gradients (either protons or sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than ATP hydrolysis. This substrate-binding domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2). The PBP2 proteins are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap [[cite:PUB00056198]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zzv", "name" "Crystal Structure of a Periplasmic Substrate Binding Protein in Complex with Calcium and Lactate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038404", "name" "TRAP transporter solute receptor DctP superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13681" "Substrate-binding component of a lactate binding Tripartite ATP-independent Periplasmic transporter and related proteins; the type 2 periplasmic-binding protein fold"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lactate-binding periplasmic protein TTHA0766", "short" "TTHA0766"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 124, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 106}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041721", :literature {"PUB00052803" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Akiyama N" "Takeda K" "Miki K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
