In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes are separated into two daughter cells. In meiosis II, the sister chromosomes are then separated into newly formed daughter cells. During prophase I, several events occurs: sister chromatid cohesion, homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, crossover formation and chromosome segregation. Homologous recombination is initiated from the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The formation of DSBs is catalyzed by Spo11 and its homologues. So far, six Arabidopsis proteins,  AtSPO11-1, AtSPO11-2, AtPRD1, AtPRD2, AtPRD3 and AtDFO,  have been shown to be involved in DSB formation [[cite:PUB00097637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35768" "PROTEIN MULTIPOLAR SPINDLE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein MULTIPOLAR SPINDLE 1", "short" "Msp1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 230, "taxa" 855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 552, "sets" 0, "proteins" 552, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 340}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037500", :literature {"PUB00097637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tang Y" "Yin Z" "Zeng Y" "Zhang Q" "Chen L" "He Y" "Lu P" "Ye" "Zhang X."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "MTOPVIB interacts with AtPRD1 and plays important roles in formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "10007", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28855712}, "PUB00087068" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Jiang H" "Wang FF" "Wu YT" "Zhou X" "Huang XY" "Zhu J" "Gao JF" "Dong RB" "Cao KM" "Yang ZN."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03929.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "MULTIPOLAR SPINDLE 1 (MPS1), a novel coiled-coil protein of Arabidopsis thaliana, is required for meiotic spindle organization.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1001-10", "volume" "59", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19500302}, "PUB00087069" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["de Oliveira EA" "Romeiro NC" "Ribeiro Eda S" "Santa-Catarina C" "Oliveira AE" "Silveira V" "de Souza Filho GA" "Venancio TM" "Cruz MA."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045707", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Structural and functional characterization of the protein kinase Mps1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e45707", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23049844}, "PUB00087070" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["De Muyt A" "Pereira L" "Vezon D" "Chelysheva L" "Gendrot G" "Chambon A" "Laine-Choinard S" "Pelletier G" "Mercier R" "Nogue F" "Grelon M."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000654", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "A high throughput genetic screen identifies new early meiotic recombination functions in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e1000654", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19763177}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000212", "name" "meiotic spindle organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0042138", "name" "meiotic DNA double-strand break formation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR037500", "name" "Protein MULTIPOLAR SPINDLE 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
