{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes type III secretion system (T3SS) chaperone proteins similar to Salmonella enterica SicP. In S. enterica, many of its serovars being serious human pathogens, the T3SS allows injection of the effector SptP, a virulence protein that is involved in bacterial invasion into a host cell. Chaperone SicP forms a complex with SptP at an early stage of the effector protein secretion process in order to avoid premature degradation; also, the complex is dissociated at a late stage to secrete only SptP with the help of the ATPase InvC which is part of the related T3SS injectisome [[cite:PUB00057254], [cite:PUB00096367], [cite:PUB00014306]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jyo", "name" "Structure of the Salmonella Virulence Effector SptP in Complex with its Secretion Chaperone SicP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17021" "Class IA type III secretion system chaperone protein, similar to Salmonella enterica chaperone protein SicP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperone protein SicP", "short" "SicP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 347, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 463, "sets" 0, "proteins" 463, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 418}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044530", :literature {"PUB00014306" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6859", "authors" ["Stebbins CE" "Galan JE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35102073", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Maintenance of an unfolded polypeptide by a cognate chaperone in bacterial type III secretion.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "77-81", "volume" "414", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11689946}, "PUB00057254" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Fu Y" "Galan JE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
