{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Type I restriction enzyme EcoR124II methylase subunit from Escherichia coli (T1M, also known as M subunit) and similar bacterial proteins. T1M functions in methylation of specific adenine residues, which is required for both restriction and modification activities [[cite:PUB00020851], [cite:PUB00019722], [cite:PUB00019721], [cite:PUB00096663], [cite:PUB00099965]]. Methylation of specific residues prevents the host from digesting its own genome via its restriction enzymes. The M and S subunits together form a methyltransferase that methylates two adenine residues in complementary strands of a bipartite DNA recognition sequence. In the presence of the R subunit, the complex can also act as an endonuclease, binding to the same target sequence but cutting the DNA some distance from this site. Whether the DNA is cut or modified depends on the methylation state of the target sequence: when the target site is unmodified, the DNA is cut; when the target site is hemi-methylated, the complex acts as a maintenance methyltransferase, modifying the DNA so that both strands become methylated.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Type I restriction endonucleases are components of prokaryotic DNA restriction-modification mechanisms that protects the organism against invading foreign DNA. Type I enzymes have three different subunits subunits -M (modification), S (specificity) and R (restriction) -that form multifunctional enzymes with restriction ([ec:3.1.21.3]), methylase ([ec:2.1.1.72]) and ATPase activities [[cite:PUB00035705], [cite:PUB00035706]]. The S subunit is required for both restriction and modification and is responsible for recognition of the DNA sequence specific for the system. The M subunit is necessary for modification, and the R subunit is required for restriction. These enzymes use S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl group donor in the methylation reaction, and have a requirement for ATP. They recognise asymmetric DNA sequences split into two domains of specific sequence, one 3-4 bp long and another 4-5 bp long, separated by a nonspecific spacer 6-8 bp in length. Cleavage occurs a considerable distance from the recognition sites, rarely less than 400 bp away and up to 7000 bp away. Adenosyl residues are methylated, one on each strand of the recognition sequence. These enzymes are widespread in eubacteria and archaea.
