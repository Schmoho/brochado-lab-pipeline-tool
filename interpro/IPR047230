{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of animal proteins related to core components of the circadian clock, including the human proteins circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK), neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (NPAS2) and the circadian clock protein PASD1.</p>\n\n<p>CLOCK and NPAS2 are core clock components. CLOCK is a transcriptional activator that also has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatin remodelling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins, including its own partner BMAL1 [[cite:PUB00064027], [cite:PUB00102299], [cite:PUB00102303]]. NPAS2 mediates the diurnal variation in the expression of GABARA1 receptor in the brain and contributes to the regulation of anxiety-like behaviors and GABAergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum [[cite:PUB00102302], [cite:PUB00102300]].</p>\n\n<p>PASD1 functions as a nuclear repressor of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional activation of the core clock components, acting as a suppressor of the biological clock that drives the daily circadian rhythms of cells throughout the body [[cite:PUB00102301]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vji", "name" "Crystal structure of the CLOCK Transcription Domain Exon19 in Complex with a Repressor"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46055" "CIRCADIAN LOCOMOTER OUTPUT CYCLES PROTEIN KAPUT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput-like", "short" "CLOCK-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 899, "taxa" 3758, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4607, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2866}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
