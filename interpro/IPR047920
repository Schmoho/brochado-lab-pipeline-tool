{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of uncharacterised proteins, predominantly found in proteobacteria, including Zinc metallochaperone GTPase ZigA from Acinetobacter sp. ZigA (Zur-induced GTPase A) is a zinc metallochaperone thought to be important for histidine utilization (HUT), supplying Zn to the histidine ammonia-lyase HutH when required under low-Zn conditions [[cite:PUB00105706]]. Members of this family contain a C-terminal domain that is related to CobW-like, C-terminal domain superfamily [interpro:IPR036627].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038288" "zinc metallochaperone GTPase ZigA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zur-induced GTPase-like", "short" "ZigA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 583, "taxa" 3890, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3615, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3615, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2821}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047920", :literature {"PUB00105706" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Nairn BL" "Lonergan ZR" "Wang J" "Braymer JJ" "Zhang Y" "Calcutt MW" "Lisher JP" "Gilston BA" "Chazin WJ" "de Crecy-Lagard V" "Giedroc DP" "Skaar EP."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "The Response of Acinetobacter baumannii to Zinc Starvation.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "826-36", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27281572}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047920", "name" "Zur-induced GTPase-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
