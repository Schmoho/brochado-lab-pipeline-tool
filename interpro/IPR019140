{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins which are approximately 600 residues in length and contain alternating regions of conservation and low complexity. They are associated components of the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex that acts as a regulator of DNA replication. They bind to the MCM complex during late S phase and promotes the disassembly of the MCM complex from chromatin, thereby acting as a key regulator of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) unloading from replicated DNA. Can dissociate the MCM complex without addition of ATP; probably acts by destabilising interactions of each individual subunits of the MCM complex.
