{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The GDP dissociation inhibitor for rho proteins, rho GDI, regulates GDP/GTP exchange by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from them. The protein contains 204 amino acids, with a calculated Mr value of 23,421. Hydropathy analysis shows it to be largely hydrophilic, with a single hydrophobic region. The protein plays an important role in the activation of the superoxide (O2-)-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. This process requires the interaction of membrane-associated cytochrome b559 with 3 cytosolic components: p47-phox, p67-phox and a heterodimer of the small G-protein p21rac1 and rho GDI [[cite:PUB00001445]]. The association of p21rac and GDI inhibits dissociation of GDP from p21rac, thereby maintaining it in an inactive form. The proteins are attached via a lipid tail on p21rac that binds to the hydrophobic region of GDI [[cite:PUB00003781]]. Dissociation of these proteins might be mediated by the release of lipids (e.g., arachidonate and phosphatidate) from membranes through the action of phospholipases [[cite:PUB00003781]]. The lipids may then compete with the lipid tail on p21rac for the hydrophobic pocket on GDI.</p>\n\n<p>Two homologues of rho GDP-dissociation inhibitors have been identified in Dicytostelium: GDI1 and GDI2. They are cytosolic proteins. GDI1 has been found to play a central role in cytokinesis through the regulation of Rho family GTPases Rac1s and/or RacE [[cite:PUB00101427], [cite:PUB00101430]].</p>\n\n<p>Rho GDI in yeast has been shown to have similar properties as mammalian rho GDI [[cite:PUB00101429]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jhx", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF RHOGDI E155H, E157H MUTANT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014756", "name" "Immunoglobulin E-set", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR024792", "name" "Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02115" "RHO protein GDP dissociation inhibitor"}, "panther" {"PTHR10980" "RHO GDP-DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR"}, "prints" {"PR00492" "RHOGDI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rho protein GDP-dissociation inhibitor", "short" "Rho_GDI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 83, "proteomes" 2514, "taxa" 8437, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7621, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7443, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4886}, "pathways" 55}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000406", :literature {"PUB00001445" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pick E" "Gorzalczany Y" "Engel S."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
