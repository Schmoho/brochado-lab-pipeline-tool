{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>V-ATPases (also known as V1V0-ATPase or vacuolar ATPase) are found in the eukaryotic endomembrane system, and in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes and certain specialised eukaryotic cells. V-ATPases hydrolyse ATP to drive a proton pump, and are involved in a variety of vital intra-and inter-cellular processes such as receptor mediated endocytosis, protein trafficking, active transport of metabolites, homeostasis and neurotransmitter release [[cite:PUB00020609]]. V-ATPases are composed of two linked complexes: the V1 complex (subunits A-H) contains the catalytic core that hydrolyses ATP, while the V0 complex (subunits a, c, c', c'', d) forms the membrane-spanning pore. V-ATPases may have an additional role in membrane fusion through binding to t-SNARE proteins [[cite:PUB00020608]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the V0 complex Ac45 accessory subunit (ATP6AP1, also known as V-type proton ATPase subunit S1), an ER/Golgi membrane protein. This subunit is synthesized as an N-glycosylated 60kDa precursor that is intracellularly cleaved to a protein of about 45kDa. This subunit plays a crucial role on V0 assembly, stability and function as it connects to multiple V0 subunits and phospholipids in the c-ring [[cite:PUB00099348]]. This subunit assists the V-ATPase in the acidification of neuroendocrine granules [[cite:PUB00020640]] and guides the V-ATPase into specialized subcellular compartments such as neuroendocrine regulated secretory vesicles or the ruffled border of the osteoclast [[cite:PUB00098645]]. In humans, mutations of ATP6AP1 cause immunodeficiency with hypogammaglobulinemia, hepatopathy and neurocognitive abnormalities [[cite:PUB00098645]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12471" "VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE SUBUNIT S1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "V0 complex accessory subunit Ac45", "short" "Ac45_acc_su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 988, "taxa" 3920, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3216, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2160}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008388", :literature {"PUB00098645" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Jansen EJ" "Timal S" "Ryan M" "Ashikov A" "van Scherpenzeel M" "Graham LA" "Mandel H" "Hoischen A" "Iancu TC" "Raymond K" "Steenbergen G" "Gilissen C" "Huijben K" "van Bakel NH" "Maeda Y" "Rodenburg RJ" "Adamowicz M" "Crushell E" "Koenen H" "Adams D" "Vodopiutz J" "Greber-Platzer S" "Muller T" "Dueckers G" "Morava E" "Sykut-Cegielska J" "Martens GJ" "Wevers RA" "Niehues T" "Huynen MA" "Veltman JA" "Stevens TH" "Lefeber DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "ATP6AP1 deficiency causes an immunodeficiency with hepatopathy, cognitive impairment and abnormal protein glycosylation.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "11600", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27231034}, "PUB00020609" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wilkens S" "Zhang Z" "Zheng Y."], "ISO_journal" "Micron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2004.10.002", "medline_journal" "Micron", "title" "A structural model of the vacuolar ATPase from transmission electron microscopy.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "109-26", "volume" "36", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15629643}, "PUB00020608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bajjalieh S."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2005.05.002", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A new view of an old pore.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "496-7", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15907459}, "PUB00020640" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Holthuis JC" "Jansen EJ" "Schoonderwoert VT" "Burbach JP" "Martens GJ."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
