{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the enzyme tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase ([ec:2.5.1.34]), which catalyses the first step of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00044675]]. Ergot alkaloids, which are produced by endophyte fungi, can enhance plant host fitness, but also cause livestock toxicosis to host plants. This enzyme is part of a larger group of aromatic prenyltransferases that may act on trp-containing cyclic dipeptides, or on tyrosine or other related substrates. Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase and related enzymes typically are of fungal origin are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as ergot alkaloids [[cite:PUB00042956]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3i4z", "name" "Crystal structure of the dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase FgaPT2 from Aspergillus fumigatus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03430" "tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase", "short" "Trp_dimethylallylTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 76, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 70, "sets" 0, "proteins" 70, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
