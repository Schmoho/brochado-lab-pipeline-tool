{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase eukaryotic ([ec:2.6.1.19]) is a class III pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase. The enzyme catalyses the conversion of 4-aminobutanoate and 2-oxoglutarate into succinate semialdehyde and L-glutamate. The degree of sequence difference between this set and known bacterial examples is greater than the distance between either set the most similar enzyme with distinct function, and so the prokaryotic and eukaryotic sets have been placed into separate families. This family describes known eukaryotic examples of the enzyme. Alternate names include GABA transaminase, gamma-amino-N-butyrate transaminase, and beta-alanine--oxoglutarate aminotransferase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4y0i", "name" "GABA-aminotransferase inactivated by conformationally-restricted inactivator"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00699" "4-aminobutyrate--2-oxoglutarate transaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, eukaryotic", "short" "4NH2But_aminotransferase_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1746, "taxa" 5826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3495, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3494, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2163}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1288", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1288"} {"accession" "GenProp1506", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1506"} {"accession" "GenProp1523", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1523"} {"accession" "GenProp0233", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0233"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
