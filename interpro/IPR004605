{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvB, which as part of a complex with RuvA homologues serve as a 5'-3' Holliday junction helicase. RuvA specifically binds Holliday junctions as a sandwich of two tetramers and maintains the configuration of the junction. It forms a complex with two hexameric rings of RuvB, the subunit that contains helicase activity. The complex drives ATP-dependent branch migration of the Holliday junction recombination intermediate [[cite:PUB00013198]]. The endonuclease RuvC resolves junctions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1in4", "name" "THERMOTOGA MARITIMA RUVB HOLLIDAY JUNCTION BRANCH MIGRATION MOTOR"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42848" "PTHR42848"}, "hamap" {"MF_00016" "Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvB [ruvB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00635" "Holliday junction DNA helicase RuvB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvB", "short" "DNA_helicase_Holl-junc_RuvB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9104, "taxa" 36140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43289, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43268, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33103}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0198", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0198"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
