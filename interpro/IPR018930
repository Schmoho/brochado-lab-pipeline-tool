{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of late embryogenesis-abundant proteins There is high accumulation of this protein in dry seeds, and in the roots of full-grown plants in response to dehydration and ABA (abscisic acid application) treatments [[cite:PUB00044331]]. This LEA protein disappears after germination. It accumulates in growing regions of well irrigated hypocotyls and meristems suggesting a role in seedling growth resumption on rehydration [[cite:PUB00044332]]. As a group the LEA proteins are highly hydrophilic, contain a high percentage of glycine residues, lack Cys and Trp residues and do not coagulate upon exposure to high temperature, and for these reasons are considered to be members of a group of proteins called hydrophilins [[cite:PUB00009713]]. Expression of the protein is negatively regulated during etiolating growth, particularly in roots, in contrast to its expression patterns during normal growth [[cite:PUB00044333]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10714" "Late embryogenesis abundant protein 18"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Late embryogenesis abundant protein, LEA-18", "short" "LEA-18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 196, "taxa" 770, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 512, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 295}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018930", :literature {"PUB00044331" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Colmenero-Flores JM" "Campos F" "Garciarrubio A" "Covarrubias AA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
