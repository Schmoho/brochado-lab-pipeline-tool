{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant RING-H2 finger proteins, including ATL1 and ATL16 from Arabidopsis. They are ubiquitin ligases that contain a RING-H2 domain [[cite:PUB00096516], [cite:PUB00101404]].  ATL1 plays a central role in regulating plant defense responses and programmed cell death [[cite:PUB00096518]]. ATL16 is involved in carbon (C) and nitrogen nutrients (N) regulation and the defense response [[cite:PUB00096516]]. This entry also includes ATL55 that localises to the plasma membrane lipid rafts to trigger the FB1-induced plant programmed cell death pathway [[cite:PUB00096765]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46913" "RING-H2 FINGER PROTEIN ATL16"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RING-H2 finger protein ATL1/ATL16-like", "short" "ATL1/ATL16-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 309, "taxa" 1512, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8841, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8841, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5177}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
