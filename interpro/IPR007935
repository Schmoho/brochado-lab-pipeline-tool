{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several tobravirus 2B proteins. It is known that the 2B protein is required for transmission by both Paratrichodorus pachydermus and Paratrichodorus anemones nematodes [[cite:PUB00010450]]. Transmission of the tobraviruses Tobacco rattle virus by trichodorid vector nematodes requires the viral coat protein (CP) and the 2B protein, a nonstructural protein encoded by RNA2, the smaller of the two viral genomic RNAs. It is hypothesized that the 2B protein functions by interacting with a small, flexible domain located at the C terminus of the CP, forming a bridge between the virus particle and the internal surface of the vector nematode feeding apparatus [[cite:PUB00010451]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05271" "Tobravirus 2B protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tobravirus 2B", "short" "Tobravirus_2B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 20, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007935", :literature {"PUB00010450" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Vassilakos N" "Vellios EK" "Brown EC" "Brown DJ" "MacFarlane SA."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.2000.0677", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Tobravirus 2b protein acts in trans to facilitate transmission by nematodes.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "478-87", "volume" "279", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11162804}, "PUB00010451" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Vellios E" "Duncan G" "Brown D" "MacFarlane S."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.2002.1511", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Immunogold localization of tobravirus 2b nematode transmission helper protein associated with virus particles.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "118-24", "volume" "300", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12202212}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007935", "name" "Tobravirus 2B", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 1}}}
