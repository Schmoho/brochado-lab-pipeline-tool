{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rec1 of Ustilago maydis is a homologue of S. pombe Rad1 and S. cerevisiae Rad17 proteins. It plays a key role in regulating the genetic system of the fungus. Rec1 mutants are very sensitive to UV light - mutation leads to a complex phenotype with alterations in DNA repair, recombination, mutagenesis, meiosis and cell division. The predicted product of the REC1 gene is a polypeptide of 522 amino acid residues with molecular mass 57 kD. The protein shows 3'--5' exonuclease activity, but only in cells over-expressing Rec1. While it is distinguishable from the major bacterial nucleases, the protein has certain enzymatic features in common with epsilon, the proof-reading exonuclease subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00006116]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01247" "RECEXONCLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exonuclease Rec1, Ustilaginaceae", "short" "Rec1_exonuc_Ustilaginaceae"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 75, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
