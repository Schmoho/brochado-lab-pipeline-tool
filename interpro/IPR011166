{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tryptophanase (tryptophan indole-lyase, TNase) ([ec:4.1.99.1]) and tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) ([ec:4.1.99.2]) are related pyridoxal-phosphate dependent homotetrameric enzymes that catalyse the reversible hydrolytic cleavage of L-tryptophan or L-tyrosine to indole or phenol, respectively, and ammonium pyruvate. These two enzymes are very similar in sequence and structure, but show strict substrate specificity. Both TNase and TPL may react by a rare S(E)2-type mechanism [[cite:PUB00014799]]. Collectively, these enzymes are known as the beta-eliminating lyase family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7fjk", "name" "Tyrosine phenol-lyase from pantoea agglomerans"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001386" "Tryptophanase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-eliminating lyase family", "short" "Beta-eliminating_lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 44, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 897, "taxa" 5600, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6212, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6206, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4384}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00667", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00667"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
