{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The E. coli interleukin [IL] receptor mimic protein A (IrmA), is a small (13kDa) Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) protein that was originally identified in a large reverse genetic screen as a broadly protective vaccine antigen. It has a fibronectin III (FNIII)-like fold that forms a domain-swapped dimer with structural mimicry to the binding domain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) and, to a lesser extent, the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R). IrmA binds to all three cytokines, with the greatest affinity observed for IL-4. It is suggested that IrmA may contribute to manipulation of the innate immune response during UPEC infection [[cite:PUB00091248]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF18673" "interleukin receptor mimic protein A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin receptor mimic protein A", "short" "IrmA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 329, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 313, "sets" 0, "proteins" 313, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 212}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040755", :literature {"PUB00091248" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Moriel DG" "Heras B" "Paxman JJ" "Lo AW" "Tan L" "Sullivan MJ" "Dando SJ" "Beatson SA" "Ulett GC" "Schembri MA."], "ISO_journal" "MBio", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02046-15", "medline_journal" "MBio", "title" "Molecular and Structural Characterization of a Novel Escherichia coli Interleukin Receptor Mimic Protein.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e02046", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26980835}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040755", "name" "Interleukin receptor mimic protein A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 27}}}
