{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SYR-related high mobility group (HMG) box (SOX) family proteins are a conserved group of transcriptional regulators defined by the presence of a highly conserved HMG box domain that mediates DNA binding [[cite:PUB00075269]]. This group represents the redundantly acting transcription factor SOX-12/11/4 proteins, which belong to the subgroup C of the SOX gene family. These proteins have almost identical DNA-binding domains that bind to the DNA sequence 5'-AACAAT-3' and have a highly conserved transactivation domain at their C-terminal [[cite:PUB00094701]]. They play an essential role in several developmental pathways including neurogenesis and skeletogenesis, affecting maintenance, proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells in developing tissues such as the neural tube, branchial arches and somites [[cite:PUB00094701], [cite:PUB00063801], [cite:PUB00063802], [cite:PUB00094700]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038098" "SOX-12/11/4a protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor SOX-12/11/4", "short" "SOX-12/11/4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 581, "taxa" 2171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2094, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1828, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1208}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017386", :literature {"PUB00063801" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Hiraoka Y" "Komatsu N" "Sakai Y" "Ogawa M" "Shiozawa M" "Aiso S."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(97)00242-4", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "XLS13A and XLS13B: SRY-related genes of Xenopus laevis.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "65-71", "volume" "197", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9332350}, "PUB00063802" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Hyodo-Miura J" "Urushiyama S" "Nagai S" "Nishita M" "Ueno N" "Shibuya H."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00536.x", "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Involvement of NLK and Sox11 in neural induction in Xenopus development.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "487-96", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12047350}, "PUB00094701" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zawerton A" "Yao B" "Yeager JP" "Pippucci T" "Haseeb A" "Smith JD" "Wischmann L" "Kuhl SJ" "Dean JCS" "Pilz DT" "Holder SE; Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study; University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics" "McNeill A" "Graziano C" "Lefebvre V."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
