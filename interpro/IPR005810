ATP-citrate lyase is a tetramer of identical subunits.</li>\n<li>Succinyl-CoA ligase (GDP-forming) ([ec:6.2.1.4]) [[cite:PUB00005004]] is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the substrate level phosphorylation step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle: the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with a concomitant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and phosphate. This enzyme is a dimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunits.</li>\n<li>Succinyl-CoA ligase (ADP-forming) ([ec:6.2.1.5]) [[cite:PUB00000280]] is a bacterial enzyme that during aerobic metabolism functions in the citric acid cycle, coupling the hydrolysis of succinyl-CoA to the synthesis of ATP. It can also function in the other direction for anabolic purposes. This enzyme is a tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits.</li>\n<li>Malate-CoA ligase ([ec:6.2.1.9]) (malyl-CoA synthetase) [[cite:PUB00002257]], is a bacterial enzyme that forms malyl-CoA from malate and CoA with the concomitant hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate.
