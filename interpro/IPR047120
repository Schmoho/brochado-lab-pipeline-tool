{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins with a LIM-type zinc finger that are found in animals and some fungal species, including Protein prickle (Pk) and Protein espinas (Esn) from Drosophila melanogaster and human Testin (Tes).</p>\n\n<p>Pk has been implicated in regulation of cell movement in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway [[cite:PUB00080188]], which requires the conserved Frizzled/Dishevelled (Dsh). Prickle interacts with Dishevelled [[cite:PUB00080187]], thereby modulating the activity of Frizzled/Dishevelled and the PCP signalling. Two forms of prickle have been identified, namely prickle 1 and prickle 2. These are differentially expressed; prickle 1 is found in fetal heart and haematological malignancies, while prickle 2 is expressed in fetal brain, adult cartilage, pancreatic islet, and some types of tumorous cells [[cite:PUB00080184]].</p>\n\n<p>Esn binds to the seven-pass transmembrane cadherin Flamingo. The interplay elicits repulsion between dendritic branches of sensory neurons [[cite:PUB00101979]].</p>\n\n<p>Tes is a cytoskeleton associated focal adhesion protein that localizes along actin stress fibres, at cell-cell contact areas, and at focal adhesion plaques [[cite:PUB00080201], [cite:PUB00066361]]. It plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation; it may act as a tumour suppressor [[cite:PUB00066359], [cite:PUB00066361]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24211" "LIM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prickle/Espinas/Testin", "short" "Pk/Esn/Tes"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1006, "taxa" 4052, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8048, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8048, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5366}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047120", :literature {"PUB00066361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Coutts AS" "MacKenzie E" "Griffith E" "Black DM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
