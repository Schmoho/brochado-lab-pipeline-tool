{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the Lon-like protease BrxL, including BrxL from Bacillus cereus, which is part of a type 1 BREX system. BREX systems (bacteriophage exclusion) provide immunity against bacteriophage, a system that allows phage adsorption but prevents phage DNA replication, without degradation of the phage DNA [[cite:PUB00093365], [cite:PUB00097935]]. Methylation of bacterial DNA by PglX probably guides self/non-self discrimination. When the brxA-brxB-brxC-pglX and pglZ-brxL operons are transformed into a susceptible B.subtilis strain (BEST7003) they confer resistance to bacteriophages SPbeta, SP16, Zeta, phi3T and SP02 and partial protection to phages SP01 and SP82G (these include lytic and temperate phage).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02653" "protease Lon-related BREX system protein BrxL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lon-like protease BrxL", "short" "BrxL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 305, "taxa" 2559, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1523, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1523, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1199}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013473", :literature {"PUB00097935" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gordeeva J" "Morozova N" "Sierro N" "Isaev A" "Sinkunas T" "Tsvetkova K" "Matlashov M" "Truncaite L" "Morgan RD" "Ivanov NV" "Siksnys V" "Zeng L" "Severinov K."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "BREX system of Escherichia coli distinguishes self from non-self by methylation of a specific DNA site.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "253-265", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30418590}, "PUB00093365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Goldfarb T" "Sberro H" "Weinstock E" "Cohen O" "Doron S" "Charpak-Amikam Y" "Afik S" "Ofir G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "BREX is a novel phage resistance system widespread in microbial genomes.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "169-83", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25452498}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014061", "name" "Lon-like protease BrxL-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR013473", "name" "Lon-like protease BrxL", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
