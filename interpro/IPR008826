{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of selenium binding proteins from eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Human selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) is a methanethiol oxidase (MTO) that converts methanethiol to H2O2, formaldehyde, and H2S [[cite:PUB00088397]]. Bovine SBP56 has been shown to participate in late stages of intra-Golgi protein transport [[cite:PUB00011458]]. The Lotus japonicus homologue of SBP56, LjSBP is thought to have more than one physiological role, and can be implicated in controlling the oxidation/reduction status of target proteins in vesicular Golgi transport [[cite:PUB00011459]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ece", "name" "X-ray structure of hypothetical selenium-binding protein from Sulfolobus tokodaii, ST0059"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23300" "METHANETHIOL OXIDASE"}, "pfam" {"PF05694" "56kDa selenium binding protein (SBP56)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenium-binding protein", "short" "Se-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 69, "proteomes" 1852, "taxa" 8091, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6909, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4852}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
