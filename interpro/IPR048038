{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase (HBPHA) and trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase (CBPHA). HBPHA catalyses HBP to salicyaldehyde and pyruvate. This reaction is part of the degradative pathways for naphthalene and naphthalenesulfonates by bacteria. CBPHA is homologous to HBPHA and catalyses the cleavage of CBP to 2-carboxylbenzaldehyde and pyruvate during the degradation of phenanthrene. They are member of the DHDPS family of Schiff-base-dependent class I aldolases [[cite:PUB00113467], [cite:PUB00113468], [cite:PUB00113469], [cite:PUB00024869], [cite:PUB00021570]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6dao", "name" "NahE WT selenomethionine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00952" "Trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase (HBPHA) and trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase (CBPHA)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HBPHA/CBPHA", "short" "HBPHA/CBPHA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 304, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 167, "sets" 0, "proteins" 167, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 155}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
