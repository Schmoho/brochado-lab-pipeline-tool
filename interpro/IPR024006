{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this Actinobacterial protein family contain the signal peptide domain [interpro:IPR023833], for the variant SipW form of the signal peptidase I family. The remainder of this protein, however, differs from families such as Peptidase_M73 ([interpro:IPR022121]) and YqxM ([interpro:IPR023848]) that share the same signal peptide domain. The two known targets for export by the SipW signal peptidase in Bacillus subtilis act in producing biofilm matrix material, but the function for this Actinobacterial family is not known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04089" "alternate signal-mediated exported protein, RER_14450 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alternate signal-mediated exported protein, actinobacteria", "short" "Alt_signal_exp_actinobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 240, "taxa" 757, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 764, "sets" 0, "proteins" 764, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 624}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024006", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024006", "name" "Alternate signal-mediated exported protein, actinobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
