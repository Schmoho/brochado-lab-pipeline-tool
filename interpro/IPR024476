{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins of unknown function which are found predominantly in the proteobacteria.

This structure shows some resemblance to three-helical bundle folds such as the serum albumin-like fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038194", "name" "DUF3861 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12977" "Domain of Unknown Function with PDB structure (DUF3861)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF3861", "short" "DUF3861"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 235, "taxa" 1509, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1222, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1222, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 971}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024476", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024476", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF3861", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 233}}}
