{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenases (QHNDH) [ec:1.4.99]) are enzymes produced in the periplasmic space of certain Gram-negative bacteria, such as Paracoccus denitrificans and Pseudomonas putida, in response to primary amines, including n-butylamine and benzylamine. QHNDH catalyses the oxidative deamination of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic amines through formation of a Schiff-base intermediate involving one of the quinone O atoms [[cite:PUB00035735]]. Catalysis requires the presence of a novel redox cofactor, cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ). CTQ is derived from the post-translational modification of specific residues, which involves the oxidation of the indole ring of a tryptophan residue to form tryptophylquinone, followed by covalent cross-linking with a cysteine residue [[cite:PUB00022422]]. There is one CTQ per subunit in QHNDH. In addition to CTQ, two haem c cofactors are present in QHNDH that mediate the transfer of the substrate-derived electrons from CTQ to an external electron acceptor, cytochrome c-550 [[cite:PUB00035736], [cite:PUB00035737]].</p>\r\n<p>QHNDH is a heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits. The alpha and beta subunits contain signal peptides necessary for the translocation of QHNDH to the periplasm. The alpha subunit is composed of four domains - domain 1 forming a dihaem cytochrome, and domains 2-4 forming antiparallel β-barrel structures; the beta subunit is a 7-bladed β-propeller that provides part of the active site; and the small, catalytic gamma subunit contains the novel cross-linked CTQ cofactor, in addition to additional thioester cross-links between Cys and Asp/Glu residues that encage CTQ. The gamma subunit assumes a globular secondary structure with two short α-helices having many turns and bends [[cite:PUB00013277]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the QHNDH alpha subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pby", "name" "Structure of the Phenylhydrazine Adduct of the Quinohemoprotein Amine Dehydrogenase from Paracoccus denitrificans at 1.7 A Resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036718", "name" "Quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase alpha subunit, domain 2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03908" "quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase, alpha subunit", "short" "QH-AmDH_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 136, "taxa" 862, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 874, "sets" 0, "proteins" 874, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 654}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0902", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0902"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023887", :literature {"PUB00013277" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Satoh A" "Kim JK" "Miyahara I" "Devreese B" "Vandenberghe I" "Hacisalihoglu A" "Okajima T" "Kuroda S" "Adachi O" "Duine JA" "Van Beeumen J" "Tanizawa K" "Hirotsu K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
