{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains the sigmaK-factor processing regulatory protein BofA (Bypass-of-forespore protein A) (approximately 80 residues long). During sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, transcription is controlled in the developing sporangium by a cascade of sporulation-specific transcription factors (sigma factors). Following engulfment, processing of sigmaK is inhibited by BofA. It has been suggested that this effect is exerted by alteration of the level of the SpoIVFA protein [[cite:PUB00013152]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07441" "SigmaK-factor processing regulatory protein BofA"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02862" "pro-sigmaK processing inhibitor BofA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SigmaK-factor processing regulatory BofA", "short" "BofA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1155, "taxa" 3987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3840, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3840, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2935}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010001", :literature {"PUB00013152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Resnekov O."], "ISO_journal" "J.
