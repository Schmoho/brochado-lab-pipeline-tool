{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are found only in species with evidence of coenzyme F420. All members of this family are believed to act as NADPH-dependent F420 reductase. This entry includes Methanothermobacter marburgensis fno, which catalyses the reduction of NADP+ with F420H2 via hydride transfer, and the reverse reaction, i.e. the reduction of F420 with NADPH [[cite:PUB00076438]]. Another member, AF_0892 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, is essential for both the 5-deazaflavin structure and the presence of an 8-hydroxy group in the substrate [[cite:PUB00037008]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jay", "name" "Structure of Coenzyme F420H2:NADP+ Oxidoreductase (FNO) with its substrates bound"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01915" "NADPH-dependent F420 reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADPH-dependent F420 reductase", "short" "NpdG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1211, "taxa" 4714, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5539, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4235}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0791", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0791"} {"accession" "GenProp0002", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0002"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
