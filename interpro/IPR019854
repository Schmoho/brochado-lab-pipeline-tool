{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides) [[cite:PUB00045354]]. GldC is a protein linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Knockouts of GldC do not abolish the gliding phenotype but do impair it. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species C. johnsonae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19937" "Gliding motility-associated protein GldC-like"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03515" "gliding motility protein GldC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility-associated protein, GldC", "short" "Motility-assoc_prot_GldC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 802, "taxa" 2590, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2831, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2831, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2196}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019854", :literature {"PUB00045354" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Hunnicutt DW" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
