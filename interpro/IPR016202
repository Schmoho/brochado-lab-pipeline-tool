{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents DNaseI and related proteins such as DNase gamma.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) ([ec:3.1.21.1]) [[cite:PUB00003994]] is a vertebrate enzyme which catalyzes the endonucleolytic cleavage of double-stranded DNA to 5'- phosphodinucleotide and 5'-phosphooligonucleotide end-products. DNase I is an enzyme involved in DNA degradation; it is normally secreted outside of the cell but seems to be able to gain access to the nucleus where it is involved in cell death by apoptosis [[cite:PUB00001239]].</p>\n\n<p>As shown in the following schematic representation, DNase I is a glycoprotein of about 260 residues with two conserved disulphide bonds.</p>\n\n<pre>\n                              +-+               +--------+\n                              | |               |        |\n      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx#xxxxxxCxCxxxxx#xxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n                                   \n\n'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulphide bond.\n'#': active site residue.\n</pre>\n\n<p>DNase I has a pH-optimum around 7.5 and requires calcium and magnesium for full activity. It causes single strand nicks in duplex DNA. A proton acceptor-donor chain composed of a histidine and a glutamic acid produce a nucleophilic hydroxyl ion from water, which cleaves the 3'-P-O bond [[cite:PUB00004018]]. DNase I forms a 1:1 complex with G-actin, resulting in the inhibition of DNase activity and loss of the ability of G-actin to polymerise into fibres [[cite:PUB00004077]]. DNase I has been used in the treatment of lung problems in patients with cystic fibrosis: here it acts by degrading DNA found in purulent lung secretions, reducing their viscosity and making it easier for the patient to breathe [[cite:PUB00004719]].</p>\n\n<p>The sequence of DNase I is evolutionary related to that of human muscle-specific DNase-like protein and human proteins DHP1 and DHP2. However, the first disulphide bond of DNase I is not conserved in these proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3w3d", "name" "Crystal structure of smooth muscle G actin DNase I complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036691", "name" "Endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00476" "deoxyribonuclease I"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000988" "Deoxyribonuclease I"}, "prints" {"PR00130" "DNASEI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deoxyribonuclease I", "short" "DNase_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1030, "taxa" 4364, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6304, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6182, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4207}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
