{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Azurin is a blue copper-binding protein in the plastocyanin/azurin family. It serves as a redox partner to enzymes such as nitrite reductase or arsenite oxidase. The most closely related copper-binding proteins to this family are auracyanins, as in Chloroflexus aurantiacus, which have similar redox activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The copper of Azurin is tetrahedrally coordinated by a cysteine, 2 histidines, and a methionine residue [[cite:PUB00082908]]. The electron transfer reactions are carried out with the Cu centre transitioning between the oxidized Cu(II) form and the reduced Cu(I) form. Azurin can function as a tumor suppressor; it forms a complex with p53 that triggers apoptosis in various human cancer cells [[cite:PUB00082904], [cite:PUB00082905], [cite:PUB00082906], [cite:PUB00082907]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3u25", "name" "Crystal structure of P. aeruginoas azurin containing a Tyr-His hydrogen bonded pair"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13922" "Azurin is a redox partner for enzymes such as nitrite reductase or arsenite oxidase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02695" "azurin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Azurin", "short" "Azurin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 132, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 503, "taxa" 2760, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2964, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2964, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2304}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0473", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0473"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014068", :literature {"PUB00082906" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Punj V" "Das Gupta TK" "Chakrabarty AM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
