{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of serum transport proteins are known to be evolutionarily related, including albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, vitamin D-binding protein and afamin [[cite:PUB00003407], [cite:PUB00000582], [cite:PUB00002857]]. Albumin is the main protein of plasma; it binds water, cations (such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>and K<sup>+</sup>), fatty acids, hormones, bilirubin and drugs - its main function is to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. Alphafeto- protein (alpha-fetoglobulin) is a foetal plasma protein that binds various cations, fatty acids and bilirubin. The biological role of afamin (alpha-albumin) has not yet been characterised. Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is an abundant serum glycoprotein secreted by the liver; the protein transports vitamin D sterols, binds to actin, and is found on the surface of B-lymphocytes and subpopulations of T-lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00002430]]. The full length DBP contains 476-amino acids, including a 16-amino acid signal sequence. Sequence analysis reveals 23% similarity to albumin and to alpha-fetoprotein [[cite:PUB00002430]]. DBP contains a characteristic placement of cysteine residues, identical to that in albumin, suggesting a similar folding structure. Albumin and alpha-fetoprotein contain three internally repeated domains [[cite:PUB00002430]]. DBP shows similarity to the first two domains and has a truncated third domain, supporting the view that DBP is a member of the albumin/alpha-fetoprotein multigene family [[cite:PUB00002430]]. Within the sequence, regularly-spaced disulphide bridges generate a 3-domain folding structure, each domain containing ~170 amino acids, with 5 or 6 internal disulphide bonds, as shown schematically below:</p>\n\n<pre>\n                    +---+          +----+                        +-----+\n                    |   |          |    |                        |     |\n xxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxCCxxCxxxxCxxxxxCCxxxCxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxCCxxxxCxxxx\n   |                 |       |     |              |               |\n   +-----------------+       +-----+              +---------------+\n</pre>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR020858", "name" "Serum albumin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00804" "VITAMNDBNDNG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vitamin D-binding protein", "short" "VitD-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 507, "taxa" 1657, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5809, "sets" 0, "proteins" 732, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 519}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000213", :literature {"PUB00003407" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Haefliger DN" "Moskaitis JE" "Schoenberg DR" "Wahli W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
