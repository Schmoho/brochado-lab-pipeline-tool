{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A cysteine-rich domain of approximately forty five amino-acid residues has been found in some extracellular eukaryotic proteins [[cite:PUB00001033], [cite:PUB00001707], [cite:PUB00005012], [cite:PUB00005400]]. It is known as either the 'P', 'trefoil' or 'TFF' domain, and contains six cysteines linked by three disulphide bonds with connectivity 1-5, 2-4, 3-6. This leads to a characteristic three leafed structure ('trefoil'). The P-type domain is clearly composed of three looplike regions. The central core of the domain consists of a short two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, which is capped by an irregular loop and forms a central hairpin (loop 3). The β-sheet is preceded by a short α-helix, with majority of the remainder of the domain contained in two loops, which lie on either side of the central hairpin.</p>\n\n<p>This domain has been found in a variety of extracellular eukaryotic proteins [[cite:PUB00001033], [cite:PUB00005012], [cite:PUB00005400]], including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Protein pS2 (TFF1), a protein secreted by the stomach mucosa</li>\n<li>Spasmolytic polypeptide (SP) (TFF2), a protein of about 115 residues that inhibits gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion</li>\n<li>Intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) (TFF3)</li>\n<li>Xenopus laevis stomach proteins xP1 and xP4</li>\n<li>Xenopus integumentary mucins A.1 (FIM-A.1 or preprospasmolysin) and C.1 (FIM-C.1), proteins which may be involved in defence against microbial infections by protecting the epithelia from the external environment</li>\n<li>Xenopus skin protein xp2 (or APEG)</li>\n<li>Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein B (ZP-B)</li>\n<li>Intestinal sucrase-isomaltase ([ec:3.2.1.48] / [ec:3.2.1.10]), a vertebrate membrane bound, multifunctional enzyme complex which hydrolyses sucrose, maltose and isomaltose</li>\n<li>Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase ([ec:3.2.1.20])</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2psp", "name" "Porcine pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044913", "name" "P-type trefoil domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13826" "INTESTINAL TREFOIL FACTOR-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR00680" "PTREFOIL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "P-type trefoil, chordata", "short" "P_trefoil_chordata"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 559, "taxa" 1945, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1880, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1377, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 892}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017994", :literature {"PUB00001033" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Otto B" "Wright N."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
