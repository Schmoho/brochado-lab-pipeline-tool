{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Protein E2 from Vaccinia virus, also known as Protein OPG064, and similar sequences from poxvirus. E2 plays a role in intracellular enveloped virus (IEV) transport to the cell surface on microtubules. Together with protein OPG056/F12, it forms a complex that interacts with host KLC2 (kinesin light chain isoform 2) to engage the kinesin-1 complex and thereby promote IEV traffic [[cite:PUB00103568], [cite:PUB00103612]].  E2 shows two domains: an N-terminal annular (ring) domain and a C-terminal globular (head) domain [[cite:PUB00103613]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015692" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, VAC_E2L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus E2", "short" "Poxvirus_E2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 210, "sets" 0, "proteins" 197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007585", :literature {"PUB00103612" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Carpentier DC" "Gao WN" "Ewles H" "Morgan GW" "Smith GL."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Vaccinia virus protein complex F12/E2 interacts with kinesin light chain isoform 2 to engage the kinesin-1 motor complex.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e1004723", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25760349}, "PUB00103613" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gao WND" "Gao C" "Deane JE" "Carpentier DCJ" "Smith GL" "Graham SC."], "ISO_journal" "J Gen Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Gen Virol", "title" "The crystal structure of vaccinia virus protein E2 and perspectives on the prediction of novel viral protein folds.
