{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several avian apovitellenin I sequences. As part of the avian reproductive effort, large quantities of triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles are transported by receptor-mediated endocytosis into the female germ cells. Although the oocytes are surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells harbouring high levels of active lipoprotein lipase, non-lipolysed VLDL is transported into the yolk. This is because VLDL particles from laying chickens (Gallus gallus) are protected from lipolysis by apolipoprotein (apo)-VLDL-II, a potent dimeric lipoprotein lipase inhibitor [[cite:PUB00011251]]. Apo-VLDL-II is produced in the liver and secreted into the blood stream when induced by estrogen production in female birds.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002369" "Apovitellenin I"}, "pfam" {"PF05418" "Apovitellenin I (Apo-VLDL-II)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apovitellenin I", "short" "Apo-VLDL-II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 374, "taxa" 1131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 414, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 342}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008404", :literature {"PUB00011251" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["MacLachlan I" "Steyrer E" "Hermetter A" "Nimpf J" "Schneider WJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
