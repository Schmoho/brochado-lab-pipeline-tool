{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family (previously known as DUF5309) represents the bacteriophage SU10 major capsid protein and related proteins found in phages and bacteriophages. The capsid of SU10 is organised in fivefold symmetry and build from 715 copies of major capsid protein [[cite:PUB00153713]]. The major capsid protein of SU10 adopts an HK97 fold, which is common among tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses [[cite:PUB00153713]]. This protein forms capsomers of two types: pentamers and hexamers.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17236" "SU10 major capsid protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SU10 major capsid protein", "short" "SU10_MCP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 369, "taxa" 2936, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2548, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1513}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035198", :literature {"PUB00153713" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Siborova M" "Fuzik T" "Prochazkova M" "Novacek J" "Benesik M" "Nilsson AS" "Plevka P."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33305-w", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Tail proteins of phage SU10 reorganize into the nozzle for genome delivery.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "5622", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36153309}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035198", "name" "SU10 major capsid protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 234, "alignment:full" 410}}}
