{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Propionate is the second most abundant low molecular mass carbon source found in soil, being generated by the degradation of several amino acids, fementation of crabohydrates and the oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids. Many different organisms are capable of metabolising propionate and several distinct pathways for utilising this compound exist, all of which begin with its activation to propionyl-CoA [[cite:PUB00033216]]. Many bacteria metabolise propionate to pyruvate by the 2-methylcitric acid cycle. In the first step, catalysed by methycitrate synthase, oxaloacetate and propionyl-CoA are condensed to form 2-methylcitrate and CoA. The 2-methylcitrate is subsequently converted to 2-methylisocitrate by the combined actions of a dehydratase and an aconitase. In the final step, 2-methylisocitrate lyase cleaves a C-C bond within this compound to form succinate and pyruvate. The succinate is further oxidised to oxaloacetate which re-enters the cycle, while the pyruvate can be used further for either energy generation or biomass synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this entry are mostly 2-methylisocitrate lyases. Some of them have been annotated (incorrectly it seems) as the related protein carboxyphosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase, which is involved in synthesizing the antibiotic bialaphos in Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Structural studies indicate that these enzymes belong to the isocitrate lyase family, binding a Mg(2+) cofactor and forming a TIM barrel fold [[cite:PUB00027466], [cite:PUB00022299]]. As with other enzymes in this family, substrate-binding induces a conformational change that prevents solvent access to the active site and which is important for catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1xg4", "name" "Crystal Structure of the C123S 2-Methylisocitrate Lyase Mutant from Escherichia coli in complex with the inhibitor isocitrate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015813", "name" "Pyruvate/Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR040442", "name" "Pyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02317" "methylisocitrate lyase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01939" "2-methylisocitrate lyase [prpB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-methylisocitrate lyase", "short" "PrpB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2168, "taxa" 9773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10001, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10001, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7847}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0240", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0240"} {"accession" "GenProp1687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1687"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
