{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tektins are cytoskeletal proteins. They have been demonstrated in such cellular sites as centrioles, basal bodies, and along ciliary and flagellar doublet microtubules. Tektins form unique protofilaments, organised as longitudinal polymers of tektin heterodimers with axial periodicity matching tubulin. Tektin polypeptides consist of several alpha-helical regions that are  predicted to form coiled coils. Indeed, tektins share considerable structural similarities with intermediate filament proteins. Possible functional roles for tektins are: stabilisation of tubulin protofilaments; attachment of A and B-tubules in ciliary/flagellar microtubule doublets and C-tubules in centrioles; binding of axonemal components [[cite:PUB00003360]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Tektin-like protein 1 (TEKTL1) that shares many structural features with tektins, including the overall helix-turn-helix fold and head-to-tail association into filaments, but does not seem to assemble into the large oligomeric bundles associated with tektins. Thus, the mechanism by which TEKTL1 and tektins assemble into filaments differs slightly. In both sea urchin and bovine sperm, TEKTL1 binds to the outer inter-protofilament cleft of A11/A12, where it may help stabilise the outer junction [[cite:PUB00151496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03148" "Tektin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tektin-like", "short" "Tektin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 117, "proteomes" 978, "taxa" 4667, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8748, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8272, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5501}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048256", :literature {"PUB00151496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Leung MR" "Zeng J" "Wang X" "Roelofs MC" "Huang W" "Zenezini Chiozzi R" "Hevler JF" "Heck AJR" "Dutcher SK" "Brown A" "Zhang R" "Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.05.026", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural specializations of the sperm tail.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2880-2896.e17", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37327785}, "PUB00003360" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Norrander JM" "Perrone CA" "Amos LA" "Linck RW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
