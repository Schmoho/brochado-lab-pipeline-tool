{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of unknown function found in phage proteins, typically 120-130 amino acids in length. Some members contain a C-terminal region enriched in basic residues that is predicted to be disordered. The N-terminal of the proteins contain a small globular domain. These proteins are found in the Ackermannviridae family of phages that infect Enterobacteria such as Salmonella, Escherichia, Shigella, and Dickeya.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23877" "Family of unknown function (DUF7231)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7231", "short" "DUF7231"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 136, "sets" 0, "proteins" 131, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055655", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055655", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7231", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 17}}}
