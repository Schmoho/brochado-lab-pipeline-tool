{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including At5g43822 from Arabidopsis. Their function is not clear. In Arabidopsis At5g43822 has been characterised as an essential protein renamed OPENER (OPNR), whose gene is expressed in rapidly dividing cells and may function in cell cycle progression. It is expressed in mitochondria and the nuclear envelope. Loss of function results in embryo lethality and reduced transmission through the female [[cite:PUB00101099]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37904" "OS10G0566900 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "OPENER-like", "short" "OPRN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 244, "taxa" 973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 660, "sets" 0, "proteins" 660, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 417}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038985", :literature {"PUB00101099" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wang W" "Zhang X" "Niittyla T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "OPENER Is a Nuclear Envelope and Mitochondria Localized Protein Required for Cell Cycle Progression in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1446-1465", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31023726}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029159", "name" "Ribosome biogenesis protein C1orf109-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR038985", "name" "OPENER-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
