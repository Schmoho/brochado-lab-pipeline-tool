{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phospholipase C gamma (PLCg), also known as 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase gamma, is a member of the family of phosphoinositide specific PLCs that convert phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into second messengers 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), thereby initiating and propagating numerous cellular signaling events [[cite:PUB00068261]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two forms of phospholipase C-gamma, PLCg1 and PLCg2. PLCg1 is widely distributed but the expression of PLCg2 is primarily limited to cells of haematopoietic lineage [[cite:PUB00068260]]. PLCg1 is critical in many cells, and in haematopoietic systems it is required for T cell and NK cell function, whereas PLCg2 is important in mast cells, NK cells, B cells, and platelets.  A third form, plc-3, is known from Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00082318]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7z3j", "name" "Structure of crystallisable rat Phospholipase C gamma 1 in complex with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017946", "name" "PLC-like phosphodiesterase, TIM beta/alpha-barrel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000952" "1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase gamma"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase gamma", "short" "PLC-gamma"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 740, "taxa" 2906, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3378, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2784, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1270}, "pathways" 95}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
