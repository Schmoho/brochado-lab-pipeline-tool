{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents L-lysine 4-chlorinase BesD, L-lysine 5-chlorinase HalB, ornithine halogenase HalD and related proteins [[cite:PUB00155641]]. BesD is involved in the biosynthesis of terminal alkyne-containing amino acids such as L-propargylglycine (Pra) and L-beta-ethynylserine, that are produced as antibiotics by S.cattleya [[cite:PUB00093050]]. It catalyses the chlorination of L-lysine at the C4 position, leading to the production of 4-chloro-L-lysine. In addition to ornithine, HalD chlorinates lysine but with slower rate. This preference of HalD for ornithine is due to a narrower active site pocket. These enzymes are structurally very similar and adopt a typical cupin-like fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7u6j", "name" "HalB with lysine and succinate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23169" "Halogenase D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-lysine 4-chlorinase BesD/L-lysine 5-chlorinase HalB-like", "short" "BesD/HalB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 535, "taxa" 2672, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2884, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2884, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2147}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
