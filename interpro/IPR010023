{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is a part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases, mainly from beta, gamma and epsilon proteobacteria, Aquifex, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas and Methanosarcina.  All characterised members of the HAD-superfamily hydrolase, subfamily IIIA and most characterised members of the HAD superfamily are phosphatases.  HAD superfamily phosphatases contain active site residues in several conserved catalytic motifs [[cite:PUB00003337]], all of which are found conserved in this family.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria consist of a heteropolysaccharide component (O-antigen) and a hydrophobic component (lipid A). Linking the two portions is 3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO), an 8-carbon sugar. Biosynthesis of KDO linked to lipid A proceeds via five steps, one of which involves removal of a phosphate from KDO 8-P via the action of KDO 8-P phosphatase ([ec:3.1.3.45]) [[cite:PUB00028127]]. This entry includes two homologues with divergent functions: 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphohydrolase (KDO8P phosphatase, KDO8PP, KdsC) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-9-O-phosphonononic acid phosphohydrolase (KDN9P phosphatase, KDN9PP). KDO8PP and KDN9PP catalyze the final step in the synthesis of KDO and the 9-carbon derivative KDN, respectively [[cite:PUB00088395], [cite:PUB00051616]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One member of this family, the YrbI protein from Haemophilus influenzae has been cloned, expressed, purified and found to be an active phosphatase.  Furthermore, its crystal structure has been determined [[cite:PUB00015003]]. The sequence from  Methanosarcina acetivorans, [swissprot:Q8TJL6], is distinctive in that it is linked to an N-terminal cytidylyltransferase domain ([interpro:IPR003329]) and is annotated as acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3e8m", "name" "Structure-function Analysis of 2-Keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononate-9-phosphate (KDN) Phosphatase Defines a New Clad Within the Type C0 HAD Subfamily"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01138" "C1.6.2: Deoxy-d-mannose-octulosonate 8-phosphate Phosphatase Like"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006118" "3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphatase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01670" "3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate phosphatase, YrbI family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "KdsC family", "short" "KdsC_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3953, "taxa" 17303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20665, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20661, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15758}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0204", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0204"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
