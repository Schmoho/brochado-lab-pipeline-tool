{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes N-acetylmuramate/N-acetylglucosamine kinase AmgK from Neisseriales, a sugar kinase that catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of N-acetylmuramate (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at its C1 hydroxyl group, leading to MurNAc alpha-1P and GlcNAc alpha-1P, respectively. It may be involved in peptidoglycan recycling as part of a cell wall recycling pathway that bypasses de novo biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-MurNAc [[cite:PUB00154740]]. AmgK is able to complement the fosfomycin sensitivity phenotype of a P.putida mutant lacking amgK [[cite:PUB00154740]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045759" "N-acetylmuramate/N-acetylglucosamine kinase AmgK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylmuramate/N-acetylglucosamine kinase", "short" "AmgK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 188, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 164, "sets" 0, "proteins" 164, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 121}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
