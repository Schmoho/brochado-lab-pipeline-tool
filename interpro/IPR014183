{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Class III alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH3) ([ec:1.1.1.1]) tend to show poor activity for ethanol among their various substrate alcohols.  They catalyze the oxidation and reduction of a wide variety of substrates that include S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione (HMGSH), S-nitrosoglutathione, and long chain primary alcohols and aldehydes [[cite:PUB00080657]]. The enzyme was previously designated as glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, as it acts as a HMGSH dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.284]). ADH3 oxidizes HMGSH to S-formylglutathione, which is then hydrolyzed to glutathione and formate by a hydrolase [[cite:PUB00080658], [cite:PUB00080659]]. S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione can form spontaneously from formaldehyde and glutathione, and constitutes a cellular strategy for sequestering and metabolizing highly toxic formaldehyde [[cite:PUB00027294]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2fzw", "name" "Structure of the binary complex of the E67L mutant of human glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase with NAD(H)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08300" "class III alcohol dehydrogenases"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02818" "S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase/class III alcohol dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alcohol dehydrogenase class III", "short" "ADH_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5245, "taxa" 19935, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17488, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17488, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13149}, "pathways" 183}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1655", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1655"} {"accession" "GenProp1292", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1292"} {"accession" "GenProp1467", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1467"} {"accession" "GenProp1334", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1334"} {"accession" "GenProp0562", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0562"} {"accession" "GenProp1698", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1698"} {"accession" "GenProp1328", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1328"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
