{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian selenoprotein S (SelS) sequences. SelS is a plasma membrane protein and is present in a variety of tissues and cell types. These proteins are involved in the degradation process of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins which participate in the transfer of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol, where they are destroyed by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00015116]]. They probably serve as a linker between DER1, which mediates the retro-translocation of misfolded proteins into the cytosol, and the ATPase complex VCP, which mediates the translocation and ubiquitination.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q2f", "name" "Structure of the human Selenoprotein S (VCP-interacting membrane protein)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28621" "SELENOPROTEIN S"}, "pfam" {"PF06936" "Selenoprotein S (SelS)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenoprotein S", "short" "Selenoprotein_S"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 800, "taxa" 3264, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1252, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1230, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 818}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009703", :literature {"PUB00015116" {"URL" nil, "issue" "26", "authors" ["Strausberg RL" "Feingold EA" "Grouse LH" "Derge JG" "Klausner RD" "Collins FS" "Wagner L" "Shenmen CM" "Schuler GD" "Altschul SF" "Zeeberg B" "Buetow KH" "Schaefer CF" "Bhat NK" "Hopkins RF" "Jordan H" "Moore T" "Max SI" "Wang J" "Hsieh F" "Diatchenko L" "Marusina K" "Farmer AA" "Rubin GM" "Hong L" "Stapleton M" "Soares MB" "Bonaldo MF" "Casavant TL" "Scheetz TE" "Brownstein MJ" "Usdin TB" "Toshiyuki S" "Carninci P" "Prange C" "Raha SS" "Loquellano NA" "Peters GJ" "Abramson RD" "Mullahy SJ" "Bosak SA" "McEwan PJ" "McKernan KJ" "Malek JA" "Gunaratne PH" "Richards S" "Worley KC" "Hale S" "Garcia AM" "Gay LJ" "Hulyk SW" "Villalon DK" "Muzny DM" "Sodergren EJ" "Lu X" "Gibbs RA" "Fahey J" "Helton E" "Ketteman M" "Madan A" "Rodrigues S" "Sanchez A" "Whiting M" "Madan A" "Young AC" "Shevchenko Y" "Bouffard GG" "Blakesley RW" "Touchman JW" "Green ED" "Dickson MC" "Rodriguez AC" "Grimwood J" "Schmutz J" "Myers RM" "Butterfield YS" "Krzywinski MI" "Skalska U" "Smailus DE" "Schnerch A" "Schein JE" "Jones SJ" "Marra MA; Mammalian Gene Collection Program Team."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
