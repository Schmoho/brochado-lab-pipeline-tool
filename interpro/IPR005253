{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein is predicted to have 10 transmembrane regions. Members of this family are found so far in the Archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Pyrococcus horikoshii) and in a bacterial thermophile, Thermotoga maritima. In Pyrococcus, the gene is located between nadA and nadB, two components of an enzyme involved in de novo synthesis of NAD. By PSI-BLAST, this family shows similarity (but not necessarily homology) to gluconate permease and other transport proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00529" "TIGR00529 family membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP00529", "short" "CHP00529"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 85, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62, "sets" 0, "proteins" 62, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005253", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007294", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF401", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005253", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP00529", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
