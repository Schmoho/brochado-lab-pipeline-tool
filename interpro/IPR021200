{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small clade that correlates (by both gene clustering and phyletic pattern) to the three gene system that includes [interpro:IPR017541], [interpro:IPR017542] and [interpro:IPR017543] found in several Gram-positive bacteria, where [interpro:IPR017541] (XrtG) is distantly related to exosortases. Both this narrow clade, and the larger set of full-length homologous integral membrane proteins, have an especially well-conserved region near the C-terminal with an invariant tyrosine. This homology suggests glycosyltransferase activity [[cite:PUB00060405]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03766" "TIGR03766 family XrtG-associated glycosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical integral membrane protein", "short" "CHIM_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 24, "taxa" 145, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 113, "sets" 0, "proteins" 113, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 93}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0669", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0669"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021200", :literature {"PUB00060405" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Payne SH" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
