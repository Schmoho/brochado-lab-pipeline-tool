{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SurE is one of the several proteins that is expressed when bacterial cells are subjected to environmental stresses and in the stationary growth phase of bacteria [[cite:PUB00071516], [cite:PUB00015315]]. In E. coli, surE is next to pcm, an L-isoaspartyl protein repair methyltransferase that is also required for stationary phase survival. It was originally predicted to be an acid phosphatase, however, subsequent work showed this is not the case [[cite:PUB00034504]]. SurE has been shown to possess phosphatase activity and appears to be specific to nucleoside monophosphates [[cite:PUB00017354]]. In E. coli, Thermotoga maritima, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum  SurE acts strictly on nucleoside 5'- and 3'-monophosphates.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wqk", "name" "Crystal Structure of Sure Protein from Aquifex aeolicus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036523", "name" "SurE-like phosphatase/nucleotidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30457" "5'-NUCLEOTIDASE SURE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00060" "5'/3'-nucleotidase SurE [surE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Survival protein SurE", "short" "SurE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6853, "taxa" 27768, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35297, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35292, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26489}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
