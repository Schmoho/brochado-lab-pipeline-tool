{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOGS 1 and 2 (SHH1 and SHH2) from plants. In Arabidopsis, SHH1 is a homeodomain protein required for DNA methylation and for the accumulation of siRNAs at specific loci [[cite:PUB00089390]]. It interacts with Pol-IV and acts upstream in the RdDM (RNA-directed DNA methylation) pathway. Its SAWADEE domain is a chromatin-binding module that functions as a dual lysine reader, probing for both unmethylated K4 and methylated K9 modifications on the histone 3 (H3) tail [[cite:PUB00067066]]. The function of SHH2 is not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4iup", "name" "crystal structure of Se-substituted arabidopsis thaliana SHH1 SAWADEE domain L200M/L218M mutant"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33827" "PROTEIN SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1/2", "short" "SHH1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 250, "taxa" 970, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2080, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2080, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1282}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039276", :literature {"PUB00089390" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Law JA" "Vashisht AA" "Wohlschlegel JA" "Jacobsen SE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002195", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "SHH1, a homeodomain protein required for DNA methylation, as well as RDR2, RDM4, and chromatin remodeling factors, associate with RNA polymerase IV.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e1002195", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21811420}, "PUB00067066" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Law JA" "Du J" "Hale CJ" "Feng S" "Krajewski K" "Palanca AM" "Strahl BD" "Patel DJ" "Jacobsen SE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Polymerase IV occupancy at RNA-directed DNA methylation sites requires SHH1.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23636332}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039276", "name" "Protein SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
