{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Holliday junction resolvases (hjc gene) and related proteins, primarily from archaeal species [[cite:PUB00007198]]. The Holliday junction is an essential intermediate of homologous recombination. Holliday junctions are four-stranded DNA complexes that are formed during recombination and related DNA repair events. In the presence of divalent cations, these junctions exist predominantly as the stacked-X form in which the double-helical segments are coaxially stacked and twisted by 60 degrees in a right-handed direction across the junction cross-over. In this structure, the stacked arms resemble two adjacent double-helices, but are linked at the junction by two common strands that cross-over between the duplexes [[cite:PUB00007199]]. During homologous recombination, genetic information is physically exchanged between parental DNAs via crossing single strands of the same polarity within the four-way Holliday structure. This process is terminated by the endonucleolytic activity of resolvases, which convert the four-way DNA back to two double strands.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gef", "name" "Crystal structure of the archaeal holliday junction resolvase HJC"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011335", "name" "Restriction endonuclease type II-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011856", "name" "tRNA endonuclease-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01870" "Archaeal holliday junction resolvase (hjc)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holliday junction resolvase Hjc", "short" "Hjc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 354, "taxa" 2666, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3131, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2467}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
