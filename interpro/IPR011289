{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolases reversibly cleave FBP to two triose phosphates, glycerone phophate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. They play a key role in both glycolysis (FBP cleavage) and gluconeogenesis (FBP synthesis). These enzymes can be divide into two classes based on their mode of catalysis. Class I FBP aldolases form a Schiff-base intermediate between glycerone phophate and an active site lysine residue, while the class II enzymes use a divalent cation such as Zn(2+) for catalysis [[cite:PUB00005383]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents class II FBP aldolases found in Gram-positive bacteria, a variety of Gram-negative baceria, and amitochondriate protists.
