{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the beta-phosphoglucomutase (Beta-PGM) enzyme which catalyses the interconversion of beta-D-glucose-1-phosphate and beta-D-glucose-6-phosphate. The 6-phosphate is capable of non-enzymatic anomerisation (alpha to beta or vice versa) while the 1-phosphate is not. A separate enzyme is responsible for the isomerisation of the alpha anomers. Beta-D-glucose-1-phosphate results from the phosphorolysis of maltose ([ec:2.4.1.8]), trehalose ([ec:2.4.1.64]) or trehalose-6-phosphate ([ec:2.4.1.216]). Alternatively, these reactions can be run in the synthetic direction to create the disaccharides. All sequenced genomes which contain a member of this family also appear to contain at least one putative maltose or trehalose phosphorylase. Three species, Lactococcus, Enterococcus and Neisseria appear to contain a pair of paralogous beta-PGM's.</p>\n\n<p>Beta-PGM is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of hydrolase enzymes. These enzymes are characterised by a series of three catalytic motifs positioned within an α-β (Rossman) fold [[cite:PUB00003337]]. Beta-PGM contains an inserted α helical domain in between the first and second conserved motifs and thus is a member of subfamily IA of the superfamily [[cite:PUB00009589], [cite:PUB00009540]]. The third catalytic motif comes in three variants, the third of which, containing a conserved DD or ED, is the only one found here as well as in several other related enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ok2", "name" "Structure of the D10N mutant of beta-phosphoglucomutase from Lactococcus lactis inhibited with glucose 6-phosphate and tetrafluoroaluminate to 1.1A resolution."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01990" "beta-phosphoglucomutase"}, "cdd" {"cd02598" "beta-phosphoglucomutase, similar to Lactococcus lactis beta-phosphoglucomutase (beta-PGM)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-phosphoglucomutase", "short" "Beta-PGM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 60, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1395, "taxa" 5780, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5727, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5727, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4427}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
