{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains many uncharacterized prokaryotic polysaccharide deacetylases (DCAs) that show high sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of bacterial PuuE allantoinases and Helicobacter pylori peptidoglycan deacetylase (HpPgdA) [[cite:PUB00051042], [cite:PUB00058910]]. PuuE allantoinase appears to be metal-independent and specifically catalyses the hydrolysis of (S)-allantoin into allantoic acid. Different from PuuE allantoinase, HpPgdA has the ability to bind a metal ion at the active site and is responsible for a peptidoglycan modification that counteracts the host immune response. Both PuuE allantoinase and HpPgdA function as homotetramers. The monomer is composed of a 7-stranded barrel with detectable sequence similarity to the 6-stranded barrel NodB homology domain of DCA-like proteins in the CE4 superfamily, which removes N-linked or O-linked acetyl groups from cell wall polysaccharides. In contrast to typical NodB-like DCAs, PuuE allantoinase and HpPgdA do not exhibit a solvent-accessible polysaccharide binding groove and might only bind a small molecule at the active site [[cite:PUB00051042], [cite:PUB00058910], [cite:PUB00098336]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10941" "Putative catalytic domain of uncharacterized prokaryotic polysaccharide deacetylases similar to bacterial PuuE allantoinases and Helicobacter pylori peptidoglycan deacetylase (HpPgdA)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterized prokaryotic polysaccharide deacetylases PuuE/HpPgdA-like", "short" "CE4_PuuE_HpPgdA-like_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1111, "taxa" 4922, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4984, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3892}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045235", :literature {"PUB00051042" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Ramazzina I" "Cendron L" "Folli C" "Berni R" "Monteverdi D" "Zanotti G" "Percudani R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
