{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins from the MmgE/PrpD family, which includes 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (PrpD; [ec:4.2.1.79]). PrpD is required for propionate catabolism, catalysing the third step of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle [[cite:PUB00017752]]. This enzyme consists of two domains: a large domain with an all-helical fold and a smaller domain that folds into an α+β domain [[cite:PUB00036075]]. Cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (CAD) shares high identity with proteins of the MmgE/PrpD family. CAD is essential for itaconic acid production in Aspergillus terreus [[cite:PUB00075343]]. Citrate/2-methylcitrate dehydratase from Bacillus subtilis is involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and methylcitric acid cycles as it has both 2-methylcitrate dehydratase and citrate dehydratase activities [[cite:PUB00090961]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5mux", "name" "Crystal structure of 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (MmgE) from Bacillus subtilis."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042183", "name" "MmgE/PrpD superfamily, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042188", "name" "MmgE/PrpD superfamily, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036148", "name" "MmgE/PrpD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16943" "2-METHYLCITRATE DEHYDRATASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MmgE/PrpD", "short" "MmgE_PrpD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4903, "taxa" 19087, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34852, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34852, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25974}, "pathways" 91}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1687"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
