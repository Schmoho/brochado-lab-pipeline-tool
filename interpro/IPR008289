The multifunctional gene is regulated in response to amino acid limitation by coordinate regulation, which provides an economical means of simultaneously synthesizing five shikimate pathway enzymes [[cite:PUB00011136]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03143" "Pentafunctional AROM polypeptide [aroM]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000514" "Pentafunctional AroM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pentafunctional AroM protein", "short" "Pentafunct_AroM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1144, "taxa" 3147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1672, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1654, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 65}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
