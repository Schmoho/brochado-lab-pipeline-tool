{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of membrane transport proteins found in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Most characterised members of this family are the PIN components of auxin efflux systems from plants [[cite:PUB00151519]]. These carriers are saturable, auxin-specific, and localized to the basal ends of auxin transport-competent cells [[cite:PUB00033872], [cite:PUB00033873]]. Plants typically possess several of these proteins, each displaying a unique tissue-specific expression pattern. They are expressed in almost all plant tissues including vascular tissues and roots, and influence many processes including the establishment of embryonic polarity, plant growth, apical hook formation in seedlings and the photo- and gravitropic responses. These plant proteins are typically 600-700 amino acyl residues long and exhibit 8-12 transmembrane segments. This entry also covers the transmembrane region of GPR1155 from human, a cholesterol-binding protein that acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00151524]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03547" "Membrane transport protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane transport PIN-like", "short" "Mem_transp_PIN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 237, "proteomes" 8602, "taxa" 33470, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 73432, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61765, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44383}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004776", :literature {"PUB00033872" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Blakeslee JJ" "Peer WA" "Murphy AS."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
