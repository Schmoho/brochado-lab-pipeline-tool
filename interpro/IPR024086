{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The entry represents a group of phosphoglucosamine mutases (encoded by gene GlmM) from archea and bacteria. MMP1680 protein from Methanococcus maripaludis in this family has been characterised as the archaeal protein responsible for the second step of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00054937]]. MMP1680 protein catalyses the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate. This entry also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages [[cite:PUB00054937], [cite:PUB00034422]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homologue [[cite:PUB00034422]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family of phosphoglucosamine mutases and the bacterial family of phosphoglucosamine mutases represented by [interpro:IPR006352] are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterised by three domains: [interpro:IPR005844], [interpro:IPR005845] and [interpro:IPR005846]), but are not nearest neighbours to each other.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wqa", "name" "Crystal Structure of Pyrococcus horikoshii phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase complexed with Mg2+"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03990" "phosphoglucosamine mutase"}, "cdd" {"cd03087" "PGM_like1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoglucosamine mutase, archaeal type", "short" "GlmM_arc-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1449, "taxa" 6405, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8598, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8598, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6866}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0750", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0750"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
