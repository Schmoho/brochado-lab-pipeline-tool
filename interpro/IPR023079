{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase. Sedoheptulose- 1,7-bisphosphate is involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis, catalysing the production of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and phosphate from sedoheptulose- 1,7-bisphosphate and water. The enzyme shares a high degree of similarity with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases, but it does not contain the regulatory motif present in the latter [[cite:PUB00001414], [cite:PUB00053714]].
