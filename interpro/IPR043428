{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes transmembrane subunit (TM) of Escherichia coli LivM, Pseudomonas aeruginosa BraE, and related proteins. LivM is one of two TMs of the E. coli LIV-1/LS transporter, a Periplasmic Binding Protein (PBP)-dependent ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter involved in the uptake of branched-chain amino acids (AAs). These types of transporters generally bind type 1 PBPs. PBP-dependent ABC transporters consist of a PBP, two TMs, and two cytoplasmic ABCs, and are mainly involved in importing solutes from the environment. The solute is captured by the PBP, which delivers it to a gated translocation pathway formed by the two TMs. The two ABCs bind and hydrolyze ATP and drive the transport reaction [[cite:PUB00019227], [cite:PUB00072504]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06581" "TM_PBP1_LivM_like"}, "panther" {"PTHR30482" "HIGH-AFFINITY BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "High-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system permease protein LivM-like", "short" "LivM-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5749, "taxa" 23589, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 112717, "sets" 0, "proteins" 111223, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 85576}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043428", :literature {"PUB00002417" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Landick R" "Oxender DL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
