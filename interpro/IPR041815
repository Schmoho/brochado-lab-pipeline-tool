{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ras-related protein Rab35 is a member of the large Rab GTPase family. Rab35 is involved in many cellular functions, including endocytic recycling, cytokinesisis and endosomal trafficking [[cite:PUB00092524]]. It is one of several Rab proteins to be found to participate in the regulation of osteoclast cells in rats [[cite:PUB00092525]]. In addition, Rab35 has been identified as a protein that interacts with nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) in human cells. Overexpression of NPM-ALK is a key oncogenic event in some anaplastic large-cell lymphomas; since Rab35 interacts with NPM-ALK, it may provide a target for cancer treatments [[cite:PUB00091882]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04110" "Rab GTPase family 35 (Rab35)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab35", "short" "Rab35"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 157, "taxa" 719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 199, "sets" 0, "proteins" 199, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 117}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041815", :literature {"PUB00020223" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Stenmark H" "Olkkonen VM."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11387043&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The Rab GTPase family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS3007", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11387043}, "PUB00091882" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Crockett DK" "Lin Z" "Elenitoba-Johnson KS" "Lim MS."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1207398", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Identification of NPM-ALK interacting proteins by tandem mass spectrometry.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "2617-29", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14968112}, "PUB00033000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Dumas JJ" "Zhu Z" "Connolly JL" "Lambright DG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80054-9", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural basis of activation and GTP hydrolysis in Rab proteins.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "413-23", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10196122}, "PUB00092525" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Zhao H" "Ettala O" "Vaananen HK."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
