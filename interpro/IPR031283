{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Amphoterin-induced protein (AMIGO) family consists of three cell surface leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. AMIGO-1 is expressed on fibre tracts of neuronal tissues and participates in their formation [[cite:PUB00075230]]. It has two other homologues, AMIGO-2, also known as DEGA (differentially expressed in human gastric adenocarcinoma) or as Alivin-1, due to its role in promoting survival of neurons, [[cite:PUB00075231], [cite:PUB00075232]], and AMIGO-3, the function of which is not clear. All are thought to be cell adhesion molecules. They all have the same domain structure with an extracellular, N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with six LRRs, an Ig domain, and a single transmembrane helix followed by a cytoplasmic tail.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032675", "name" "Leucine-rich repeat domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24368" "AMPHOTERIN-INDUCED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amphoterin-induced protein", "short" "AMIGO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 690, "taxa" 2534, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2312, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1682}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031283", :literature {"PUB00075230" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Kuja-Panula J" "Kiiltomaki M" "Yamashiro T" "Rouhiainen A" "Rauvala H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
