{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a glycyl radical cofactor protein, YfiD-type. YfiD of Escherichia coli, and the homologous Y06I of Bacteriophage T4, show striking sequence similarity with the C-terminal region of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL). Expression of YfiD is known to be controlled by transcription regulator FNR, and in response to pH-stress conditions [[cite:PUB00014466]]. YfiD homologues generally occur in facultative anaerobic eubacteria that have a PFL enzyme. It is thought that YfiD may act as an independent glycyl radical carrier replacing the C-terminal glycyl radical domain in PFL, perhaps in cases where PFL has undergone oxygen-induced fragmentation [[cite:PUB00014425]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This small protein, previously designated YfiD in E. coli, is closely homologous to pyruvate formate_lyase (PFL) in a region surrounding the stable glycyl radical that is prepared by the action of pyruvate formate-lyase activase, a radical SAM enzyme.
