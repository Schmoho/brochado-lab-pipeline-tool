{:metadata {:description [{"text" "RNF182 is a brain-enriched E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that stimulates E2-dependent polyubiquitination in vitro. It is upregulated in Alzheimer\"s disease (AD) brains and neuronal cells exposed to injurious insults. It interacts with ATP6V0C and promotes its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway [[cite:PUB00092839]], suggesting a very specific role in controlling the turnover of an essential component of the neurotransmitter release machinery. It also plays a role in the inhibition of TLR-triggered innate immune response by mediating 'Lys'-48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NF-kappa-B component RELA [[cite:PUB00151233]]. RNF182 contains an N-terminal C3HC4-type RING-HC finger, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain.", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46675" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE RNF182"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF182", "short" "RNF182"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 649, "taxa" 2253, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1596, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1596, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1150}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
