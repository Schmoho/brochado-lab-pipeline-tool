{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein of 413 amino acids contains a central coiled-coil domain, possibly the region that binds to clusterin. Cluap1 expression is highest in the nucleus and gradually increases during late S to G2/M phases of the cell cycle and returns to the basal level in the G0/G1 phases. In addition, it is upregulated in colon cancer tissues compared to corresponding non-cancerous mucosa. It thus plays a crucial role in the life of the cell [[cite:PUB00044200]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10234" "Clusterin-associated protein-1"}, "panther" {"PTHR21547" "CLUSTERIN ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Clusterin-associated protein-1", "short" "Clusterin-associated_protein-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 1156, "taxa" 4677, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2574, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1676}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019366", :literature {"PUB00044200" {"URL" nil, "issue" "57", "authors" ["Takahashi M" "Lin YM" "Nakamura Y" "Furukawa Y."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Isolation and characterization of a novel gene CLUAP1 whose expression is frequently upregulated in colon cancer.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "9289-94", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15480429}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019366", "name" "Clusterin-associated protein-1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 37, "alignment:full" 1677}}}
