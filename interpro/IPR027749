{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tubulin tyrosine ligase like 12 (TTLL2) is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) family. Its function is not clear. It has both SET-like and TTL-like domains, suggesting histone methylation and tubulin tyrosine ligase activities. However, this protein does not have catalytic functions related to tubulin and histone modification, though it seems to have a regulatory role in these processes [[cite:PUB00070170]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46088" "TUBULIN--TYROSINE LIGASE-LIKE PROTEIN 12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tubulin--tyrosine ligase-like protein 12", "short" "TTLL12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1305, "taxa" 5024, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2800, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2800, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1759}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027749", :literature {"PUB00070170" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Brants J" "Semenchenko K" "Wasylyk C" "Robert A" "Carles A" "Zambrano A" "Pradeau-Aubreton K" "Birck C" "Schalken JA" "Poch O" "de Mey J" "Wasylyk B."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051258", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Tubulin tyrosine ligase like 12, a TTLL family member with SET- and TTL-like domains and roles in histone and tubulin modifications and mitosis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e51258", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23251473}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004344", "name" "Tubulin-tyrosine ligase/Tubulin polyglutamylase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR027746", "name" "Probable tubulin-tyrosine ligase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027749", "name" "Tubulin--tyrosine ligase-like protein 12", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027752", "name" "Protein polyglycylase TTLL10", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
