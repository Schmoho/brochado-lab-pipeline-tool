{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerases (CMLEs), which catalyse the second step in the protocatechuate degradation to beta-ketoadipate and then to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. 4-hydroxybenzoate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, and vanillate can all be converted in one step to protocatechuate. All members of the seed alignment for this entry were chosen from within protocatechuate degradation operons of at least three genes of the pathway, and from genomes with the complete pathway through beta-ketoadipate [[cite:PUB00017793]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes CreD from Streptomyces cremeus, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cremeomycin, a light-sensitive o-diazoquinone with antibacterial and antiproliferative effects. CreD catalyses the formation of nitrous acid from nitrosuccinic acid synthesized from aspartate by CreE. It is a member of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily, most closely related to CMLEs [[cite:PUB00103676]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008948", "name" "L-Aspartase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02426" "3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase-like", "short" "Protocat_PcaB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 992, "taxa" 4724, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5118, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3897}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0273", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0273"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
