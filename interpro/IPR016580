{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hus1 is a component of the 9-1-1 cell-cycle checkpoint response complex (which consists of Rad9, Hus1, Rad1), a key complex in the coordination of DNA damage sensing, cell cycle progression and DNA repair pathways. In humans, the 9-1-1 complex is recruited to DNA lesions upon damage by the RAD17-replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader complex. It activates checkpoint response and acts as a sliding clamp platform on DNA for several proteins involved in DNA repair. The 9-1-1 complex is necessary for the recruitment of C12orf32/RHINO to sites of double-stranded breaks (DSB) occurring during the S phase [[cite:PUB00062241]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF011312" "Cell cycle checkpoint protein, HUS1 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell cycle checkpoint, Hus1", "short" "Cell_cycle_HUS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2185, "taxa" 7736, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3614, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2413}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016580", :literature {"PUB00062241" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6035", "authors" ["Cotta-Ramusino C" "McDonald ER 3rd" "Hurov K" "Sowa ME" "Harper JW" "Elledge SJ."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1203430", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "A DNA damage response screen identifies RHINO, a 9-1-1 and TopBP1 interacting protein required for ATR signaling.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1313-7", "volume" "332", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21659603}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000077", "name" "DNA damage checkpoint signaling", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005730", "name" "nucleolus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030896", "name" "checkpoint clamp complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007150", "name" "Checkpoint protein Hus1/Mec3", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016580", "name" "Cell cycle checkpoint, Hus1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
