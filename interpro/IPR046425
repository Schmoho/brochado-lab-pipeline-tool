{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ClpX is a member of the HSP (heat-shock protein) 100 family. Gel filtration and electron microscopy showed that ClpX subunits associate to form a six-membered ring that is stabilised by binding of ATP or nonhydrolysable analogs of ATP [[cite:PUB00015582]]. It functions as an ATP-dependent [[cite:PUB00015582]] molecular chaperone and is the regulatory subunit of the ClpXP protease [[cite:PUB00011891]].</p>\n\n<p>ClpXP is involved in DNA damage repair, stationary-phase gene expression, and ssrA-mediated protein quality control. To date more than 50 proteins include transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, and proteins involved in the starvation and oxidative stress responses have been identified as substrates [[cite:PUB00011892]].</p>\n\n<p>The N-terminal domain of ClpX is a C4-type zinc binding domain (ZBD) involved in substrate recognition. ZBD forms a very stable dimer that is essential for promoting the degradation of some typical ClpXP substrates such as lO and MuA [[cite:PUB00011897]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents ClpX subunit from bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038366", "name" "Zinc finger, ClpX C4-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00175" "ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit ClpX [clpX]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Clp protease, ATP-binding subunit ClpX, bacteria", "short" "ClpX_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8777, "taxa" 32952, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35369, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27331}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046425", :literature {"PUB00011891" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 9", "authors" ["Kim DY" "Wu CA" "Kim DR" "Ha SC" "Han YH" "Kim KK."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
