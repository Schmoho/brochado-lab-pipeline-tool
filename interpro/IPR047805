{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacterial cyclic GMP-AMP synthase family. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway is a central component of the cell-autonomous innate immune system in animals [[cite:PUB00151046]]. The cGAS protein is a sensor of cytosolic viral DNA and, upon sensing DNA, it produces a cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) signalling molecule  that binds to the STING protein and activates the immune response. The production of cGAMP has also been detected in bacteria and cGAMP signalling is part of a common antiphage defence system [[cite:PUB00096653]]. Phage infection triggers the production of cGAMP, which activates the phospholipase, leading to a loss of membrane integrity and to cell death before completion of phage reproduction.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xj5", "name" "Crystal structure of Vibrio cholerae DncV 3'-deoxy GTP bound form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041078" "CBASS cGAMP synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase", "short" "GAMP_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 124, "taxa" 1134, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 568, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 445}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
