{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of short Pseudomonas proteins that are potential virulence factors. The structure of [swissprot:Q9HY15] a secreted protein has been solved and deposited as PDB:3npd, from Pfam:PF13652. It is predicted that these two adjacent proteins form a single transcriptional unit based on the prediction that together they interact with their adjacent protein PotD, which is the putrescine-binding periplasmic protein in the polyamine uptake system comprising PotABCD. These two adjacent proteins are predicted to be quroum-sensing-regulated virulence factors [[cite:PUB00075641]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12843" "Putative quorum-sensing-regulated virulence factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative quorum-sensing-regulated virulence factor", "short" "QSregVF_b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 1804, "taxa" 8490, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8037, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8032, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6337}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024530", :literature {"PUB00075641" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Das D" "Chiu HJ" "Farr CL" "Grant JC" "Jaroszewski L" "Knuth MW" "Miller MD" "Tien HJ" "Elsliger MA" "Deacon AM" "Godzik A" "Lesley SA" "Wilson IA."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.24455", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of a putative quorum sensing-regulated protein (PA3611) from the Pseudomonas-specific DUF4146 family.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1086-92", "volume" "82", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24174223}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024530", "name" "Putative quorum-sensing-regulated virulence factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 71, "alignment:full" 1828}}}
