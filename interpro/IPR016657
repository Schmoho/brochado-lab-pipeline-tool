{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM; also known as phosphoglucomutase 3 or N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate mutase [[cite:PUB00080841]]).  It is an essential enzyme found in eukaryotes that reversibly catalyzes the conversion of GlcNAc-6-phosphate into GlcNAc-1-phosphate as part of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthetic pathway. UDP-GlcNAc is an essential metabolite that serves as the biosynthetic precursor of many glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides. PAGM is a member of the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily [[cite:PUB00040263]], which catalyzes the intramolecular phosphoryl transfer of sugar substrates [[cite:PUB00080845]]. The alpha-D-phosphohexomutases have four domains with a centrally located active site formed by four loops, one from each domain [[cite:PUB00042563]]. All four domains are included in this alignment model.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2dka", "name" "Crystal structure of N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate mutase, a member of the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily, in the apo-form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03086" "PGM3"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016408" "Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase", "short" "PAGM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2404, "taxa" 8085, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4100, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4093, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2628}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
