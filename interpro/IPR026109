{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GKAP1 is also called GKAP42. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) is a major cellular receptor of cGMP, playing important roles in cGMP-dependent signal transduction pathways [[cite:PUB00060028]]. Using the yeast two-hybrid system with cGK-Ialpha as a bait, a male germ- cell-specific 42kDa protein, GKAP42 (42kDa cGMP-dependent protein kinase anchoring protein) has been identified [[cite:PUB00060028]].</p>\n\n<p>The N-terminal 66 amino acids of cGK-Ialpha were shown to be sufficient for association with GKAP42, but GKAP42 did not interact with cGK-Ibeta, cGK-II or cAMP-dependent protein kinase [[cite:PUB00060028]]. GKAP42 mRNA is specifically expressed in testis, where it is restricted to spermatocytes and early-round spermatids [[cite:PUB00060028]]. GKAP42 is believed to function as an anchoring protein for cGK-Ialpha, and it is thought that cGK-Ialpha may participate in germ-cell development through phosphorylation of Golgi-associated proteins such as GKAP42 [[cite:PUB00060028]].</p>\n\n<p>A recurring chromosomal aberration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is deletion of the long arm of chromosome 9, del(9q) [[cite:PUB00060401]]. The Commonly Deleted Region (CDR) has been defined to less than 2.4 Mb, and found to contain 7 known genes, including GKAP42. The results of mutation and expression analyses of these genes are consistent with a model of tumour suppression mediated by haploinsufficiency of critical genes in del(9q) AML.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02083" "G kinase-anchoring protein 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR14899" "G KINASE ANCHORING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G kinase-anchoring protein 1", "short" "GKAP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 576, "taxa" 2600, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1734, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1268, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 798}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026109", :literature {"PUB00060401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sweetser DA" "Peniket AJ" "Haaland C" "Blomberg AA" "Zhang Y" "Zaidi ST" "Dayyani F" "Zhao Z" "Heerema NA" "Boultwood J" "Dewald GW" "Paietta E" "Slovak ML" "Willman CL" "Wainscoat JS" "Bernstein ID" "Daly SB."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Chromosomes Cancer", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gcc.20236", "medline_journal" "Genes Chromosomes Cancer", "title" "Delineation of the minimal commonly deleted segment and identification of candidate tumor-suppressor genes in del(9q) acute myeloid leukemia.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "279-91", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16015647}, "PUB00060028" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Yuasa K" "Omori K" "Yanaka N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
