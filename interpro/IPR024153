{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Suprabasin (SBN) is expressed in mouse and human differentiating keratinocytes, being involved in epidermal differentiation which may play a role in skin barrier formation [[cite:PUB00055492]]. It has been proposed to be a component of the cornified envelope, an essential structure for skin protection [[cite:PUB00151663], [cite:PUB00151664]]. Its exact function is not yet clear; it has been associated with multiple diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders [[cite:PUB00151663], [cite:PUB00151664], [cite:PUB00151665]]. It is a secreted molecule that may induce cellular signalling (AKT, WNT/beta-catenin, and/or p38MAPK signalling) and processes (migration, proliferation, neovascularization apoptosis- and immune-resistance). It contains a repeated sequence GxHH, with no other similar sequence in the human proteome, which suggests an evolutionarily unique and conserved role [[cite:PUB00151664]]. It has also been described a FG (Phe-Gly) motif, which is common in scaffold proteins (keratin 1/2/10 and fillagrin-2 in addition to SBSN) [[cite:PUB00151663]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23243" "SUPRABASAL-SPECIFIC PROTEIN SUPRABASIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Suprabasin", "short" "Suprabasin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 172, "taxa" 884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 417, "sets" 0, "proteins" 417, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 231}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024153", :literature {"PUB00055492" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["Park GT" "Lim SE" "Jang SI" "Morasso MI."], "ISO_journal" "J.
