{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a widespread mechanism of bacterial competition. CDI+ bacteria deliver the toxic C-terminal region of contact-dependent inhibition A proteins (CdiA-CT) into neighbouring target bacteria and produce CDI immunity proteins (CdiI) which bind CdiA-CT domains and neutralize their toxic activity to protect against self-inhibition. CdiI immunity proteins are also variable and only neutralize their cognate CdiA-CT toxins. Structure analysis of CdiI from Escherichia coli 536 (EC536) shows that is composed of a single domain and that it blocks the interaction with substrate, strongly suggesting that the immunity protein occludes the nuclease active site [[cite:PUB00091158]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF18616" "CDI immunity proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunity protein CdiI", "short" "CdiI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 241, "taxa" 1264, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 800, "sets" 0, "proteins" 800, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 552}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040547", :literature {"PUB00091158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Johnson PM" "Beck CM" "Morse RP" "Garza-Sanchez F" "Low DA" "Hayes CS" "Goulding CW."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
