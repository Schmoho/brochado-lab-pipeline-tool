{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains homologues of lantibiotic ABC transporter permease subunit NisG, which are highly hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins, and part of the bacitracin ABC transport system that confers resistance to the Gram-positive bacteria in which this system operates, particularly to the lantibiotic nisin. Lantibiotics are small peptides, produced by Gram-positive bacteria, which are ribosomally-synthesized as pre-peptides and act by disrupting membrane integrity. Genes encoding the lantibiotic ABC transporter subunits are highly organized in operons containing all the genes required for maturation, transport, immunity, and synthesis. In Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus uberis, the lantibiotic nisin is active against other Gram-positive bacteria via various modes of actions; however, its self-protection against the pore-forming nisin is mediated by the ABC transporter composed of NisF, NisE and NisG. In Streptococcus uberis, similar proteins provide self-protection against the pore-forming lantibiotic nisin U. This family contains the NisG and related permease subunits that transport nisin to the surface and expel it from the membrane [[cite:PUB00145694], [cite:PUB00145704], [cite:PUB00145703], [cite:PUB00145698], [cite:PUB00145701]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21810" "lantibiotic immunity ABC transporter NisG family permease (also called ABC-2 transporter NisG family permease) subunit, and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC-2 transporter permease NisG-like", "short" "ABC_permease_NisG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 75, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 93, "sets" 0, "proteins" 93, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 71}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049527", :literature {"PUB00145694" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5-6", "authors" ["Immonen T" "Saris PE."], "ISO_journal" "DNA Seq", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "DNA Seq", "title" "Characterization of the nisFEG operon of the nisin Z producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis N8 strain.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "263-74", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10524754}, "PUB00145698" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["LeBel G" "Vaillancourt K" "Frenette M" "Gottschalk M" "Grenier D."], "ISO_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "title" "Suicin 90-1330 from a nonvirulent strain of Streptococcus suis: a nisin-related lantibiotic active on gram-positive swine pathogens.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "5484-92", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24973067}, "PUB00145701" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["O'Connor PM" "O'Shea EF" "Guinane CM" "O'Sullivan O" "Cotter PD" "Ross RP" "Hill C."], "ISO_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "title" "Nisin H Is a New Nisin Variant Produced by the Gut-Derived Strain Streptococcus hyointestinalis DPC6484.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "3953-60", "volume" "81", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25841003}, "PUB00145703" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["AlKhatib Z" "Lagedroste M" "Zaschke J" "Wagner M" "Abts A" "Fey I" "Kleinschrodt D" "Smits SH."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiologyopen", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiologyopen", "title" "The C-terminus of nisin is important for the ABC transporter NisFEG to confer immunity in Lactococcus lactis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "752-63", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25176038}, "PUB00145704" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Stein T" "Heinzmann S" "Solovieva I" "Entian KD."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Function of Lactococcus lactis nisin immunity genes nisI and nisFEG after coordinated expression in the surrogate host Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "89-94", "volume" "278", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12379654}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049527", "name" "ABC-2 transporter permease NisG-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
