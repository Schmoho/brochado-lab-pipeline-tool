{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Arabidopsis, SPA1/2/3/4 play a central role in suppression of photomorphogenesis. SPA1 and SPA2 predominate in dark-grown seedlings, whereas SPA3 and SPA4 prevalently regulate the elongation growth in adult plants [[cite:PUB00096570]]. SPAs contain a kinase-like domain, a coiled-coil domain and the WD-repeats. SPAs and COP1 (a ring finger E3 ubiquitin ligase) can form homo- and heterodimers via their respective coiled-coil domains, and the COP1/SPA complex forms a tetramer of two COP1 and two SPA proteins [[cite:PUB00096571]]. The SPA proteins can self-associate or interact with each other, forming a heterogeneous group of SPA-COP1 complexes [[cite:PUB00096573]]. Besides recognizing substrates, both COP1 and SPA bind DDB1 in the CUL4 complex through their C-terminal WD-repeat domains. They serve as DDB1-CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) similar to other substrate adaptors in CUL4-based E3 ligases. SPA1 interacts with photoreceptor cry2 via its kinase-like domain, with cry1 via its WD-repeat domain and with phytochromes possibly via both [[cite:PUB00096572]]. SPAs have also been shown to regulate the phyB-PIF4 module at high ambient temperature [[cite:PUB00096574]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44218" "PROTEIN SPA1-RELATED 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD-repeat protein SPA1/2/3/4", "short" "SPA1/2/3/4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 293, "taxa" 1234, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2297, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2297, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1373}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044630", :literature {"PUB00096573" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Laubinger S" "Hoecker U."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The SPA1-like proteins SPA3 and SPA4 repress photomorphogenesis in the light.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "373-85", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12887588}, "PUB00096572" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hoecker U."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
