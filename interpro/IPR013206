{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These peptides are designated Leucophaea maderae (Madeira cockroach) tachykinin-related peptides (Lem TRPs). Some were isolated from the midgut of L. maderae, whereas others appear to be brain specific. The Lem TRPs of the brain are myotropic and induce increases in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions and tonus of hindgut muscle in L. maderae [[cite:PUB00017110]]. They were also isolated from brain-corpora, cardiaca-corpora, allata-suboesophageal ganglion extracts of Locusta migratoria (Migratory locust). They stimulate visceral muscle contractions of the oviduct and the foregut of L. migratoria [[cite:PUB00017137]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08262" "Leucophaea maderae tachykinin-related peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leucophaea maderae tachykinin-related peptide", "short" "Lem_TRP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 35, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013206", :literature {"PUB00017110" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Muren JE" "Nassel DR."], "ISO_journal" "Peptides", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0196-9781(96)00243-4", "medline_journal" "Peptides", "title" "Seven tachykinin-related peptides isolated from the brain of the Madeira cockroach: evidence for tissue-specific expression of isoforms.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "7-15", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9114447}, "PUB00017137" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Schoofs L" "Holman GM" "Hayes TK" "Kochansky JP" "Nachman RJ" "De Loof A."], "ISO_journal" "Regul.
