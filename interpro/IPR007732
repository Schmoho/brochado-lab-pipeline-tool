{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Flavocytochrome b558 is the catalytic core of the respiratory-burst oxidase, an enzyme complex that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of O2 into the superoxide anion O2 in phagocytic cells. Flavocytochrome b558 is anchored in the plasma membrane. It is a heterodimer that consists of a large glycoprotein gp91phox (phox forphagocyte oxidase) (beta subunit) and a small protein p22phox (alpha subunit). The other components of the respiratory-burst oxidase are water-soluble proteins of cytosolic origin, namely p67phox, p47phox, p40phox and Rac. Upon cell stimulation, they assemble with the membrane-bound flavocytochrome b558 which becomes activated and generates O2- [[cite:PUB00010247]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05038" "Cytochrome Cytochrome b558 alpha-subunit"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019635" "Cytochrome b558, alpha subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR15168" "CYTOCHROME B-245 LIGHT CHAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b558 alpha-subunit", "short" "Cyt_b558_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 604, "taxa" 2307, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 970, "sets" 0, "proteins" 917, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 609}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007732", :literature {"PUB00010247" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Ushio-Fukai M" "Zafari AM" "Fukui T" "Ishizaka N" "Griendling KK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
