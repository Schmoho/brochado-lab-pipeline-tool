{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of plant asparagine-rich proteins containing a Development and Cell Death (DCD) domain which is present in proteins with different architectures, some of them contain additional recognisable motifs, like the KELCH repeats or the ParB domain. They are involved in stress signalling pathway that mediate cell death in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and osmotic stress [[cite:PUB00097175], [cite:PUB00097177]]. Including in this entry are soybean DCD domain-containing proteins NRP-A/B, NRP from Arabidopsis and B2 protein from carrot. NRP was first found in soybean as a component of the early pathogen response and was induced under ER stress [[cite:PUB00097177], [cite:PUB00094790]]. In Arabidopsis, NRP contributes to the initial phase of responses to abiotic and biotic stress signals. It binds the phytochrome-associated protein phosphatase FYPP3 and facilitates FYPP3 degradation to promote abscisic acid (ABA) response, a regulatory circuit which links intracellular trafficking with ABA signaling [[cite:PUB00094790], [cite:PUB00097174]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5f72", "name" "De novo design and crystallographic validation of antibodies targeting a pre-selected epitope"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46034" "PTHR46034"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DCD domain-containing protein NRP-like", "short" "NRP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 297, "taxa" 1531, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3386, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3386, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1984}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044832", :literature {"PUB00094790" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Zhou R" "Zhu T" "Han L" "Liu M" "Xu M" "Liu Y" "Han D" "Qiu D" "Gong Q" "Liu X."], "ISO_journal" "J.
