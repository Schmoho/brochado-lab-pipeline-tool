{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins belonging to the HpcH/HpaI aldolase family. Proteins in this entry include citrate lyase subunit beta, malyl-CoA lyase and (3S)-malyl-CoA thioesterase. This entry also includes beta-methylmalyl-CoA lyase (rrnAC0690) from Haloarcula marismortui.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citrate lyase catalyses the magnesium-dependent cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate. In bacteria, this reaction is involved in citrate fermentation. The bacterial enzyme is composed of three subunits: alpha, beta and gamma. Catalytic activity resides on the alpha- and beta-subunits, whereas the gamma-subunit serves as an acyl carrier protein (ACP) [[cite:PUB00014742]]. Mammalian citrate lyase beta proteins display similarity to the bacterial enzymes [[cite:PUB00014726]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malyl-CoA lyase catalyses the reversible condensation of glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA to L-malyl-CoA and the reversible condensation of glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA to beta-methylmalyl-CoA [[cite:PUB00070127]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3S)-malyl-CoA thioesterase catalyses the hydrolysis of (3S)-malyl-CoA to (3S)-malate and free CoA [[cite:PUB00070128]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6chu", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF PROTEIN CITE FROM MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS IN COMPLEX WITH MAGNESIUM AND ACETATE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015813", "name" "Pyruvate/Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR040442", "name" "Pyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015582" "Citrate lyase, beta subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate lyase beta subunit-like", "short" "Citrate_lyase_beta/mcl1/mcl2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6359, "taxa" 23395, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38917, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38730, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29836}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
