{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases ([ec:1.2.7.12]), found in methanogenic archaea, are molybdenum or tungsten iron-sulphur proteins containing a pterin dinucleotide cofactor. Formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase catalyses the reversible reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>and methanofuran via N-carboxymethanofuran (carbamate) to N-formylmethanofuran, the first and second steps in methanogenesis from CO<sub>2</sub>[[cite:PUB00015859]]. There are two isoenzymes of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase: a tungsten-containing isoenzyme (Fwd) and a molybdenum-containing isoenzyme (Fmd). The tungsten isoenzyme is constitutively transcribed, whereas transcription of the molybdenum operon is induced by molybdate [[cite:PUB00000170]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit E of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (FmdE).
