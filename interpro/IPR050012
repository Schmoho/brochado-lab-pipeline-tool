{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase from Clostridioides difficile  and related bacterial proteins.The trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase HypD is a glycyl-radical enzyme that depends on an activator that is a radical SAM enzyme. It catalyses the dehydration of the non-proteinogenic amino acid trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp), the most abundant modified residue in human proteins, to produce delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), being involved in the anaerobic degradation of 4-hydroxyproline [[cite:PUB00090957]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043068" "trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase", "short" "Glycl_HYPD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1519, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1216, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 940}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
