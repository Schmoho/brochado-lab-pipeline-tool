Examples of 7-deazapurines that are important for cell function include the bacterial/eukaryotic modified tRNA base queuosine and the archaeal modified base archaeosine. 7-cyano-7-deazaguanosine (preQ0) is the precursor for all 7-deazapurines and is produced from GTP in a four-step pathway [[cite:PUB00035932], [cite:PUB00056816]]. 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase catalyses the third step in this pathway, the conversion of 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin to 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03963" "putative 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase QueE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase, Clostridial form", "short" "7-CO-7-deazaGua_synth_put_Clo"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 160, "taxa" 629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 487, "sets" 0, "proteins" 487, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 402}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
