{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This signature defines serine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family S24 (LexA family, clan SF).

UmuD'2, is the homodimeric component of DNA pol V, which is produced from UmuD by RecA-facilitated self-cleavage. The first 24 N-terminal residues of UmuD are removed; UmuD'2 is a DNA lesion bypass polymerase [[cite:PUB00011870], [cite:PUB00011871]]. MucA [[cite:PUB00011872], [cite:PUB00011873]], like UmuD, is a plasmid encoded a DNA polymerase (pol RI) which is converted into the active lesion-bypass polymerase by a self-cleavage reaction involving RecA [[cite:PUB00011874]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group of proteins also contains proteins classified as non-peptidase homologues as they either have been found experimentally to be without peptidase activity, or lack amino acid residues that are believed to be essential for catalytic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036286", "name" "LexA/Signal peptidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00726" "LEXASERPTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S24, LexA-like", "short" "Peptidase_S24_LexA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7563, "taxa" 29351, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 127270, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42496, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32742}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
