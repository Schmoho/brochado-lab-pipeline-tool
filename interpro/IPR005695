{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gram-negative bacteria have evolved transport complexes that export macromolecules and toxic substances such as heavy metals across the two membranes of the cell envelope in a single energy coupled step. The process requires (1) a cytoplasmic membrane export system, (2) a membrane fusion protein (MFP), and (3) an outer membrane factor. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the MFPs cluster in accordance with the type of cytoplasmic membrane transport systems with which they function -proteins in this family are associated with reisistance to heavy metal poisoning.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00999" "CzcB/NccB family metal efflux transporter periplasmic adaptor subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cobalt/zinc/cadmium resistance protein CzcB-like", "short" "Co/Zn/Cd_resistance_CzcB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 41, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005695", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046873", "name" "metal ion transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030001", "name" "metal ion transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006143", "name" "RND efflux pump, membrane fusion protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005695", "name" "Cobalt/zinc/cadmium resistance protein CzcB-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022824", "name" "Multidrug resistance protein MdtA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022871", "name" "Para-hydroxybenzoic acid efflux pump, subunit AaeA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
