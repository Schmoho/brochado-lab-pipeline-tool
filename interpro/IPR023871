{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Mycofactocin precursor peptide peptidase MftE, a peptidase involved in the biosynthesis of the enzyme cofactor mycofactocin (MFT) [[cite:PUB00096693]]. It catalyses the cleavage of the MftC-modified MftA peptide to liberate its final two residues, which consist of a cross-linked valine-decarboxylated tyrosine dipeptide (named 3-amino-5-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-4,4-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidin-2-one or ADHP) [[cite:PUB00096694]]. It is also required for alcohol metabolism in Mycobacteria [[cite:PUB00096693], [cite:PUB00096692]].
