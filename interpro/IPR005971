{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Synonym: dark protochlorophyllide reductase</p>\n\n<p>Protochlorophyllide reductase catalyzes the reductive formation of chlorophyllide from protochlorophyllide during biosynthesis of chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls. Three genes, bchL, bchN and bchB, are involved in light-independent protochlorophyllide reduction in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis. In cyanobacteria, algae, and gymnosperms, three similar genes, chlL, chlN and chlB are involved in protochlorophyllide reduction during chlorophylls biosynthesis. BchL/chlL, bchN/chlN and bchB/chlB exhibit significant sequence similarity to the nifH, nifD and nifK subunits of nitrogenase, respectively. Nitrogenase catalyzes the reductive formation of ammonia from dinitrogen [[cite:PUB00007918]]. The light-independent (dark) form of protochlorophyllide reductase plays a key role in the ability of gymnosperms, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria to form chlorophyll in the dark. Genetic and sequence analyses have indicated that dark protochlorophyllide reductase consists of three protein subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of nitrogenase, which catalyzes the reductive formation of ammonia from dinitrogen. Dark protochlorophyllide reductase activity was shown to be dependent on the presence of all three subunits, ATP, and the reductant dithionite.</p>\n\n<p>The BchL peptide (ChlL in chloroplast and cyanobacteria) is an ATP-binding iron-sulphur protein of the dark form protochlorophyllide reductase, an enzyme similar to nitrogenase [[cite:PUB00007918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3fwy", "name" "Crystal structure of the L protein of Rhodobacter sphaeroides light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase (BchL) with MgADP bound: a homologue of the nitrogenase Fe protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00355" "Light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase iron-sulfur ATP-binding protein [bchL]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01281" "ferredoxin:protochlorophyllide reductase (ATP-dependent) iron-sulfur ATP-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase, iron-sulphur ATP-binding protein", "short" "Protochlorophyllide_ATP-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 624, "taxa" 5070, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3198, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3198, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2473}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1004", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1004"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
