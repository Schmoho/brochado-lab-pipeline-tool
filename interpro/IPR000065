{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Leptin, a metabolic monitor of food intake and energy need, is expressed by the ob obesity gene. The protein may function as part of a signalling pathway from adipose tissue that acts to regulate the size of the body fat depot [[cite:PUB00004193]], the hormone effectively turning the brain's appetite message off when it senses that the body is satiated. Obese humans have high levels of the protein, suggesting a similarity to type II (adult onset) diabetes, in which sufferers over-produce insulin, but can't respond to it metabolically - they have become insulin resistant. Similarly, it is thought that obese individuals may be leptin resistant.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7z3p", "name" "Crystal structure of the mouse leptin:LepR-CRH2 encounter complex to 1.95 A resolution."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001837" "Leptin"}, "panther" {"PTHR11724" "LEPTIN"}, "prints" {"PR00495" "LEPTIN"}, "pfam" {"PF02024" "Leptin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leptin", "short" "Leptin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 1172, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 690, "sets" 0, "proteins" 683, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 514}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000065", :literature {"PUB00004193" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6505", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Proenca R" "Maffei M" "Barone M" "Leopold L" "Friedman JM."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/372425a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Positional cloning of the mouse obese gene and its human homologue.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "425-32", "volume" "372", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7984236}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005179", "name" "hormone activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007165", "name" "signal transduction", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005576", "name" "extracellular region", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000065", "name" "Leptin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 292}}}
