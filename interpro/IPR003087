{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Murine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin precursor (NGAL) exhibits a 7-10-fold increase in expression in cultured mouse kidney cells infected by Simian virus 40 (SV40) or other viruses [[cite:PUB00006348]]. NGAL has been identified as a major secretory product of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cultured mouse macrophages, suggesting that the protein might function in defence against infection [[cite:PUB00006483]]. Recently, NGAL has been shown to be identical to SIP24, a previously identified secretory product of quiescent mouse fibroblasts induced by serum, dexamethasone, basic fibroblast growth factor, and phorbol ester [[cite:PUB00006330]]. Mouse plasma levels of NGAL rise as a result of increased expression levels in the liver, in response to intramuscular turpentine injection. Tumour necrosis factor can regulate NGAL expression in cultured liver cells. These findings indicate that NGAL is a positive acute phase protein and may possess immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory properties, possibly linked to its regulation of neutrophil gelatinase or other plasma protein [[cite:PUB00006549]]. The uterus is also a major site of NGAL synthesis, especially at parturition, when expression increases significantly, suggesting a physiological role for the protein in uterine secretions [[cite:PUB00006489]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bx8", "name" "Engineered Human Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), apo-form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012674", "name" "Calycin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01275" "NGELATINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin/epididymal-specific lipocalin-12", "short" "LCN2/LCN12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 66, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 131, "taxa" 454, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2909, "sets" 0, "proteins" 500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 324}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003087", :literature {"PUB00006348" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Garay-Rojas E" "Harper M" "Hraba-Renevey S" "Kress M."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(95)00896-9", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "An apparent autocrine mechanism amplifies the dexamethasone- and retinoic acid-induced expression of mouse lipocalin-encoding gene 24p3.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "173-80", "volume" "170", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8666241}, "PUB00006483" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Meheus LA" "Fransen LM" "Raymackers JG" "Blockx HA" "Van Beeumen JJ" "Van Bun SM" "Van de Voorde A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
