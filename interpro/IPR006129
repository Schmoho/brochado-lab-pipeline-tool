{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Streptococcus pneumoniae psaA gene encodes a protein with significant similarity to previously-reported Streptococcal proteins, SsaB (80% similarity) and FimA (92.3% similarity), from Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus parasanguis [[cite:PUB00002030]]. These homologues are associated with bacterial adhesion, and PsaA may play a similar role [[cite:PUB00002030]].</p>\n\n<p>The SsaB protein has a putative hydrophobic 19-amino-acid signal sequence yielding a 32,620-Mr secreted protein [[cite:PUB00002025]]. SsaB is hydrophilic and appears not to have a hydrophobic membrane anchor in its C-terminal region. A high degree of similarity exists between S. sanguis ssaB and type 1 fimbrial genes [[cite:PUB00002025]]. Comparison of the gene products reveals close similarity of the two proteins. It is thought that ssaB adhesion may play a role in oral colonisation by binding either to a receptor on saliva or to a receptor on Actinomyces.</p>\n\n<p>This sub-family is described by from conserved regions spanning the full alignment length, focusing on those sections that characterise the adhesin B precursors but distinguish them from the rest of the adhesin family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zk9", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF PNEUMOCOCCAL SURFACE ANTIGEN PSAA D280N IN THE METAL-FREE, OPEN STATE"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00691" "ADHESINB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adhesin B", "short" "AdhesinB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 79, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4964, "taxa" 20937, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 174650, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31890, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24289}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006129", :literature {"PUB00002030" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sampson JS" "O'Connor SP" "Stinson AR" "Tharpe JA" "Russell H."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
