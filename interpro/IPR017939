{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the human protein C7orf24 ([swissprot:O75223]) which has been used as a cancer marker with a potential role in cell proliferation. It has been characterised as gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase (GGCT), a homodimer of two 21kDa subunits, that catalyses the formation of 5-oxoproline (2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, pyroglutamic acid) from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides ([ec:2.3.2.4]) [[cite:PUB00043815]].</p>\n\n<p><reaction>L-gamma-glutamyl-L-amino acid -> 5-oxoproline + L-amino acid</reaction></p>\n\n<p>The structure of GGCT has been solved. Its topology is unrelated to other enzymes associated with cyclotransferase-like activity and its structure has been termed the GGCT-fold, which appears to be related to the BtrG-like superfamily. A potential active site pocket contains a highly conserved glutamic acid (Glu(98)), which when converted to either Ala or Gln completely inactivates the enzyme without altering the overall fold [[cite:PUB00043815]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes GGCT gliK, GGCT aclK and GGCT verK from fungi. GGCT gliK is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of gliotoxin, a member of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) class of toxins characterised by a disulfide bridged cyclic dipeptide [[cite:PUB00083161], [cite:PUB00083162]]. GGCT aclK mediates the biosynthesis of aspirochlorine [[cite:PUB00094238]]. GGCT verK mediates the biosynthesis of 11'-deoxyverticillin A, one of the dimeric epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) from the verticillin family that act as mycotoxins [[cite:PUB00094237]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3cry", "name" "Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036568", "name" "Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12935" "GAMMA-GLUTAMYLCYCLOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase", "short" "G-Glutamylcylcotransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3840, "taxa" 14098, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12688, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12688, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8979}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
