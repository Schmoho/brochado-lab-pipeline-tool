{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ZIP family consists of zinc transport proteins and many putative metal transporters found in al cellular organisms, including the Arabidopsis thaliana ZIP protein family which is responsible for zinc uptake in the plant [[cite:PUB00008168]]. ZIP proteins play essential roles in metal metabolism/homeostasis and are widely involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes.</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of a ZIP from Bordetella bronchiseptica showed eight transmembrane helices (TMs) forming a tightly associated helix bundle, where four TMs create an inner bundle surrounded by the other four TMs and a a binuclear metal centre (BMC) is harboured in the transport pathway [[cite:PUB00103883]]. The two associated metal binding sites in the BMC play different roles: one of them is the key transport site, whereas the other, the auxiliary site, is required not only to achieve maximal zinc transport activity but also to maintain a uniform activity in a broad pH range [[cite:PUB00103882]].</p>\n\n<p>ZIP4, a human member of this family, is related to a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by the inability to absorb sufficient zinc [[cite:PUB00103884]]. ZIPCO,  a Plasmodium member, has a crucial role in the parasite liver-stage development [[cite:PUB00153751]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8j1m", "name" "Crystal structure of a crosslinked variant of BbZIP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02535" "ZIP Zinc transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc/iron permease", "short" "ZIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 552, "proteomes" 7282, "taxa" 31713, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 80026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 73109, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 50078}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003689", :literature {"PUB00008168" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Grotz N" "Fox T" "Connolly E" "Park W" "Guerinot ML" "Eide D."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
