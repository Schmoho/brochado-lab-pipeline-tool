{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family, GldM, is named for the member from Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae), which is required for a type of rapid gliding motility found in certain members of the Bacteriodetes [[cite:PUB00045359]]. However, members of this protein family are found also in several members of the Bacteriodetes that appear not to be motile. The best conserved region, toward the N terminus, is centred on a highly hydrobobic probable transmembrane helix. Two paralogs are found in Cytophaga hutchinsonii.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ey4", "name" "Periplasmic domain (residues 36-513) of GldM"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03517" "gliding motility protein GldM"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility-associated protein GldM", "short" "Motility-assoc_prot_GldM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 881, "taxa" 2750, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2995, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2995, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2305}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019859", :literature {"PUB00045359" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Braun TF" "Khubbar MK" "Saffarini DA" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
