{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MJ_1101 protein from Methanococcus jannaschii has been characterised as the GlmU, a bifunctional enzyme (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase/glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) catalyzing the final two steps of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis. GlmU is responsible for the acetylation of GlcN-1-P to GlcNAc-1-P, and for the uridyl transfer from UTP to GlcNAc-1-P, to produce UDP-GlcNAc and pyrophosphate. It also catalyses the reverse reaction, i.e. the cleavage of UDP-GlcNAc with pyrophosphate to form UTP and GlcNAc-1-P. To a lesser extent, is also able to use dUTP or dTTP as the nucleotide substrate, but not CTP, ATP or GTP [[cite:PUB00054937]].</p>\r\n<p>Many of the proteins identified by this entry originate from genes in proximity to the glmS and glmM genes and are also presumed to be GlmU.  However, some archaeal genomes contain multiple closely-related homologues from this family and it is not clear what the substrate specificity is for each of them.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also contains the bifunctional sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidylyltransferase/acetyltransferase.
