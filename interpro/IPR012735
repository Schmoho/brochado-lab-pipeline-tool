{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two types of dihydroxyacetone kinase (glycerone kinase) are described. In yeast and a few bacteria, e.g. Citrobacter freundii, the enzyme is a single chain that uses ATP as phosphoryl donor and is designated [ec:2.7.1.29]. By contract, Escherichia coli and many other bacterial species have a multisubunit form with a phosphoprotein donor related to PTS transport proteins. This family represents a protein, unique to the firmicutes (low GC Gram-positives), that appears to be a divergent second copy of the K subunit of that complex; its gene is always found in operons with the other three proteins of the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes DhaKLM operon coactivator DhaQ from Streptococcus lactis. It forms a heterotetramer with DhaS and functions as a transcriptional regulator [[cite:PUB00036010]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2iu4", "name" "Dihydroxyacetone kinase operon co-activator Dha-DhaQ"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02362" "DhaKLM operon coactivator DhaQ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihydroxyacetone kinase DhaK, subunit 1b", "short" "DhaK_1b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 61, "taxa" 422, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 608, "sets" 0, "proteins" 608, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 399}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012735", :literature {"PUB00036010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Christen S" "Srinivas A" "Bahler P" "Zeller A" "Pridmore D" "Bieniossek C" "Baumann U" "Erni B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
