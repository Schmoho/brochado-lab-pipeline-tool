{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of plastid-lipid-associated protein (PAP) from plants and Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The plant proteins in this entry are also known as plant fibrillins. Aarabidopsis PAP1 is involved in chloroplast stress-related jasmonate biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00089890]]. PAP6, also known as FIBRILLIN4, is required for plastoglobule development and stress resistance in apple and Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00089891]]. FIBRILLIN5 has been shown to be involved in the plastoquinone-9 biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis and rice [[cite:PUB00092853], [cite:PUB00092854]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31906" "PLASTID-LIPID-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4, CHLOROPLASTIC-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plastid-lipid-associated protein", "short" "PAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 525, "taxa" 2726, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7660, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7660, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4872}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039633", :literature {"PUB00092853" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kim EH" "Lee DW" "Lee KR" "Jung SJ" "Jeon JS" "Kim HU."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "Conserved Function of Fibrillin5 in the Plastoquinone-9 Biosynthetic Pathway in Arabidopsis and Rice.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1197", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28751900}, "PUB00092854" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kim EH" "Lee Y" "Kim HU."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Fibrillin 5 Is Essential for Plastoquinone-9 Biosynthesis by Binding to Solanesyl Diphosphate Synthases in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "2956-71", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26432861}, "PUB00089890" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Youssef A" "Laizet Y" "Block MA" "Marechal E" "Alcaraz JP" "Larson TR" "Pontier D" "Gaffe J" "Kuntz M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04067.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Plant lipid-associated fibrillin proteins condition jasmonate production under photosynthetic stress.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "436-45", "volume" "61", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19906042}, "PUB00089891" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Singh DK" "Maximova SN" "Jensen PJ" "Lehman BL" "Ngugi HK" "McNellis TW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.164095", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "FIBRILLIN4 is required for plastoglobule development and stress resistance in apple and Arabidopsis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1281-93", "volume" "154", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20813909}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039633", "name" "Plastid-lipid-associated protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
