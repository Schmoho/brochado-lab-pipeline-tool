{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This set of sequences describe the alpha subunit of a family of known and putative heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidases. Five operons of such oxidases are found in Rhizobium loti (Mesorhizobium loti) and three in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a high enough copy number to suggest that not all members share the same function. Sarcosine oxidase catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to glycine. The reaction converts tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate [[cite:PUB00033240]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bhk", "name" "Crystal structure of R49K mutant of monomeric sarcosine oxidase crystallized in phosphate as precipitant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00516" "Monomeric sarcosine oxidase [soxA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sarcosine oxidase, monomeric", "short" "SoxA_mon"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 175, "sets" 0, "proteins" 175, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 117}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
