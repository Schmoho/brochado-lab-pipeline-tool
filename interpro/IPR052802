{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes KNTC1 (also known as ROD) proteins, a crucial component of the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring cells do not exit mitosis prematurely [[cite:PUB00012302], [cite:PUB00154939], [cite:PUB00044470]]. KNTC1 is required for the assembly of essential complexes onto kinetochores, including dynein-dynactin and MAD1-MAD2 in mammals, and dynein-dynactin and mdf-1-mdf-2 in C. elegans. KNTC1 is the major subunit of the RZZ (ROD-Zwilch-ZW10) complex, which plays a significant role in spindle assembly, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, and spindle pole separation [[cite:PUB00154940]]. The RZZ complex also recruits proteins like spdl-1 to kinetochores, regulates the attachment of the NDC80 complex to microtubules, and is implicated in nuclear envelope breakdown. These proteins are vital for chromosome segregation, embryonic development, and maintaining genomic stability during cell division.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15688" "KINETOCHORE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kinetochore-associated protein 1", "short" "KNTC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 998, "taxa" 3905, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2156, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2156, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 412}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052802", :literature {"PUB00154939" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 17", "authors" ["Scaerou F" "Starr DA" "Piano F" "Papoulas O" "Karess RE" "Goldberg ML."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.114.17.3103", "medline_journal" "J Cell Sci", "title" "The ZW10 and Rough Deal checkpoint proteins function together in a large, evolutionarily conserved complex targeted to the kinetochore.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "3103-14", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11590237}, "PUB00044470" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kops GJ" "Kim Y" "Weaver BA" "Mao Y" "McLeod I" "Yates JR 3rd" "Tagaya M" "Cleveland DW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
