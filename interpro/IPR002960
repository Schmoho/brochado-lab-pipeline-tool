{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytokines can be grouped into a family on the basis of sequence, functional and structural similarities [[cite:PUB00002042], [cite:PUB00004130], [cite:PUB00015257]]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (also known as TNF-alpha or cachectin) is a monocyte-derived cytotoxin that has been implicated in tumour regression, septic shock and cachexia [[cite:PUB00006091], [cite:PUB00006095]]. The protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine [[cite:PUB00006101]]. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00006098]]. Both the mature protein and a partially-processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide [[cite:PUB00006098]].</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of different families of TNF, but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that are recognised by their specific receptors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha or TNF-beta) and lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta) are related cytokines produced by lymphocytes. The proteins are cytotoxic for a wide range of tumour cells in vitro and in vivo.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of TNF-beta has been determined to 1.9 A using X-ray crystallography and phase determination via molecular replacement using TNF-alpha. Like TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin folds to form a 'jellyroll' Î²-sheet sandwich. Three-fold related LT subunits form a trimer primarily stabilised by hydrophobic interactions. A cluster of 6 basic residues around the 3-fold axis is thought to account for the acid lability of the trimer. Although the structural cores of TNF-alpha and LT are similar, insertions and deletions relative to TNF-alpha occur in loops at the 'top' of the LT trimer, significantly altering the local structure. The sites of two mutations (Asp-50 and Tyr-108) that abolish the cytotoxicity of LT are contained within poorly-ordered loops that flank the cleft between neighbouring subunits at the base of the molecule, suggesting that the receptor recognises an intersubunit binding site [[cite:PUB00005996]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008983", "name" "Tumour necrosis factor-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01236" "TNFBETA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lymphotoxin-alpha", "short" "TNF_beta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 229, "taxa" 1062, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1918, "sets" 0, "proteins" 473, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 336}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002960", :literature {"PUB00006091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Fransen L" "Muller R" "Marmenout A" "Tavernier J" "Van der Heyden J" "Kawashima E" "Chollet A" "Tizard R" "Van Heuverswyn H" "Van Vliet A."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/13.12.4417", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Molecular cloning of mouse tumour necrosis factor cDNA and its eukaryotic expression.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "4417-29", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2989794}, "PUB00006095" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kriegler M" "Perez C" "DeFay K" "Albert I" "Lu SD."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(88)90486-2", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A novel form of TNF/cachectin is a cell surface cytotoxic transmembrane protein: ramifications for the complex physiology of TNF.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "45-53", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3349526}, "PUB00006101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sherry B" "Jue DM" "Zentella A" "Cerami A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
