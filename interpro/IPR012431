{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is found to carry modified motifs characteristic of PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease superfamily. These are the conserved Glu of motif I, the Asp surreounded by hydrophobics of motif II, EIKS of motif III, and the lysine of mmotif IV has migrated to an α-helix following the third core β-strand. The conserved patch of positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the motif IV apha-helix might be involved in substrate-binding or be contributing to active site formation [[cite:PUB00044133]]. Members with an additional N-terminal coi9led-coil domain, are annotated as tropomyosin, coiled-coil or microtubule binding proteins [[cite:PUB00016549], [cite:PUB00044133]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07788" "PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PD-(D/E)XK nuclease", "short" "PDDEXK_10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 877, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1075, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1075, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 925}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012431", :literature {"PUB00044133" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Knizewski L" "Kinch LN" "Grishin NV" "Rychlewski L" "Ginalski K."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Struct.
