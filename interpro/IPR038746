{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase was originally known as mechanosensory abnormality protein 17 (Mec-17), as it is the protein product of one of the 18 genes required for the development and function of the touch receptor neuron for gentle touch [[cite:PUB00053857]]. Mec-17 specifically acetylates 'Lys-40' in alpha-tubulin on the lumenal side of microtubules [[cite:PUB00064792]]. It is inefficient, and its activity is enhanced when tubulin is incorporated in microtubules [[cite:PUB00074837]]. It may affect microtubule stability and regulate microtubule dynamics. It can function as an enzymatic timer for microtubule lifetimes [[cite:PUB00088350]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4if5", "name" "Structure of human Mec17"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12327" "ALPHA-TUBULIN N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase", "short" "Atat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 882, "taxa" 3879, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2607, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1666}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
