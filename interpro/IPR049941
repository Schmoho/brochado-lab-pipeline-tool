{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of eukaryotic proteins, including human Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 7 (LPLAT 7) and Protein-serine O-palmitoleoyltransferase porcupine (PORCN).</p>\n\n<p>LPLAT 7 catalyses the transfer of an acyl group from an acyl-CoA to a lysophosphatidylinositol (1-acylglycerophosphatidylinositol or LPI) leading to the production of a phosphatidylinositol (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol or PI) and participates in the reacylation step of the phospholipid remodelling pathway also known as the Lands cycle [[cite:PUB00153360], [cite:PUB00153359]]. Alterations on its expression are associated to brain developmental disorders, fatty liver disease and hepatocellular and renal cancers. Its structure is mainly α-helical, with 11 transmembrane (TM) helical segments linked by short intervening helices (IH) and loops [[cite:PUB00153363]].</p>\n\n<p>PORCN acts as a key regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway by mediating the attachment of palmitoleate, a 16-carbon monounsaturated fatty acid (C16:1(9Z)), to Wnt proteins [[cite:PUB00153361]]. This protein shows a similar structural configuration to LPLAT7, with 11 TMs, 6 (IH) and 2 β-strands [[cite:PUB00153362]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13906" "PORCUPINE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 7/Porcupine-like", "short" "LPLAT_7/PORCN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2591, "taxa" 8928, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12630, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12630, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7952}, "pathways" 270}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
