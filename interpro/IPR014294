{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The bacterial core RNA polymerase complex, which consists of five subunits, is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. RNA polymerase recruits alternative sigma factors as a means of switching on specific regulons. Most bacteria express a multiplicity of sigma factors. Two of these factors, sigma-70 (gene rpoD), generally known as the major or primary sigma factor, and sigma-54 (gene rpoN or ntrA) direct the transcription of a wide variety of genes. The other sigma factors, known as alternative sigma factors, are required for the transcription of specific subsets of genes.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to sequence similarity, sigma factors can be grouped into two classes, the sigma-54 and sigma-70 families. Sequence alignments of the sigma70 family members reveal four conserved regions that can be further divided into subregions eg. sub-region 2.2, which may be involved in the binding of the sigma factor to the core RNA polymerase; and sub-region 4.2, which seems to harbor a DNA-binding 'helix-turn-helix' motif involved in binding the conserved -35 region of promoters recognised by the major sigma factors [[cite:PUB00004340], [cite:PUB00002181]].</p>\n\n<p>The plastids of higher plants originating from an ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont also contain sigma factors that are encoded by a small family of nuclear genes. All plastid sigma factors belong to the superfamily of sigmaA/sigma70 and have sequences homologous to the conserved regions 1.2, 2, 3, and 4 of bacterial sigma factors [[cite:PUB00088319]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents sigmaW, which is restricted to certain lineages of the order Bacillales.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02948" "RNA polymerase sigma factor SigW"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase sigma-W, bacillaceae", "short" "RNA_pol_sigma-W_bacilli"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 444, "taxa" 1169, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1014, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1014, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 826}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014294", :literature {"PUB00002181" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Lonetto M" "Gribskov M" "Gross CA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
