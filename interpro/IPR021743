{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The major structural proteins of mammalian hair are the hair keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) and the keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs). In the hair cortex, hair keratins are embedded in an inter-filamentous matrix consisting of KRTAPs which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft as a result of disulphide bonds between cysteine residues. There are essentially three groups of KRTAPs, viz: the high-sulphur (HS) and ultra-high-sulphur (UHS) KRTAPs (cysteine content: 16-30 and >30 mol%, respectively) and the high-glycine/tyrosine (HGT: 35-60 mol% glycine and tyrosine) KRTAPs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11759" "Keratin-associated matrix"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Keratin-associated protein, type8/19/20/21/22", "short" "KRTAP_type8/19/20/21/22"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 134, "taxa" 703, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 975, "sets" 0, "proteins" 958, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 665}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021743", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021743", "name" "Keratin-associated protein, type8/19/20/21/22", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR039351", "name" "Keratin-associated protein 8-1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR040313", "name" "Keratin-associated protein 6", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 665}}}
