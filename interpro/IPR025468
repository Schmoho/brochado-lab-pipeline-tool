{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TTRAP is a family of small bacterial proteins largely from Clostrium difficile. From comparative and other structural studies of the PDB:[pdbe:2L7K], [swissprot:Q18AW3], it has been suggested that this family is required for interacting with other proteins in order to facilitate the transfer of the transposon CTn4 between different bacterial species. PDB:[pdbe:2L7K] comprises an α-helical fold of four α-helices leading to the production of two clefts, the larger of which displays two highly conserved residues in close proximity, Glu-8 and Lys-48. The gene concerned is part of an operon within transposon CTn4, and is expressed alongside a putative DNA primase, a DNA topoisomerase and conjugal transfer proteins [[cite:PUB00075684]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR041965", "name" "Putative transposon-transfer assisting superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14203" "Putative transposon-transfer assisting protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative transposon-transfer assisting protein", "short" "TTRAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 227, "taxa" 888, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1695, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1695, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1443}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025468", :literature {"PUB00075684" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Pulavarti SV" "Eletsky A" "Lee HW" "Acton TB" "Xiao R" "Everett JK" "Prestegard JH" "Montelione GT" "Szyperski T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
