{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These enzymes are involved in nitrate assimilation in the denitrification pathway. The 3D structure of the copper-containing nitrite reductase (NIR) from Achromobacter cycloclastes has been determined to 2.3A resolution [[cite:PUB00005146]]. The enzyme is a trimer, each monomer of which contains two Greek key Î²-barrel domains (similar to that of plastocyanin) and houses two copper sites. The two copper atoms in the monomer comprise a type I copper site (Cu-I: two His, one Cys and one Met ligand) that plays a crucial role for electron transfer from pseudoazurin to the type II copper site (Cu-II: three His and one solvent ligand), the catalytic centre of NIR for the reduction of nitrite. The Cu-II site lies at the bottom of a 12A deep solvent channel and is the site to which the substrate (NO2-) binds [[cite:PUB00005146]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1zv2", "name" "Cu-containing nitrite reductase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02376" "nitrite reductase, copper-containing"}, "prints" {"PR00695" "CUNO2RDTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrite reductase, copper-type", "short" "NO2-reductase_Cu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 270, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1724, "taxa" 7600, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19174, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8125, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6416}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
