{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of vesicle-associated membrane-protein-associated proteins (VAPs) and plant VAP homologs (PVAPs) [[cite:PUB00071999]]. VAPs (VAPA and VAPB in humans, VAPA, VAPB and VAPC in other mammals [[cite:PUB00018205]]) are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins that play roles in vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter release, microtubule organisation, lipid transport and unfolded protein response [[cite:PUB00071993]]. VAP proteins contain an MSP domain in their N-terminal half, which has been shown to interact with proteins containing a FFAT motif, such as members of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family or the phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins from the PITPNM family [[cite:PUB00071993]]. Yeast VAP homologues are known as Scs2 and Scs22 [[cite:PUB00072001]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8hs7", "name" "Crystal structure of Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein SCS2 from yeast"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10809" "VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019693" "VAMP-associated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesicle-associated membrane-protein-associated protein", "short" "VAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2606, "taxa" 8872, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12025, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11922, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7519}, "pathways" 41}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
