Later, the Tab2 homologue from Arabidopsis was found involved in the signalling pathway of light-controlled synthesis of photosystem proteins during early plant development, that probably functions as an activator of translation with targets at PSI and PSII [[cite:PUB00083887], [cite:PUB00098288]].
