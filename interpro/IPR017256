{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Biological oxidation of methane to methanol by aerobic bacteria is catalysed by two different enzymes, the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and the membrane-bound or particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). This entry represents MmoD, a component and a regulator of the sMMO [[cite:PUB00074188], [cite:PUB00032461]]. sMMO is only expressed at very low copper:biomass ratios, while pMMO expression increases as this ratio increases. The copper switch that controlling the expression of these two MMOs is regulated by MmoD and methanobactin [[cite:PUB00074189]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04550" "soluble methane monooxygenase-binding protein MmoD"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037664" "Methane monooxygenase, component D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methane monooxygenase component D", "short" "MmoD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 15, "taxa" 82, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 52, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 50}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017256", :literature {"PUB00074188" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Merkx M" "Lippard SJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
