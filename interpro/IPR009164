{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase catalyses the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate [[cite:PUB00000179]]. This is an essential reaction in the process of gluconeogenesis, the process by which non-carbohydrate precursors are converted to glucose, and hence this enzyme is found almost universally. Enzyme activity can be regulated by a number of different mechanisms including AMP inhibition, cylic AMP-dependent phosphorylation and light-dependent-activation.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the class 3 fructose 1,6-bisphosphatases [[cite:PUB00068782]]. The Bacillus subtilis enzyme is inhibited by AMP, though this can be overcome by phosphoenolpyruvate, and is dependent on Mn(2+) [[cite:PUB00035738], [cite:PUB00012889]]. Mutants lacking this enzyme are apparently still able to grow on gluconeogenic growth substrates such as malate and glycerol.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01854" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase class 3 [fbp]"}, "pfam" {"PF06874" "Firmicute fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000906" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Bacillus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase class 3", "short" "FBPtase_class3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 952, "taxa" 4178, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4523, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4519, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3407}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
