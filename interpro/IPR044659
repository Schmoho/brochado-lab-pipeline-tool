{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes protein PELPK1/2 from Arabidopsis thaliana and similar sequences predominantly found in plants. PELPK2 is a presumptive inparalog of PELPK1 (also known as Proline-rich protein 10, At5g09530), a positive regulator of germination and plant growth. They contain 36 repeats of a unique pentapeptide (Pro-Glu-Leu|Ile|Val-Pro-Lys), named the PELPK motif [[cite:PUB00096733]], which is also found in proteins from many other angiosperms. Members of this family localized to the cell wall, being part part of the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) super-family of cell wall proteins [[cite:PUB00096734]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes some uncharacterised proteins from bacteria, animals and fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33088" "MUCIN-2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein PELPK1/2", "short" "PELPK1_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1261, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1921, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1921, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1143}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044659", :literature {"PUB00096733" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Rashid A" "Deyholos MK."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Rep", "title" "PELPK1 (At5g09530) contains a unique pentapeptide repeat and is a positive regulator of germination in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1735-45", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21559969}, "PUB00096734" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Rashid A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol (Mosk)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol (Mosk)", "title" "[Sub-celluiar localization of PELPK1 in Arabidopsis thaliana as determined by translational fusion with green fluorescent protein reporter].", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "300-5", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25850299}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044659", "name" "Protein PELPK1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
