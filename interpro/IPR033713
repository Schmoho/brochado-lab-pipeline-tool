{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NudJ is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. Unlike the other Nudix nucleoside triphosphatases, the product of the reaction catalyzed by NudJ is phosphate instead of pyrophosphate. NudJ hydrolyses 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) to 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P), and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) to thiamine monophosphate (TMP). Other substrates are hydrolysed, such as MeO-HMP-PP, CF(3)-HMP-PP, MeO-TPP, and nucleoside tri- and diphosphates.  A magnesium ion is required as a co-factor [[cite:PUB00043005], [cite:PUB00053972]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2b0v", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase from Nitrosomonas europaea."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03675" "uncharacterized NUDIX hydrolase subfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatase NudJ", "short" "NudJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1104, "taxa" 5432, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6005, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6005, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4614}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
