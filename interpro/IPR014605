{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents signal transduction response regulators with a C-terminal receiver domain, such as PhyR, which is found in the Alphaproteobacterium Methylobacterium extorquens (Protomonas extorquens). PhyR is a key regulator for adaptation to epiphytic life (leaf colonising) of the bacterium, and is essential for plant colonisation, possibly due to its suggested involvement in the regulation of a number of stress proteins [[cite:PUB00042903]]. PhyR proteins have a structure consisting of two domains; a predicted amino-terminal extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor-like domain and a carboxy-terminal receiver domain [[cite:PUB00042904]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n0r", "name" "Structure of the PhyR stress response regulator at 1.25 Angstrom resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036400" "Predicted response regulator with C-terminal receiver domain, Alphaproteobacteria type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Signal transduction response regulator PhyR-like, alphaproteobacteria", "short" "Sig_resp-reg_PhyR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1055, "taxa" 3196, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3120, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3118, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2580}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014605", :literature {"PUB00042904" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gourion B" "Francez-Charlot A" "Vorholt JA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
