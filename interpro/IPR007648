{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ATP synthase inhibitor prevents the enzyme from switching to ATP hydrolysis during collapse of the electrochemical gradient, for example during oxygen deprivation [[cite:PUB00019733]] ATP synthase inhibitor forms a one to one complex with the F1 ATPase, possibly by binding at the α-β interface. It is thought to inhibit ATP synthesis by preventing the release of ATP [[cite:PUB00010058]]. The minimum inhibitory region for bovine inhibitor ([swissprot:P01096]) is from residues 39 to 72 [[cite:PUB00010058]]. The inhibitor has two oligomeric states, dimer (the active state) and tetramer. At low pH , the inhibitor forms a dimer via antiparallel coiled coil interactions between the C-terminal regions of two monomers. At high pH, the inhibitor forms tetramers and higher oligomers by coiled coil interactions involving the N terminus and inhibitory region, thus preventing the inhibitory activity [[cite:PUB00019733]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7dtl", "name" "Crystal structure of PSK, an antimicrobial peptide from Chrysomya megacephala"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04568" "Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, IATP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor", "short" "ATPase_inhibitor_mt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 48, "proteomes" 2011, "taxa" 6847, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3742, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3731, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2416}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007648", :literature {"PUB00010058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["van Raaij MJ" "Orriss GL" "Montgomery MG" "Runswick MJ" "Fearnley IM" "Skehel JM" "Walker JE."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi960628f", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "The ATPase inhibitor protein from bovine heart mitochondria: the minimal inhibitory sequence.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "15618-25", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8961923}, "PUB00019733" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Cabezon E" "Butler PJ" "Runswick MJ" "Carbajo RJ" "Walker JE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
