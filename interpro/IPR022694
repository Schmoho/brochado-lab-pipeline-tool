{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.35]) (HCDH) [[cite:PUB00004646]] is an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism and catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-oxoacyl-CoA. Most eukaryotic cells have two fatty-acid beta-oxidation systems, one located in mitochondria and the other in peroxisomes. In peroxisomes 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase forms, with enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) and 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) a multifunctional enzyme where the N-terminal domain bears the hydratase/isomerase activities and the C-terminal domain the dehydrogenase activity. There are two mitochondrial enzymes: one which is monofunctional and the other which is, like its peroxisomal counterpart, multifunctional.</p>\r\n<p>In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA) HCDH is part of a multifunctional enzyme which also contains an ECH/ECI domain as well as a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase domain [[cite:PUB00004380]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4om8", "name" "Crystal structure of 5-formly-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine 4-carboxylic acid (FHMPC) 5-dehydrogenase, an NAD+ dependent dismutase."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000105" "3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase", "short" "3-OHacyl-CoA_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 39, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8002, "taxa" 28474, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45445, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44834, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33958}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
