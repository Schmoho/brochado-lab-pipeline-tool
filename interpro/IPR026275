{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein familiy consists of glyoxalases, bleomycin/phenazine resistance proteins, and dioxygenases. It includes phenazine resistance protein EhpR. In Enterobacter agglomerans, EhpR confers resistance by binding D-alanyl-griseoluteic acid and acting as a chaperone involved in exporting the antibiotic rather than by altering it chemically. EhpR is evolutionarily related to glyoxalase I and type I extradiol dioxygenases [[cite:PUB00085703], [cite:PUB00056402]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3sk2", "name" "Crystal structure of phenazine resistance protein EhpR from Enterobacter agglomerans (Erwinia herbicola, Pantoea agglomerans) Eh1087 in complex with griseoluteic acid"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF039020" "Phenazine resistance protein, EhpR type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glyoxalase/dioxygenase/EhpR", "short" "Glyoxalase/dOase/EhpR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 465, "taxa" 2569, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2265, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2265, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1778}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026275", :literature {"PUB00056402" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yu S" "Vit A" "Devenish S" "Mahanty HK" "Itzen A" "Goody RS" "Blankenfeldt W."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Struct.
