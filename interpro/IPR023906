{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family of small proteins, approximately 100 amino acids in length, lack of homology to any known enzymes. Family members possess a distinctive C-terminal region motif, with the common modification target residue Cys flanked by sterically permissive Gly residues. They co-occur with a subfamily of radical SAM proteins in several species of Halobacteria and Bacillus. Since the radical SAM proteins belong to a branch in which most characterised members act on peptide substrates, it possible that this family is a radical SAM target.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03995" "CGCGG family rSAM-modified RiPP protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radical SAM target protein, putative", "short" "rSAM_target_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 91, "taxa" 465, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 341, "sets" 0, "proteins" 341, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 285}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023906", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023906", "name" "Radical SAM target protein, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
