{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GTP cyclohydrolase II (also known as ribA) catalyses the first committed step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin b2). The enzyme converts GTP to 2,5-diamino-6-beta-ribosyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate (APy), formate and pyrophosphate, and requires magnesium as a cofactor. In numerous bacteria and in plants, GTP cyclohydrolase II occurs in the C-terminal of a bifunctional enzyme known as ribBA, which also comprises an N-terminal 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (DHBP_synthase, also known as RibB) ([interpro:IPR000422]).
