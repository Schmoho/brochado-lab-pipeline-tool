{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 7 (FXYD7) and similar proteins from vertebrates. FXYD7 has a potential splice variant with an additional 3 residues. In rats, expression of FXYD7 was restricted to the brain, with highest levels in the cerebrum, followed by brainstem, and hippocampus, and relatively weak expression in the hypothalamus. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization with synaptophysin and modest colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein, indicating predominant expression in neurons and lower expression in astroglial cells [[cite:PUB00102460], [cite:PUB00018052], [cite:PUB00102453]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20325" "FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 7", "short" "FXYD7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 124, "taxa" 669, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 249, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 142}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047284", :literature {"PUB00018052" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sweadner KJ" "Rael E."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.2000.6274", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "The FXYD gene family of small ion transport regulators or channels: cDNA sequence, protein signature sequence, and expression.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "41-56", "volume" "68", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10950925}, "PUB00102453" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Geering K."], "ISO_journal" "Am J Physiol Renal Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Am J Physiol Renal Physiol", "title" "FXYD proteins: new regulators of Na-K-ATPase.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "F241-50", "volume" "290", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16403837}, "PUB00102460" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Beguin P" "Crambert G" "Monnet-Tschudi F" "Uldry M" "Horisberger JD" "Garty H" "Geering K."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "FXYD7 is a brain-specific regulator of Na,K-ATPase alpha 1-beta isozymes.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "3264-73", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12093728}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000272", "name" "Ion-transport regulator, FXYD family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR047281", "name" "Phospholemman", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047282", "name" "Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit gamma", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047283", "name" "FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 4", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047284", "name" "FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 7", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
