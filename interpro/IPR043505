{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Nucleocapsid (N) protein is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein also implicated in viral genome replication and in modulating cell signalling pathways. The N protein interacts with genomic and subgenomic RNA molecules. Together with the envelope protein M, it participates in genome condensation and packaging. The N protein is a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [[cite:PUB00094096], [cite:PUB00094095], [cite:PUB00094098], [cite:PUB00094097], [cite:PUB00099891]].</p>\n\n<p>Coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid (N) proteins have 3 highly conserved domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) (N1b), the C-terminal domain (CTD)(N2b) and the N3 region. The N1b and N2b domains from SARS CoV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human CoV 229E and mouse hepatic virus (MHV) display similar topological organisations. N proteins form dimers, which are asymmetrically arranged into octamers via their N2b domains.</p>\n\n<p>Domains N1b and N2b are linked by another domain N2a that contains an SR-rich region (rich in serine and arginine residues). A priming phosphorylation of specific serine residues by an as yet unknown kinase, triggers the subsequent phosphorylation by the host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) of several residues in the SR-rich region. This phosphorylation allows the N protein to associate with the RNA helicase DDX1 permitting template read-through, and enabling the transition from discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) to continuous synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and genomic RNA (gRNA). Production of gRNA in the presence of N oligomers may promote the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and the newly transcribed sgmRNA would guarantee efficient synthesis of structural proteins [[cite:PUB00094055], [cite:PUB00094059], [cite:PUB00094060]].</p>\n\n<p>It has been shown that N proteins interact with nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) and thus are recruited to the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs). In MHV, the N1b and N2a domains mediate the binding to NSP3 in a gRNA-independent manner. At the RTCs, the N protein is required for the stimulation of gRNA replication and sgmRNA transcription. It remains unclear, however, how and why the N protein orchestrates viral RNA synthesis. The cytoplasmic N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of NSP3 and the SR-rich region of the N2a domain of the N protein may be important for this interaction. The direct association of N protein with RTCs is a critical step for MHV infection [[cite:PUB00094055]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the nucleocapsid protein from Betacoronavirus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04096" "Nucleoprotein [N]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleocapsid protein, betacoronavirus", "short" "NCAP_bCoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 279, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1089, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1089, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043505", :literature {"PUB00099891" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zinzula L" "Basquin J" "Bohn S" "Beck F" "Klumpe S" "Pfeifer G" "Nagy I" "Bracher A" "Hartl FU" "Baumeister W."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "High-resolution structure and biophysical characterization of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein dimerization domain from the Covid-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "54-62", "volume" "538", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33039147}, "PUB00094059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cong Y" "Kriegenburg F" "de Haan CAM" "Reggiori F."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins assemble constitutively in high molecular oligomers.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "5740", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28720894}, "PUB00094060" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wu CH" "Chen PJ" "Yeh SH."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "Nucleocapsid phosphorylation and RNA helicase DDX1 recruitment enables coronavirus transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "462-72", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25299332}, "PUB00094055" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Cong Y" "Ulasli M" "Schepers H" "Mauthe M" "V'kovski P" "Kriegenburg F" "Thiel V" "de Haan CAM" "Reggiori F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
