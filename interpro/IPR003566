{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The egg peptide speract receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein of about 500 amino acids [[cite:PUB00004674]]. Topologically, it comprises a large extracellular domain of about 450 residues, followed by a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic region of about 12 amino acids. The extracellular domain contains 4 repeats of a well-conserved region, which spans 115 amino acids and contains 6 conserved cysteines. A similar domain is also found towards the C terminus of macrophage scavenger receptor type I [[cite:PUB00004717]], a membrane glycoprotein implicated in the pathologic deposition of cholesterol in arterial walls during artherogenesis, and in the CD5 glycoprotein, which acts as a receptor in regulating T-cell proliferation.<p>The T1/Leu-1/CD5 glycoprotein is expressed at the surface membrane of all mature T cells. It has been implicated both in the proliferative response of activated T cells and in T-cell helper function [[cite:PUB00006625]]. The complete amino-acid sequence of the T1 precursor has been deduced from cDNA clones. The protein contains a classical signal peptide; a 347-residue extracellular segment; a transmembrane region; and a 93-residue intra- cellular segment [[cite:PUB00006625]]. The extracellular region contains several cysteine residues and comprises 2 speract receptor domains separated by a proline/ threonine-rich region [[cite:PUB00006625]]. CD5 has been shown to function as a receptor, delivering co-stimulatory signals to T-cells, interacting specifically with the cell-surface protein CD72 (Lyb-2 in mice) exclusive to B-cells [[cite:PUB00006634]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47309" "T-CELL SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN CD5"}, "prints" {"PR01409" "TCELLCD5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5", "short" "Tcell_CD5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 368, "taxa" 1473, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 776, "sets" 0, "proteins" 607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 366}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003566", :literature {"PUB00004674" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Dangott LJ" "Jordan JE" "Bellet RA" "Garbers DL."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
