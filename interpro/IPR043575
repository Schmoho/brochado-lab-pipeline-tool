{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP; also known as hepatocyte growth factor-like protein) and its close relative hepatocyte growth factor ([pirsf:PIRSF500183]) are non-peptidase homologues belonging to MEROPS peptidase family S1 (chymotrypsin family, clan PA(S)), subfamily S1A.</p>\n\n<p>MSP is a plasma protein that is secreted from the liver into the circulation as a single-chain, biologically inactive pro-protein. Proteolytic cleavage at a single site yields the active molecule composed of disulphide-linked alpha and beta chains. The MSP receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase found in murine resident peritoneal macrophages but not exudate macrophages or blood monocytes. MSP induces phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic domain, association of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase with the receptor, and phosphorylation of receptor-bound PI-3 kinase. MSP may function in tissue injury or wound healing [[cite:PUB00027859]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500185" "Macrophage stimulating protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Macrophage stimulating protein", "short" "MSP_HGFL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 79, "taxa" 324, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 125, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 79}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043575", :literature {"PUB00027859" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Leonard EJ."], "ISO_journal" "Ciba Found.
