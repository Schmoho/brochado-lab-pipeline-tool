{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trypanothione reductase from Leishmania, and African and South American trypanosomes, has been purified and characterised [[cite:PUB00003614]]. The enzymes have similar physical, mechanistic and kinetic properties, and are members of the flavoprotein disulphide oxidoreductase family. Trypanothione is the parasite analogue of glutathione, hence this enzyme is equivalent to glutathione reductase. It catalyses the reaction:</p>\r\n<reaction>NADPH + trypanothione = NADP(+) + reduced trypanothione</reaction>\r\n<p>Trypanothione reductase shows pronounced specificty for its disulphide substrates, trypanothione disulphide or glutathionylspermidine disulphide. The 3D structure of the enzyme has been determined and its mode of substrate binding revealed in detail [[cite:PUB00004988]], offering hope for the design of drugs to combat Chagas disease. The structure belongs to the α+β class, i.e. with mainly anti-parallel β-sheets separated by alpha and beta regions. It contains an α-β sandwich characteristic of FAD/NAD-linked reductases and a C-terminal dimerisation domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fec", "name" "UNLIGANDED CRITHIDIA FASCICULATA TRYPANOTHIONE REDUCTASE AT 1.7 ANGSTROM RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00470" "Trypanothione reductase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01423" "trypanothione-disulfide reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trypanothione reductase", "short" "Trypnth_redctse"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 56, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 241, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 195, "sets" 0, "proteins" 136, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 117}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
