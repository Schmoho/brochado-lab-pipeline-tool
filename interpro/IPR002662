{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a birnavirus, is an important pathogen in fish farms. Analyses of viral proteins showed that VP2 is the major structural and immunogenic polypeptide of the virus [[cite:PUB00005611], [cite:PUB00043618]]. All neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are specific to VP2 and bind to continuous or discontinuous epitopes. The variable domain of VP2 and the 20 adjacent amino acids of the conserved C-terminal are probably the most important in inducing an immune response for the protection of animals [[cite:PUB00005611]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The large RNA segment of the Birnaviridae codes for a polyprotein (N-VP2-VP4-VP3-C), most of which is then processed to generate the constituent polypeptides.
