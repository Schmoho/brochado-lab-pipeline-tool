{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes the Histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins 1-5 (AHP1-5) from Arabidopsis thaliana and the phosphorelay intermediate protein YPD1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. Members of this entry are predominantly found in plants and fungi.</p>\n\n<p>The phospho-relay system is a variant of the two-component signal transduction system. Here a hybrid sensor histidine kinase (HK) auto-phosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to an internal receiver domain, rather than to a separate response regulator (RR) protein. The phosphoryl group is then shuttled to histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) and subsequently to a terminal RR, which can evoke the desired response [[cite:PUB00042806], [cite:PUB00042807]]. AHP1-5 functions as two-component phosphorelay mediators between cytokinin sensor histidine kinases and response regulators. These proteins play an important role in propagating cytokinin signal transduction through the multistep phosphorelay, thus in the development of female gametophytes. They are localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus [[cite:PUB00099157], [cite:PUB00099160], [cite:PUB00099158]].</p>\n\n<p>The phosphorelay intermediate protein YPD1 is part of the two-component regulatory system which controls gene expression in response to changes in the osmolarity of the extracellular environment. It catalyses the phosphoryl group transfer from the membrane-bound osmosensing histidine kinase SLN1 to two distinct response regulator proteins, SSK1 in the cytoplasm, and transcription factor SKN7 in the nucleus [[cite:PUB00099156], [cite:PUB00099159], [cite:PUB00099155]]. In C. albicans, this system is studied as a potential target for antifungal drugs [[cite:PUB00099161]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yvi", "name" "X-RAY STRUCTURE OF PUTATIVE HISTIDINE-CONTAINING PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN FROM RICE, AK104879"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036641", "name" "HPT domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28242" "PHOSPHORELAY INTERMEDIATE PROTEIN YPD1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 1-5/Phosphorelay intermediate protein YPD1", "short" "AHP1-5/YPD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1487, "taxa" 4963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6534, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6534, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3975}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045871", :literature {"PUB00099161" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Liao B" "Ye X" "Chen X" "Zhou Y" "Cheng L" "Zhou X" "Ren B."], "ISO_journal" "Virulence", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virulence", "title" "The two-component signal transduction system and its regulation in <i>Candida albicans</i>.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "1884-1899", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34233595}, "PUB00042806" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Varughese KI."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
