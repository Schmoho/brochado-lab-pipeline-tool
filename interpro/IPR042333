{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The his entry includes Low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing protein 2 from human (LDLRAD2), whose function is unknown and Mig-13 (also known as abnormal cell migration protein 13) from C. elegans. Mig-13 is probably a receptor that acts as an upstream signalling protein to promote the guidance, migration and positioning of the right Q neuroblast (QR) and its descendants along the anteroposterior body axis, and also the anterior migration of BDU interneurons during larval development [[cite:PUB00155142], [cite:PUB00155143], [cite:PUB00086577]]. It is involved in cytoskeleton dynamics regulating the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge of migrating cells to ensure correct Q cell polarity and promote migration [[cite:PUB00155143], [cite:PUB00086577]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24652" "LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR CLASS A DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LRAD2/Mig-13-like", "short" "LRAD2/Mig-13-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 531, "taxa" 2551, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2177, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1163}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042333", :literature {"PUB00155143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "27", "authors" ["Wang X" "Zhou F" "Lv S" "Yi P" "Zhu Z" "Yang Y" "Feng G" "Li W" "Ou G."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1301849110", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Transmembrane protein MIG-13 links the Wnt signaling and Hox genes to the cell polarity in neuronal migration.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "11175-80", "volume" "110", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23784779}, "PUB00155142" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Masuda H" "Nakamura K" "Takata N" "Itoh B" "Hirose T" "Moribe H" "Mekada E" "Okada M."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.01.031", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "MIG-13 controls anteroposterior cell migration by interacting with UNC-71/ADM-1 and SRC-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "740-6", "volume" "586", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22293500}, "PUB00086577" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhu Z" "Chai Y" "Jiang Y" "Li W" "Hu H" "Li W" "Wu JW" "Wang ZX" "Huang S" "Ou G."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
