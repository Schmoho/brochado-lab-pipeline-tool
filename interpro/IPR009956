{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of several Enterobacterial post-segregation antitoxin CcdA proteins. The F plasmid-carried bacterial toxin, the CcdB protein, is known to act on DNA gyrase in two different ways. CcdB poisons the gyrase-DNA complex, blocking the passage of polymerases and leading to double-strand breakage of the DNA. Alternatively, in cells that overexpress CcdB, the A subunit of DNA gyrase (GyrA) has been found as an inactive complex with CcdB. Both poisoning and inactivation can be prevented and reversed in the presence of the F plasmid-encoded antidote, the CcdA protein [[cite:PUB00013116]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hpw", "name" "CcdB dimer in complex with one C-terminal CcdA domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07362" "Post-segregation antitoxin CcdA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Post-segregation antitoxin CcdA", "short" "Post-segregation_anti-tox_CcdA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 824, "taxa" 4785, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4766, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4766, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3808}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0321", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0321"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009956", :literature {"PUB00013116" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Bahassi EM" "O'Dea MH" "Allali N" "Messens J" "Gellert M" "Couturier M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
