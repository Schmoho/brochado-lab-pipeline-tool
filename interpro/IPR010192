{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the enzyme O-succinylbenzoate-CoA ligase (MenE), which is involved in the fourth step of the menaquinone (vitamin K2) biosynthesis pathway. In bacteria, menaquinone is used during fumarate reduction in anaerobic respiration. In green sulphur bacteria and heliobacteria, menaquinones are thought to be used as a loosely bound secondary electron acceptor in the photosynthetic reaction centre. In cyanobacteria, the product of the menaquinone pathway is phylloquinone (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), a molecule used exclusively as an electron transfer cofactor in Photosystem (PS) I [[cite:PUB00014943]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nj0", "name" "Wild-type E. coli MenE with bound m phenylether-linked analogue of OSB-AMS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00731" "2-succinylbenzoate--CoA ligase [menE]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01923" "o-succinylbenzoate--CoA ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-succinylbenzoate--CoA ligase", "short" "MenE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 882, "taxa" 4719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5156, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5156, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3831}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1560", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1560"} {"accession" "GenProp0058", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0058"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
