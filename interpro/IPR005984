{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phospholamban (PLB) is a small protein (52 amino acids) that regulates the affinity of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) for calcium. PLB is present in cardiac myocytes, in slow-twitch and smooth muscle and is expressed also in aorta endothelial cells in which it could play a role in tissue relaxation. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of phospholamban removes and restores, respectively, its inhibitory activity on SERCA2a. It has in fact been shown that phospholamban, in its non-phosphorylated form, binds to SERCA2a and inhibits this pump by lowering its affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the phosphorylated form does not exert the inhibition. PLB is phosphorylated at two sites, namely at Ser-16 for a\ncAMP-dependent phosphokinase and at Thr-17 for a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent phosphokinase, phosphorylation at Ser-16 being a prerequisite for the phosphorylation at Thr-17.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6y40", "name" "14-3-3 Sigma in complex with phosphorylated PLN peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20250" "Phospholamban bioactive peptide and similar proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF04272" "Phospholamban"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01294" "phospholamban"}, "panther" {"PTHR21194" "CARDIAC PHOSPHOLAMBAN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001665" "Cardiac phospholamban"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phospholamban", "short" "PLB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 537, "taxa" 1880, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 658, "sets" 0, "proteins" 658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 514}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005984", :literature {"PUB00007919" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pollesello P" "Annila A."], "ISO_journal" "Biophys.
