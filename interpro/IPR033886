{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) catalyzes the oxidation of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate. This is the fourth step and the only redox reaction in the de novo biosynthesis of UMP, the precursor of all pyrimidine nucleotides. DHOD requires FMN as co-factor. DHOD is divided into class 1 and class 2 based on their amino acid sequences and cellular location. Members of class 1 are cytosolic enzymes and multimers, while class 2 enzymes are membrane associated and monomeric. The class 1 enzymes can be further divided into subtypes 1A and 1B which are homodimers and heterotetrameric proteins, respectively [[cite:PUB00081555], [cite:PUB00081556], [cite:PUB00021942]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents class 1A.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jub", "name" "The K136E mutant of lactococcus lactis dihydroorotate dehydrogenase A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04741" "DHOD_1A_like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, class 1A", "short" "DHOD_1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 89, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 591, "taxa" 2462, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1924, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1924, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1391}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
