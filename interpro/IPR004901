In Arabidopsis thaliana the RGP protein family consists of five closely related members, three of which have been identified as UDP-arabinopyranose mutases that catalyze the formation of UDP-L-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) from UDP-Larabinopyranose (UDP-Arap). This interconversion is essential for cell wall establishment and plant development [[cite:PUB00087322]].</p>.", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016429" "Alpha-1,4-glucan-protein synthase [UDP-forming]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Reversibly glycosylated polypeptide", "short" "RGP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1031, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1745, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1715, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1053}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
