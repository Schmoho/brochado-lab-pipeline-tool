{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of proteins found in Pseudomonas, including esterases EstA and EstP. EstA is required for rhamnolipid production, all kinds of cell motility (swimming, swarming, and twitching), and biofilm formation, however, the exact role of EstA in these processes is unclear [[cite:PUB00151420]]. EstA and EstP have esterase activity towards p-nitrophenyl esters of short acyl chain length (C4-C6) and Tween detergents. They also show relatively high activity towards beta-naphthyl butyrate, whereas its activities towards triacylglycerols and acyls-CoA are negligible [[cite:PUB00086986]]. These protein consist of an N-terminal domain with catalytic activity and a C-terminal autotransporter domain [[cite:PUB00086986], [cite:PUB00061585]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041609" "esterase EstP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Esterase EstA/EstP", "short" "Esterase_EstP/EstA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 443, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 655, "sets" 0, "proteins" 655, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 498}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
