{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of defensin-like proteins from plants. Plant genomes contain several hundred defensin-like (DEFL) genes that encode short cysteine-rich proteins resembling defensins, which are known antimicrobial polypeptides [[cite:PUB00092658]]. Arabidopsis thaliana has more than 300 DEFL genes, and they are likely to be involved in both natural immunity and cell-to-cell communication, including pollen-pistil interactions [[cite:PUB00092659]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF25052" "Defensin-like family", "PF07333" "S locus-related glycoprotein 1 binding pollen coat protein (SLR1-BP)"}, "panther" {"PTHR33830" "DEFENSIN-LIKE PROTEIN 184-RELATED", "PTHR34783" "DEFENSIN-LIKE PROTEIN 144-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Defensin-like protein", "short" "DEFL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 29, "proteomes" 186, "taxa" 778, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2360, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1588}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010851", :literature {"PUB00092658" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Tesfaye M" "Silverstein KA" "Nallu S" "Wang L" "Botanga CJ" "Gomez SK" "Costa LM" "Harrison MJ" "Samac DA" "Glazebrook J" "Katagiri F" "Gutierrez-Marcos JF" "Vandenbosch KA."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058992", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Spatio-temporal expression patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula defensin-like genes.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e58992", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23527067}, "PUB00092659" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Takeuchi H" "Higashiyama T."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001449", "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "A species-specific cluster of defensin-like genes encodes diffusible pollen tube attractants in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e1001449", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23271953}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010851", "name" "Defensin-like protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 774}}}
