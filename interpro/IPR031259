{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and cellular retinoic-acid-binding proteins (CRBPs) are part of the intracellular-lipid-binding proteins (iLBPs) family [[cite:PUB00075200]].</p>\n\n<p>The primary role of all the FABP members is regulation of fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport [[cite:PUB00075180]]. To date, nine FABPs have been identified in mammals, each showing specific tissue distribution patterns and ligand preference. All FABP members have a similar β-barrel structure; fatty acid ligands are accommodated in the central cavity of the β-barrel, which dramatically increases their solubility in the aqueous cytoplasm, facilitating their movement to target sites [[cite:PUB00075180], [cite:PUB00075187]].</p>\n\n<p>Retinoic-acid-binding proteins (CRBPs) are specific for vitamin A derivatives and can be classified into the cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABP-I and II) and the cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBP-I, II, III, and IV) [[cite:PUB00075199]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7oxx", "name" "CrabP2 mutant R30AK31A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012674", "name" "Calycin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11955" "FATTY ACID BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intracellular lipid binding protein", "short" "ILBP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 718, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1039, "taxa" 4442, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17137, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17137, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11948}, "pathways" 59}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031259", :literature {"PUB00075200" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Schaap FG" "van der Vusse GJ" "Glatz JF."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
