{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from tailed bacteriophages and bacterial prophages mainly found in proteobacteria, including LysC from Burkholderia phage ST79 (Bacteriophage ST79) ([swissprot:R4JDL9]). LysC is an Rz1-like component of a phage lytic system, substantially overlapping although not fully embedded in the gene for the Rz-like LysB component. The phage lysis defect in the absence of a functional LysB/LysC system appears in the presence of high concentrations of divalent cations [[cite:PUB00105751]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038368" "Rz1-like lysis system protein LysC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rz1-like lysis system protein LysC", "short" "LysC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 825, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1001, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1001, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 664}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047737", :literature {"PUB00105751" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Khakhum N" "Yordpratum U" "Boonmee A" "Tattawasart U" "Rodrigues JL" "Sermswan RW."], "ISO_journal" "J Appl Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Appl Microbiol", "title" "Identification of the Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteriophage ST79 lysis gene cassette.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "364-72", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27038077}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047737", "name" "Rz1-like lysis system protein LysC", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
