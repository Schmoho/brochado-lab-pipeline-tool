LptC is involved in lipopolysaccharide-assembly on the outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms [[cite:PUB00053165]]. The lipopolysaccharide component of the outer bacterial membrane is transported form its source of origin to the outer membrane by a set of proteins constituting a transport machinery that is made up of LptA, LptB, LptC, LptD, LptE.
