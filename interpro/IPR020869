Rrp42 is a member of the RNase_PH family, named after the bacterial Ribonuclease PH, a 3'-5' exoribonuclease. Structurally all members of this family form hexameric rings (trimers of dimers). In archaea, the ring is formed by three Rrp41:Rrp42 dimers. The central chamber within the ring contains three phosphorolytic active sites located in an Rrp41 pocket at the interface between Rrp42 and Rrp41. The ring is capped by three copies of Rrp4 and/or Csl4 which contain putative RNA interaction domains [[cite:PUB00074104], [cite:PUB00074089]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2je6", "name" "Structure of a 9-subunit archaeal exosome"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027408", "name" "PNPase/RNase PH domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR020568", "name" "Ribosomal protein uS5 domain 2-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11365" "RRP42 subunit of archaeal exosome"}, "hamap" {"MF_00622" "Exosome complex component Rrp42 [rrp42]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosome complex component Rrp42, archaea", "short" "Rrp42_archaea"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 151, "taxa" 1338, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1795, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1551}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020869", :literature {"PUB00074088" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Evguenieva-Hackenberg E."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
