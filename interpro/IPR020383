{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents MinK-related peptide, potassium channel accessory subunit protein 4 from Caenorhabditis elegans (MPS4) and similar proteins  found in nematodes. MinK-related peptides (MiRPs or KCNEs) are single-transmembrane proteins that associate with pore-forming ion-channel sub-units to form stable complexes with channel properties markedly distinct from those of the isolated pore-forming sub-units [[cite:PUB00085263]]. MPS4 is expressed exclusively in the C. elegans nervous system and is essential for neuronal excitability [[cite:PUB00085264]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17523" "MinK-related peptide, potassium channel accessory sub-unit protein 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MinK-related peptide, potassium channel accessory subunit protein 4", "short" "MPS4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 22, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020383", :literature {"PUB00085263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Bianchi L" "Kwok SM" "Driscoll M" "Sesti F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
