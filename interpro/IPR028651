{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of chromatin modification proteins are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Members are found in yeast, animals and plants. They share significant sequence in their C-terminal regions containing PHD finger domains, which have been implicated in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation [[cite:PUB00069016]]. The family includes proteins YNG1, YNG2 and Pho23 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00069016], [cite:PUB00092683]], png1 and png2 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe [[cite:PUB00069016]], inhibitor of growth proteins ING1-5 from mammals [[cite:PUB00068975]], and Arabidopsis homologues ING1 (At3g24010) and ING2 (At1g54390) [[cite:PUB00069017]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vnf", "name" "MOLECULAR BASIS OF HISTONE H3K4ME3 RECOGNITION BY ING4"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10333" "INHIBITOR OF GROWTH PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ING family", "short" "ING_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2551, "taxa" 10518, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15029, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15029, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9491}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028651", :literature {"PUB00069016" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Loewith R" "Meijer M" "Lees-Miller SP" "Riabowol K" "Young D."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
