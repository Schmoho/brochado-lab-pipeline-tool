{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) contains multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) [[cite:PUB00000614]]. PDC catalyses the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. In eukaryotes, PDC is located in the mitochondrial matrix [[cite:PUB00098394], [cite:PUB00098391]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a group of E3-binding proteins, including dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase protein X component (known as Pdx1). Pdx1, found only in eukaryotes, plays a structural role in the complex by binding and positioning dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) to the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) core [[cite:PUB00063000]]. Mutations in the Pdx1 gene has been linked to human disease [[cite:PUB00063000], [cite:PUB00098392]].
