{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several tyrosinase co-factor MELC1 proteins from a number of Streptomyces species. The melanin operon (melC) of Streptomyces antibioticus contains two genes, melC1 and melC2 (apotyrosinase). It is thought that MelC1 forms a transient binary complex with the downstream apotyrosinase MelC2 to facilitate the incorporation of copper ion and the secretion of tyrosinase indicating that MelC1 is a chaperone for the apotyrosinase MelC2 [[cite:PUB00012298]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6j2u", "name" "Crystal structure of Tyrosinase caddy protein(MelC1)with Tyrosinase (MelC2)from Streptomyces avermitilis in complex with Zinc ion"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023199", "name" "Copper chaperone GriE/MELC1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06236" "Tyrosinase co-factor MelC1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosinase co-factor MelC1", "short" "MelC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 312, "taxa" 951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 925}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010928", :literature {"PUB00012298" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Chen LY" "Chen MY" "Leu WM" "Tsai TY" "Lee YH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
