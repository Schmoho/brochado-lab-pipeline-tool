{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-hexulose 3, 5-epimerase (RmlC, [ec:5.1.3.13]) is involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-l-rhamnose, which is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall, converting dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose.</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of RmlC from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was determined in the presence and absence of a substrate analogue. RmlC is a homodimer comprising a central jelly roll motif, which extends in two directions into longer Î²-sheets. Binding of dTDP is stabilised by ionic interactions to the phosphate group and by a combination of ionic and hydrophobic interactions with the base. The active site, which is located in the centre of the jelly roll, is formed by residues that are conserved in all known RmlC sequence homologues. The active site is lined with a number of charged residues and a number of residues with hydrogen-bonding potentials, which together comprise a potential network for substrate binding and catalysis. The active site is also lined with aromatic residues which provide favorable environments for the base moiety of dTDP and potentially for the sugar moiety of the substrate [[cite:PUB00007928]].</p>\n\n<p>Also included in this family is the probable dTDP-4-oxo-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucose 3,5-epimerase from <i>Streptomyces antibioticus</i> which is required for the biosynthesis of the aglycone antibiotic oleandomycin [[cite:PUB00089648]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6c46", "name" "Crystal structure of dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase from Elizabethkingia anophelis NUHP1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00438" "RmlC carbohydrate epimerase, involved in dTDP-L-rhamnose production"}, "panther" {"PTHR21047" "DTDP-6-DEOXY-D-GLUCOSE-3,5 EPIMERASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00908" "dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01221" "dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase-like", "short" "RmlC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 45, "domain_architectures" 61, "proteomes" 7128, "taxa" 28841, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40875, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40863, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31456}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1032", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1032"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
