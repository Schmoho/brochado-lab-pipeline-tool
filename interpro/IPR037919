{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine--peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT; [ec:2.4.1.255]) is a heterotrimer of one 78kDa subunit and two 110kDa subunits.  OGT catalyzes the transfer of a single N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc to a serine or threonine residue in a protein.  Substrate proteins include histone H2B, AKT1, EZH2, PFKL, KMT2E/MLL5, MAPT/TAU and HCFC1.  The consequences of this form of glycosylation are diverse, including insulin resistance in muscle and adipocyte cells (brought about by inhibiting the 'Thr-308' phosphorylation of AKT1) [[cite:PUB00087866]]; regulation of glycolysis by inhibiting PFKL activity [[cite:PUB00087867]]; in the cell cycle O-glycosylation stabilizes ARNTL/BMAL1 and CLOCK, preventing their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [[cite:PUB00087868]]; glycosylation of HCFC1 and interaction with TET proteins promotes binding of the SET1/COMPASS methyltransferase SETD1A to chromatin [[cite:PUB00087869]]; and H2B GlcNAcylation is a histone modification that facilitates H2BK120 monoubiquitination [[cite:PUB00087870]].  It is a component of several complexes, including MLL5-L, NSL [[cite:PUB00060167]] and THAP1/THAP3-HCFC1-OGT [[cite:PUB00060556]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the 110kDa subunit which has thirteen tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats that are required for substrate binding and oligomerization [[cite:PUB00038020]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The NSL complex is involved in acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 on several lysine residues and therefore may be involved in the regulation of transcription.
