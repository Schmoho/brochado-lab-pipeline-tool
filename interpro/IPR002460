{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Synucleins are small, soluble proteins expressed primarily in neural tissue and in certain tumours [[cite:PUB00001947], [cite:PUB00007113]]. The family includes three known proteins: alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein, and gamma-synuclein. All synucleins have in common a highly conserved Î±-helical lipid-binding motif with similarity to the class-A2 lipid-binding domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins [[cite:PUB00007114]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Synuclein family members are not found outside vertebrates, although they have some conserved structural similarity with plant 'late-embryo-abundant' proteins. The alpha- and beta-synuclein proteins are found primarily in brain tissue, where they are seen mainly in presynaptic terminals [[cite:PUB00007115], [cite:PUB00007116]]. The gamma-synuclein protein is found primarily in the peripheral nervous system and retina, but its expression in breast tumors is a marker for tumor progression [[cite:PUB00007117]]. Normal cellular functions have not been determined for any of the synuclein proteins, although some data suggest a role in the regulation of membrane stability and/or turnover.  Mutations in alpha-synuclein are associated with rare familial cases of early-onset Parkinson's disease, and the protein accumulates abnormally in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and several other neurodegenerative illnesses [[cite:PUB00007118]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents alpha-synuclein, which regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking and subsequent neurotransmitter release [[cite:PUB00095328]].
