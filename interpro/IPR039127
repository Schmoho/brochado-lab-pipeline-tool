{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trm112 is a component of several multifunctional methyltransferases.  When associated with methyltransferase Mtq2, the enzyme methylates 'Gln-182' of eRF1.  Mtq2 is the catalytic subunit, and Trm112 is required for its solubility and activity [[cite:PUB00041889]].  When associated with methyltransferase Trm11, the enzyme forms 2-methylguanosine at position 10 (m2G10) in tRNA [[cite:PUB00020491]].  When associated with methyltransferase Bud23, the enzyme forms 7-methylguanine at position 1575 (m7G1575) in 18S rRNA [[cite:PUB00088958], [cite:PUB00088959]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6h2u", "name" "Crystal structure of human METTL5-TRMT112 complex, the 18S rRNA m6A1832 methyltransferase at 1.6A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12773" "UPF0315 PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Multifunctional methyltransferase subunit Trm112", "short" "Trm112"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2201, "taxa" 7908, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2529}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039127", :literature {"PUB00041889" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["Heurgue-Hamard V" "Graille M" "Scrima N" "Ulryck N" "Champ S" "van Tilbeurgh H" "Buckingham RH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
