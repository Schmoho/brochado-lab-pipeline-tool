{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Periplasmic L-arabinose-binding protein (ABP) is involved in the high-affinity L-arabinose membrane transport system. It binds with high affinity to arabinose, but can also bind D-galactose (at approximately 2-fold lower affinity) and D-fucose (at approximately 40-fold lower affinity) [[cite:PUB00060327], [cite:PUB00036325]].</p>\n\n<p>The periplasmic ABP consists of two α/β globular domains connected by a three-stranded hinge, a Venus flytrap-like domain, which undergoes a transition from an open to a closed conformational state upon ligand binding. Moreover, ABP is homologous to the ligand-binding domain of eukaryotic receptors such as metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and DNA-binding transcriptional repressors such as LacI and GalR [[cite:PUB00056198]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8abp", "name" "SUGAR-BINDING AND CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF AN ARABINOSE-BINDING PROTEIN MUTANT (MET108LEU) WHICH EXHIBITS ENHANCED AFFINITY AND ALTERED SPECIFICITY"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01540" "periplasmic L-arabinose-binding protein (ABP), a member of a family of pentose/hexose sugar-binding proteins of the type 1 periplasmic binding protein superfamily"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002816" "L-arabinose-binding periplasmic protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-arabinose-binding periplasmic protein", "short" "AraF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 384, "taxa" 2609, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2891, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2890, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2208}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026266", :literature {"PUB00060327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Newcomer ME" "Gilliland GL" "Quiocho FA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
