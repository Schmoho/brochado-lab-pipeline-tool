{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family, previously known as DUF774, consists of uncharacterised proteins predominantly found in Actinomycetes, including Rv2714 ([swissprot:O07213]) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This protein adopts a trimeric configuration, in which each monomer is organised into two domains: a central β-sheet of eight strands flanked by three α-helices at the N-terminal and four α-helices at the C-terminal [[cite:PUB00100672]]. Members of this family were thought to be orthologues of the eukaryotic proteasome assembly chaperone 2 (PAC2), however, they don't appear to function as proteasome assembly chaperones [[cite:PUB00100673]]. The function of these proteins remains unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038389", "name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone 2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF028754" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP028754 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rv2714-like", "short" "Rv2714-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1893, "taxa" 5533, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10213, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10150, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7873}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008492", :literature {"PUB00100672" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 10", "authors" ["Grana M" "Bellinzoni M" "Miras I" "Fiez-Vandal C" "Haouz A" "Shepard W" "Buschiazzo A" "Alzari PM."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun", "title" "Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2714, a representative of a duplicated gene family in Actinobacteria.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "972-7", "volume" "65", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19851001}, "PUB00100673" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Bai L" "Jastrab JB" "Isasa M" "Hu K" "Yu H" "Gygi SP" "Darwin KH" "Li H."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Structural Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Homologues of the Eukaryotic Proteasome Assembly Chaperone 2 (PAC2).", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "199", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28193903}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019151", "name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone 2", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004425", "name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone MJ0106-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004426", "name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone MJ1210-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR008492", "name" "Rv2714-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016562", "name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone 2, eukaryotic", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
