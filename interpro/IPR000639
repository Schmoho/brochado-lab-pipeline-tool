{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The α/β hydrolase fold is common to a number of hydrolytic enzymes of widely differing phylogenetic\norigin and catalytic function. The core of each enzyme is an α/β-sheet (rather than a barrel), containing\n8 strands connected by helices [[cite:PUB00004958]]. The enzymes are believed to have diverged from a common ancestor,\npreserving the arrangement of the catalytic residues. All have a catalytic triad, the elements of which are borne\non loops, which are the best conserved structural features of the fold. The epoxide hydrolases (EH) add water to\nepoxides, forming the corresponding diol. On the basis of sequence similarity, it has been proposed that the\nmammalian soluble EHs contain 2 evolutionarily distinct domains, the N-terminal domain is similar to bacterial\nhaloacid dehalogenase, while the C-terminal domain is similar to soluble plant EH, microsomal EH, and bacterial\nhaloalkane dehalogenase (HLD) [[cite:PUB00001119]]. The mechanism of HLD, established by X-ray crystallographic analysis\nof an HDL-substrate intermediate [[cite:PUB00004149]], involves nucleophilic attack of Asp-124 on the halogen-substituted\nterminal carbon of the substrate, forming a covalently-bound ester intermediate. The Asp-260/His-289 pair\nactivate a water molecule that hydrolyses the ester intermediate to release the product. The similarity of EH to\nHLD is important for deducing a catalytic mechanism for EH. Mutagenesis experiments on murine soluble EH\nconfirmed the crucial role of nucleophile Asp-333 and His-523 in the catalytic mechanism and the importance of\nconserved His-263 and His-332 [[cite:PUB00002948]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00412" "EPOXHYDRLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Epoxide hydrolase-like", "short" "Epox_hydrolase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 442, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9337, "taxa" 34770, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 681091, "sets" 0, "proteins" 170393, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 125110}, "pathways" 84}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
