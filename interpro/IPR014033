{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>L-Arginine is converted to nitric oxide and citrulline by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and by the enzyme arginase as a part of the hepatic urea cycle [[cite:PUB00017651]]. Arginase is a manganese metalloenzyme containing a metal-activated hydroxide ion, a critical nucleophile in metalloenzymes that catalyze hydrolysis or hydration reactions. A hydrogen bond formed by the metal-bound hydroxide holds the enzyme in the proper orientation for catalysis however non-metal substrate-binding sites are also implicated in the enzyme mechanism. Regeneration of metal-bound hydroxide ion from a metal-bound water molecule requires proton transfer to bulk solvent mediated by a histidine proton shuttle residue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4hze", "name" "Crystal structure of human Arginase-2 complexed with inhibitor 9"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023696", "name" "Ureohydrolase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09989" "Arginase family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01229" "arginase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arginase", "short" "Arginase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 146, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4091, "taxa" 15010, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12569, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9146}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1428", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1428"} {"accession" "GenProp0643", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0643"} {"accession" "GenProp1300", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1300"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
