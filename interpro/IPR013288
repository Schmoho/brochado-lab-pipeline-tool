{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit IV is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that forms part of the 13-subunit COX complex, the terminal oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The enzyme catalyses the reaction:<reaction>4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome c + 2 H(2)O</reaction>This polypeptide belongs to a wider family of proteins that includes the Dictyostelium discoideum (Slime mold) COX VI and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) protein YGX6. The 3D structure of the whole bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase has been determined to 2.8A resolution by means of X-ray crystallography [[cite:PUB00005218], [cite:PUB00017275]]. The structure reveals 13 different subunits, five phosphatidyl ethanolamines, three phosphatidyl glycerols, two cholates, two haems A, and a number of copper, magnesium and zinc ions [[cite:PUB00005218]]. A hydrogen-bonded system, including a propionate of haem A, part of the peptide backbone, and an imidazole ligand of CuA, may provide an electron transfer pathway between CuA and haem A [[cite:PUB00005218]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036639", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01873" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit IV signature"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_su4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 99, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 918, "taxa" 3811, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8764, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2356, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1582}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013288", :literature {"PUB00005218" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5265", "authors" ["Tsukihara T" "Aoyama H" "Yamashita E" "Tomizaki T" "Yamaguchi H" "Shinzawa-Itoh K" "Nakashima R" "Yaono R" "Yoshikawa S."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/272/5265/1136", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The whole structure of the 13-subunit oxidized cytochrome c oxidase at 2.8 A.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "1136-44", "volume" "272", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8638158}, "PUB00017275" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["Tomizaki T" "Yamashita E" "Yamaguchi H" "Aoyama H" "Tsukihara T" "Shinzawa-Itoh K" "Nakashima R" "Yaono R" "Yoshikawa S."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
