{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Brme1 (also known as Meiok21) is a component of meiotic recombination bridges involved in meiotic double-strand break repair [[cite:PUB00095580], [cite:PUB00095581]]. The C-terminal domain of Brme1 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of HSF2BP [[cite:PUB00095580]]. BRME1 facilitates the loading of RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases onto DSBs (DNA double-strand breaks) through interaction with MEILB2/HSF2BP and replacing ssDNA binding proteins [[cite:PUB00095581]]. Brme1 is highly expressed in mice testes and fetal ovaries. Knockout of Brme1 results in male mice infertility [[cite:PUB00095580]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8a51", "name" "Crystal structure of HSF2BP-BRME1 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15710" "Break repair meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR14583" "UNCHARACTERIZED PROTEIN C19ORF57 FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Break repair meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1", "short" "Brme1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 184, "taxa" 814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 569, "sets" 0, "proteins" 397, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 247}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031441", :literature {"PUB00095581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Takemoto K" "Tani N" "Takada-Horisawa Y" "Fujimura S" "Tanno N" "Yamane M" "Okamura K" "Sugimoto M" "Araki K" "Ishiguro KI."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Meiosis-Specific C19orf57/4930432K21Rik/BRME1 Modulates Localization of RAD51 and DMC1 to DSBs in Mouse Meiotic Recombination.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "107686", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32460033}, "PUB00095580" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Shang Y" "Huang T" "Liu H" "Liu Y" "Liang H" "Yu X" "Li M" "Zhai B" "Yang X" "Wei Y" "Wang G" "Chen Z" "Wang S" "Zhang L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "MEIOK21: a new component of meiotic recombination bridges required for spermatogenesis.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "6624-6639", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32463460}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:1990918", "name" "double-strand break repair involved in meiotic recombination", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031441", "name" "Break repair meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 15, "alignment:full" 406}}}
