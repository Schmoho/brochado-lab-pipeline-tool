{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes nitrilases, cyanide hydratases (CHs) and related proteins.

This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), this subgroup corresponds to class 1 [[cite:PUB00016878], [cite:PUB00016852]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Nitrilases  ([ec:3.5.5.1]) are enzymes that convert nitriles into their corresponding acids and ammonia.

A conserved cysteine has been shown [[cite:PUB00004812], [cite:PUB00002743]] to be essential for enzyme activity; it seems to be involved in a nucleophilic attack on the\nnitrile carbon atom.
