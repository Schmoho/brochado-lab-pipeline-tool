EutQ is an acetate kinase necessary to drive flux through the pathway under physiological conditions, preventing a buildup of acetaldehyde. The ATP generated by EutQ may be used as a substrate for EutT, the ATP-dependent corrinoid adenosyltransferase, and for the EutA ethanolamine ammonia-lyase reactivase [[cite:PUB00096913]]. Proteins in this family belong to the cupin superfamily with a conserved jelly roll-like Î²-barrel fold capable of homodimerization. In contrast to the metal-binding catalytic cupins, the EutQ family does not possess the histidine residues that are responsible for metal coordination in the oxidoreductase and epimerase classes of cupins [[cite:PUB00063996]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2pyt", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative ethanolamine utilization protein q (eutq, stm2468) from salmonella typhimurium lt2 at 1.90 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36169" "ETHANOLAMINE UTILIZATION PROTEIN EUTQ"}, "pfam" {"PF06249" "Ethanolamine utilisation protein EutQ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetate kinase EutQ", "short" "EutQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 24, "proteomes" 1146, "taxa" 4930, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4784, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4763, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3507}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0292", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0292"} {"accession" "GenProp1762", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1762"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
