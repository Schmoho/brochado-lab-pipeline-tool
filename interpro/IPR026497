{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A 4Fe-4S-binding C-terminal domain is shared by radical SAM maturases for Subtilosin A (S), PQQ (P), Anaerobic sulfatases (AS), and mycofactocin (M), hence SPASM. Radical SAM proteins with SPASM tend to be peptide maturases. All members of this family, like some members of the quasi-rSAM family, lack the 4Fe-4S cluster of the radical SAM domain in the N-terminal region. Members of this family occur with an ATP-GRASP family protein, known as a possible maturase from microviridin biosynthetic clusters. Systems occur in Microscilla marina ATCC 23134, Kordia algicida OT-1, Sphingobacterium spiritivorum ATCC 33300, etc.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04193" "grasp-with-spasm system SPASM domain peptide maturase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPASM domain peptide maturase, GRASP-with-SPASM system", "short" "GRASP-with-SPASM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 81, "taxa" 460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 444, "sets" 0, "proteins" 444, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 387}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1002", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1002"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026497", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026497", "name" "SPASM domain peptide maturase, GRASP-with-SPASM system", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
