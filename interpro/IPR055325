{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents human Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 161 (CF161) and similar proteins mainly found in animals. CF161 consists of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that are integral components of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the axoneme of cilia [[cite:PUB00103594]]. These proteins are essential for the proper functioning of motile cilia, as they play a critical role in cilia beating. The coordinated beating of cilia is vital for various physiological processes, including fluid movement across epithelial surfaces, cell motility, and sensory reception.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24569" "Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 161-like domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR24274" "CILIA- AND FLAGELLA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 161"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 161", "short" "CF161"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 934, "taxa" 3741, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1775, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1701, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1165}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055325", :literature {"PUB00103594" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Gui M" "Croft JT" "Zabeo D" "Acharya V" "Kollman JM" "Burgoyne T" "Hoog JL" "Brown A."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "SPACA9 is a lumenal protein of human ciliary singlet and doublet microtubules.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e2207605119", "volume" "119", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36191189}, "PUB00152767" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7965", "authors" ["Walton T" "Gui M" "Velkova S" "Fassad MR" "Hirst RA" "Haarman E" "O'Callaghan C" "Bottier M" "Burgoyne T" "Mitchison HM" "Brown A."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06140-2", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Axonemal structures reveal mechanoregulatory and disease mechanisms.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "625-633", "volume" "618", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37258679}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055325", "name" "Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 161", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 15, "alignment:full" 1114}}}
