{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two major structural proteins from the lactococcal temperate bacteriophage TP901-1 have been sequenced: the Major Head Protein (MHP) and the Major Tail Protein (MTP) [[cite:PUB00015485]]. Homologues of the major tail protein have since been found in Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus phages. The sequences are fairly short, typically ~150-200 amino acid residues in length, and are well conserved.
