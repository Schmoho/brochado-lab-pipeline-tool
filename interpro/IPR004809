The phylogeny of the 1-alpha and 1-beta forms appears polyphyletic. Escherichia coli, Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), Aquifex aeolicus, and the crenarcheon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius have form 1-beta, while Bacillus subtilis, Thermotoga maritima, and various euryarchaea has form 1-alpha. The 1-beta dodecamer from the crenarcheon S. acidocaldarius differs from that in E. coli in that it is not regulated by adenylation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8ool", "name" "Glutamine synthetase from Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus with TbXo4 at a resolution of 1.65 A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014746", "name" "Glutamine synthetase/guanido kinase, catalytic domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00653" "glutamine synthetase, type I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamine synthetase type I", "short" "Gln_synth_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7268, "taxa" 28581, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34855, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34855, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27507}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1615", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1615"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
