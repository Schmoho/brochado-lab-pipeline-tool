{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This small clade of ABC-type transporter permease protein components is found as a three gene cassette along with a periplasmic substrate-binding protein ([ncbifam:TIGR03868]) and an ATPase ([ncbifam:TIGR03873]). The organisms containing this cassette are all Actinobacteria and all contain numerous genes requiring the coenzyme F420. This model was defined based on five such organisms, four of which are lacking all F420 biosynthetic capability save the final side-chain polyglutamate attachment step (via the gene cofE: [ncbifam:TIGR01916]). In Jonesia denitrificans DSM 20603 and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1 this cassette is in an apparent operon with the cofE gene and, in PHSC20C1, also with an F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ([ncbifam:TIGR03554]). Based on these observations we propose that this permease protein is a component of a F420-0 (that is, F420 lacking only the polyglutamate tail) transporter.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037294", "name" "ABC transporter, BtuC-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03869" "putative F420-0 ABC transporter permease subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, permease F420-0", "short" "ABC_transptr_permease_F420-0"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 153, "taxa" 423, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 312, "sets" 0, "proteins" 312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 263}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0896", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0896"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022410", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000522", "name" "ABC transporter, permease protein, BtuC-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR022410", "name" "ABC transporter, permease F420-0", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023691", "name" "ABC transporter, vitamin B12 import, permease protein BtuC", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
