{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of enzymes belongs to the GHMP kinase domain superfamily. GHMP kinases are a unique class of ATP-dependent enzymes (the abbreviation of which refers to the original members: galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) [[cite:PUB00015675]]. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily contain three well-conserved motifs, the second of which has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala and is involved in ATP binding [[cite:PUB00015644]]. The phosphate binding loop in GHMP kinases is distinct from the classical P-loops found in many ATP/GTP binding proteins. The bound ADP molecule adopts a rare syn conformation and is in the opposite orientation from those bound to the P-loop-containing proteins [[cite:PUB00015644]]. GHMP kinases display a distinctly bilobal appearance with their N-terminal subdomains dominated by a mixed β-sheet flanked on one side by α-helices and their C-terminal subdomains containing a four stranded anti-parallel β-sheet [[cite:PUB00015835], [cite:PUB00015644], [cite:PUB00015669], [cite:PUB00015730]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The classical mevalonate (MVA) pathway involves decarboxylation of mevalonate diphosphate, while an alternate pathway involves decarboxylation of mevalonate monophosphate.
