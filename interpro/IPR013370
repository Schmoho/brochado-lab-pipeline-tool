{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of muconate cycloisomerase (or Muconate Lactonizing Enzyme (MLE); [ec:5.5.1.1]) and chloromuconate cycloisomerase (or chloromuconate lactonizing enzymes (Cl-MLEs); [ec:5.5.1.7]),  enzymes that often overlap in specificity. It does not include more distantly related proteins such as mandelate racemase ([ec:5.1.2.2]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MLE, a homooctameric enzyme, catalyses the conversion of cis,cis-muconate to muconolactone in the catechol branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway [[cite:PUB00080865], [cite:PUB00080866]]. This pathway is used in soil microbes to breakdown lignin-derived aromatics, catechol and protocatechuate, to citric acid cycle intermediates. Some bacterial species are also capable of dehalogenating chloroaromatic compounds by the action of Cl-MLEs. MLEs are members of the enolase superfamily characterized by the presence of an enolate anion intermediate which is generated by abstraction of the alpha-proton of the carboxylate substrate by an active site residue and that is stabilized by coordination to the essential Mg2+ ion [[cite:PUB00069767], [cite:PUB00080864]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1muc", "name" "STRUCTURE OF MUCONATE LACTONIZING ENZYME AT 1.85 ANGSTROMS RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029017", "name" "Enolase-like, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036849", "name" "Enolase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01258" "(chloro)muconate cycloisomerase (syn) like"}, "cdd" {"cd03318" "MLE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02534" "muconate/chloromuconate family cycloisomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Muconate/chloromuconate cycloisomerase", "short" "Chloromuconate_cycloisomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 547, "taxa" 3164, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3347, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3347, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2729}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0711", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0711"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
