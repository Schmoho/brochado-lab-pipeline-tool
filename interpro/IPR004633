{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family describes essentially the full length of an uncharacterised protein from Bacillus subtilis (YqeW) and corresponding lengths of longer proteins from Escherichia coli and Treponema pallidum. There is homology to one other group of proteins, type II sodium/phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporters. A well-conserved repeated domain in this family, approximately 60 residues in length, is also repeated in the Na/Pi cotransporters, although with greater spacing between the repeats. The two families share additional homology in the region after the first repeat, share the property of having extensive hydrophobic regions, and may be similar in function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00704" "Na/Pi-cotransporter II-related protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Na/Pi-cotransporter II-related/YqeW-like protein", "short" "NaPi_cotrn-rel/YqeW-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2124, "taxa" 10160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12363, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12363, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9276}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004633", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003841", "name" "Sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004633", "name" "Na/Pi-cotransporter II-related/YqeW-like protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
