{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents prenyl-diphosphate phosphatases from archaea, including that from Methanosarcina mazei (also known as Nudix hydrolase MM_2582). It hydrolyzes homoallylic isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and short-chain prenyl diphosphates geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to their corresponding monophosphate forms with high activity. The preferred substrate is IPP. ADP, NADPH, Ap5A and thiamine diphosphate (TPP) are weakly hydrolyzed. It shows no hydrolysis with ATP, dNTPs, 8-OH-dGTP, NAD, FAD or acetyl-CoA. The likely physiological role of this enzyme is to provide a substrate dimethylallyl phosphate (DMAP) for prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prenyl-FMN) synthase MM_1871 involved in the biosynthesis of prenyl-FMN, a coenzyme required in the archaea-specific mevalonate pathway [[cite:PUB00151428]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041653" "Nudix hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prenyl-diphosphate phosphatase", "short" "Prenyl-diphosphate_PPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 61, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 47, "sets" 0, "proteins" 47, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
