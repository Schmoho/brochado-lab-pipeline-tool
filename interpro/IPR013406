{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry defines several short bacterial proteins, typically about 75 amino acids long, which are always found as part of a pair (at least) of small genes. The other protein in the pair always belongs to a family of plasmid stabilisation proteins ([interpro:IPR007712]). It is likely that this protein and its partner comprise some form of addiction module -a pair of genes consisting of a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin which mediate programmed cell death [[cite:PUB00020763]] -although these gene pairs are usually found on the bacterial main chromosome.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09720" "Putative addiction module component"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02574" "putative addiction module component, TIGR02574 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP02574, addiction module", "short" "CHP02574_addiction_mod"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 806, "taxa" 4768, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8278, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8275, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5943}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0321", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0321"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013406", :literature {"PUB00020763" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Engelberg-Kulka H" "Glaser G."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
