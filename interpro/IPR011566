{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<P>Coq7 (also known as Clk-1 and CAT5) is a di-iron carboxylate protein occuring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that is essential for ubiquinone biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00054991], [cite:PUB00054992]]. It has been implicated in the aging process as mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans gene lead to increased lifespan [[cite:PUB00054993]]. Coq7 is a membrane-bound protein that functions as a monooxygenase to hydroxylate demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ or 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone) in the penultimate step of ubiquinone biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00054994]]. Biochemical studies indicate that NADH can serve directly as a reductant for catalytic activation of dioxygen and substrate oxidation by the enzyme, with no requirement for an additional reductase protein component [[cite:PUB00054995]]. This direct reaction with NADH is so far unique amongst members of the di-iron carboxylate protein family.</P>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01042" "Demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, ferritin-like diiron-binding domain"}, "hamap" {"MF_01658" "3-demethoxyubiquinol 3-hydroxylase [coq7]"}, "panther" {"PTHR11237" "COENZYME Q10 BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN 7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquinone biosynthesis protein Coq7", "short" "Ubq_synth_Coq7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3862, "taxa" 14059, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11667, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11666, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8551}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
