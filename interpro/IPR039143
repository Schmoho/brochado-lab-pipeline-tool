{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family groups acetyltransferases with broad specificity from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, including glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNPNAT1; [ec:2.3.1.4]) from mammals and plants, and GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase 3 (GNAT3) from plants.</p>\n\n<p>GNPNAT1 is a component in the pathway for UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine biosynthesis. GNPNAT1 transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to D-glucosamine 6-phosphate to generate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate [[cite:PUB00051171]]. The enzyme contains a GNAT domain and is naturally a homodimer [[cite:PUB00051171]]. The enzyme from <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, the causative agent of aspergillosis, is a potential drug target [[cite:PUB00049950]].</p>\n\n<p>GNAT3 is an acetyltransferase with dual specificity triggering both N-alpha-acetylation (NTA) and epsilon-lysine acetylation (KA), possibly with a low efficiency or toward specific plastid substrates [[cite:PUB00103909]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3t90", "name" "Crystal structure of glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13355" "GLUCOSAMINE 6-PHOSPHATE N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase-like", "short" "GNPNAT1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4348, "taxa" 17756, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15575, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15575, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11157}, "pathways" 225}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
