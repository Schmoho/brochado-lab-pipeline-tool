{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins specific to beta and gamma proteobacteria, including the type VI secretion system (T6SS) immunity protein TsiT from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ([swissprot:Q9HXA5]), which belongs to the Imm52 family. This protein can suppress the virulence of TseT [[cite:PUB00100869]]. TsiT adopts a β-sandwich fold with nine α-helices and an eight-stranded antiparallel central β-sheet. It has a large electro-negative pocket with hydrophobic surroundings that play a role in the interaction with TseT [[cite:PUB00100870], [cite:PUB00100868]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6jdp", "name" "the imm52 family protein TsiT (PA3908) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF029636" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP029636 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Imm52 family, TsiT-like", "short" "TsiT-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 177, "sets" 0, "proteins" 177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 152}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016929", :literature {"PUB00100868" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Wen H" "Liu G" "Geng Z" "Zhang H" "Li Y" "She Z" "Dong Y."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Biol Macromol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Biol Macromol", "title" "Structure and SAXS studies unveiled a novel inhibition mechanism of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T6SS TseT-TsiT complex.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "450-459", "volume" "188", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34371041}, "PUB00100869" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Burkinshaw BJ" "Liang X" "Wong M" "Le ANH" "Lam L" "Dong TG."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "A type VI secretion system effector delivery mechanism dependent on PAAR and a chaperone-co-chaperone complex.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "632-640", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29632369}, "PUB00100870" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["She Z" "Geng Z" "Xu JH" "Li YH" "Dong YH."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Structural characterization of the Imm52 family protein TsiT in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "971-975", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30834616}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016929", "name" "Imm52 family, TsiT-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
