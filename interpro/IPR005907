{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins comprises a tightly conserved but broadly distributed subfamily (here designated as short form) of known and putative bacterial glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases ([ec:2.7.7.24], also known as dTDP-D-glucose synthase). It is well characterised in several species as the first of four enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, a cell wall constituent and a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme. The enzyme is active as a homotetramer [[cite:PUB00080745], [cite:PUB00025526], [cite:PUB00028942], [cite:PUB00026041], [cite:PUB00021622]].</p>\n\n<p><reaction>dTTP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate = diphosphate + dTDP-glucose</reaction>.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fxo", "name" "THE STRUCTURAL BASIS OF THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM AND REGULATION OF GLUCOSE-1-PHOSPHATE THYMIDYLYLTRANSFERASE (RMLA).
