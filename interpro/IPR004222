{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methane monooxygenases ([ec:1.14.13.25]) catalyse the oxidation of methane to methanol in the presence of oxygen and NADH in methanotrophs. It has a broad specificity, hydroxylating many alkanes, and converting alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. In additional reactions, CO is oxidized to CO2, ammonia is oxidized to hydroxylamine, and some aromatic compounds and cyclic alkanes can also be hydroxylated, although more slowly. In Methylococcus capsulatus there are two forms of the enzyme, a soluble and a membrane-bound type. The soluble form consists of 3 components, A, B and C. Protein A is made up of 3 chains, alpha, beta and gamma.</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents the gamma chain of methane monooxygenases. Structurally, the gamma chain contains two domains, each consisting of a three helices arranged in an open bundle topology [[cite:PUB00021642], [cite:PUB00036067]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mty", "name" "METHANE MONOOXYGENASE HYDROXYLASE FROM METHYLOCOCCUS CAPSULATUS (BATH)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036123", "name" "Methane monooxygenase, gamma chain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015953", "name" "Methane monooxygenase, gamma chain, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015952", "name" "Methane monooxygenase, gamma chain, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF018503" "Butane/methane monooxygenase hydroxylase, gamma subunit"}, "pfam" {"PF02964" "Methane monooxygenase, hydrolase gamma chain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methane monooxygenase, gamma chain", "short" "Me_mOase_g"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 69, "sets" 0, "proteins" 69, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 66}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
