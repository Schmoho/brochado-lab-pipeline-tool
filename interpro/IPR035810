{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) are present in all three major phylogenetic divisions (eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea). The members in this subgroup are present in eukaryotes. Members here include those in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS (FT) ([Swissprot:Q9SXZ2]) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) ([Swissprot:P93003]), which function as a promoter and a repressor of the floral transitions respectively [[cite:PUB00074494], [cite:PUB00074674], [cite:PUB00046815]], as well as the mammalian Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), also known as phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP-1) ([Swissprot:P30086]), which inhibits MAP kinase (Raf-MEK-ERK), G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase and NFkappaB signalling cascades [[cite:PUB00086244], [cite:PUB00086245]]. Also, a member of this family is the large ribosomal subunit protein mL38 (MRPL38, known as MRPL35 in yeast) ([Swissprot:Q96DV4]), which is located in the central protuberance of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00089007]]. Although their overall structures are similar, the members of the PEBP family have very different substrates and oligomerisation states (monomer/dimer/tetramer).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6igg", "name" "Crystal structure of FT condition 1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036610", "name" "PEBP-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00866" "PhosphatidylEthanolamine-Binding Protein (PEBP) domain present in eukaryotes"}, "panther" {"PTHR11362" "PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE-BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, eukaryotic", "short" "PEBP_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 117, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2573, "taxa" 9385, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18117, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17997, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11567}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035810", :literature {"PUB00074674" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hanano S" "Goto K."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.088641", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER1 is involved in the regulation of flowering time and inflorescence development through transcriptional repression.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "3172-84", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21890645}, "PUB00074494" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Mathieu J" "Warthmann N" "Kuttner F" "Schmid M."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
