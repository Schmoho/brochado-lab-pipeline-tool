{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents part of a family of closely related, thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes includes indolepyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC, [ec:4.1.1.74])[[cite:PUB00015910], [cite:PUB00102228]], pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, [ec:4.1.1.1]) [[cite:PUB00102234]], branched-chain alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase, etc [[cite:PUB00042068]]. PDC catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO2 in alcoholic fermentation. IPDC plays a role in the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway in plants and various plant-associated bacteria, it catalyses the decarboxylation of IPA to IAA. Also belonging to this entry is Mycobacterium tuberculosis alpha-keto acid decarboxylase (MtKDC) which participates in amino acid degradation via the Ehrlich pathway [[cite:PUB00102231]], and Lactococcus lactis branched-chain keto acid decarboxylase (KdcA) an enzyme identified as being involved in cheese ripening, which exhibits a very broad substrate range in the decarboxylation and carboligation reactions [[cite:PUB00049666]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vk8", "name" "Crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate decarboxylase variant E477Q in complex with its substrate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43452" "PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036565" "Pyruvate decarboxylase/indolepyruvate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyruvate decarboxylase/indolepyruvate decarboxylase-like", "short" "PDC/IPDC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2221, "taxa" 9212, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12662, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12416, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8464}, "pathways" 56}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
