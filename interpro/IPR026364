{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of proteins closely related to Ax21. Ax21 was thought to be secreted by a type I-secretion system and to activate XA21-mediated immunity. Later, it was found that Ax21 secretion does not depend on the predicted type I secretion system and that it is processed by the general secretion (Sec) system. In fact, Ax21 is an outer membrane protein, secreted in association with outer membrane vesicles [[cite:PUB00075966]]. It does not trigger plant XA21-mediated immune response, as previously thought [[cite:PUB00075966]]. This role is performed by RaxX [[cite:PUB00082636]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023614", "name" "Porin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041455" "diffusible signal factor-reguated Ax21 faimly protein", "TIGR04273" "Ax21 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ax21 family", "short" "Ax21"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 77, "taxa" 355, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 413, "sets" 0, "proteins" 413, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 299}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026364", :literature {"PUB00075966" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Bahar O" "Pruitt R" "Luu DD" "Schwessinger B" "Daudi A" "Liu F" "Ruan R" "Fontaine-Bodin L" "Koebnik R" "Ronald P."], "ISO_journal" "PeerJ", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.242", "medline_journal" "PeerJ", "title" "The Xanthomonas Ax21 protein is processed by the general secretory system and is secreted in association with outer membrane vesicles.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e242", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24482761}, "PUB00082636" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Pruitt RN" "Schwessinger B" "Joe A" "Thomas N" "Liu F" "Albert M" "Robinson MR" "Chan LJ" "Luu DD" "Chen H" "Bahar O" "Daudi A" "De Vleesschauwer D" "Caddell D" "Zhang W" "Zhao X" "Li X" "Heazlewood JL" "Ruan D" "Majumder D" "Chern M" "Kalbacher H" "Midha S" "Patil PB" "Sonti RV" "Petzold CJ" "Liu CC" "Brodbelt JS" "Felix G" "Ronald PC."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1500245", "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "The rice immune receptor XA21 recognizes a tyrosine-sulfated protein from a Gram-negative bacterium.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e1500245", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26601222}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026364", "name" "Ax21 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
