{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes FAM171A1, FAM171A2 and FAM171B. FAM171A1 is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein also known as astroprincin (APCN) due to its abundant expression in astrocytes. APCN is also expressed in placental trophoblasts, skeletal and heart muscle, kidney and pancreas [[cite:PUB00100164]]. APCN is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeletal dynamics, playing a role in actin stress fibre formation. The APCN gene is located on chromosome 10p13, a region that is deleted in DiGeorge type 2 and velocardiofacial syndromes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31626" "SUSHI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAM171", "short" "FAM171"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 648, "taxa" 2215, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2773, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2773, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1798}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018890", :literature {"PUB00100164" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Rasila T" "Saavalainen O" "Attalla H" "Lankila P" "Haglund C" "Holtta E" "Andersson LC."], "ISO_journal" "Am J Pathol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Am J Pathol", "title" "Astroprincin (FAM171A1, C10orf38): A Regulator of Human Cell Shape and Invasive Growth.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "177-189", "volume" "189", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30312582}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018890", "name" "FAM171", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
