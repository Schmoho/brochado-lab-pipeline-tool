{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consist of the morpho-protein BolA from Escherichia coli and its various homologues. In E. coli, over-expression of this protein causes round morphology and may be involved in switching the cell between elongation and septation systems during cell division [[cite:PUB00003882]]. The expression of BolA is growth rate regulated and is induced during the transition into the the stationary phase [[cite:PUB00003882]]. BolA is also induced by stress during early stages of growth [[cite:PUB00003882]] and may have a general role in stress response. It has also been suggested that BolA can induce the transcription of penicillin binding proteins 6 and 5 [[cite:PUB00001179], [cite:PUB00003882]]. IbaG is a BolA homologue involved in acid resistance [[cite:PUB00074298]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5nfm", "name" "Crystal structure of YrbA from Sinorhizobium meliloti in complex with copper."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036065", "name" "BolA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01722" "BolA-like protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003113" "Stress-induced morphoprotein, BolA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BolA protein", "short" "BolA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 167, "proteomes" 6232, "taxa" 24204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39508, "sets" 0, "proteins" 39448, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29337}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002634", :literature {"PUB00003882" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Santos JM" "Freire P" "Vicente M" "Arraiano CM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
