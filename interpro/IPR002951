{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Atrophin-1 is the protein product of the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene. DRPLA [OMIM:125370] is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene on chromosome 12p. This results in an extended polyglutamine region in atrophin-1, that is thought to confer toxicity to the protein, possibly through altering its interactions with other proteins [[cite:PUB00019182], [cite:PUB00019181]]. The expansion of a CAG repeat is also the underlying defect in six other neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. One interaction of expanded polyglutamine repeats that is thought to be pathogenic is that with the short glutamine repeat in the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. This interaction draws CBP away from its usual nuclear location to the expanded polyglutamine repeat protein aggregates that are characteristic of the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders. This interferes with CBP-mediated transcription and causes cytotoxicity [[cite:PUB00019181]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes Atrophin-1 and related proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03154" "Atrophin-1 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Atrophin-like", "short" "Atrophin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 65, "proteomes" 797, "taxa" 3603, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4881, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3528, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1209}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002951", :literature {"PUB00019181" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wood JD" "Yuan J" "Margolis RL" "Colomer V" "Duan K" "Kushi J" "Kaminsky Z" "Kleiderlein JJ" "Sharp AH" "Ross CA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
