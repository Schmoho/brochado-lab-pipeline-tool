{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA polymerase III is a complex, multichain holoenzyme responsible for most of the replicative synthesis in bacteria [[cite:PUB00080350]]. It functions by adding nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) residues to the 5'-end of a growing DNA chain, using a complementary DNA as template. The elongation factor beta-clamp, also called beta subunit, is part of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. However, beta-clamp is not attached to polymerase III permanently like the other subunits. It is loaded on the DNA, by clamp loader, a subunit of DNA Pol III [[cite:PUB00086412]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The beta clamp forms a ring shaped dimer that encircles dsDNA (sliding clamp) in bacteria.
