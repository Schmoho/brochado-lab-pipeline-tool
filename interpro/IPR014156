The NikABCDE uptake system that contains this protein also contain a homologous permease subunit NikC [[cite:PUB00035598]]. Based on sequence similarity, NikA is the periplasmic binding protein, NikB and NikC are the membrane components, and NikD and NikE are the ATP-binding components of the ABC transporter. Nickel is used in cells as part of urease or certain hydrogenases or superoxide dismutases.
