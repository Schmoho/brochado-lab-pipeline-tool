{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SwaI is a Type IIP restriction endonuclease that recognises a palindromic eight base pair symmetric sequence, 5'-ATTTAAAT-3', and cleaves this target sequence at its centre to generate blunt-ended DNA fragments. SwaI forms a dimeric α/β structure, with each subunit having a central cradle-like mixed β-sheet with two helices packed on its concave side and a C-terminal helix contributing to the dimer interface [[cite:PUB00154249]]. SwaI has a significant similarity to other restriction endonucleases such as HincII, NlaIV, HindIII and EcoRV.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5tgq", "name" "Restriction-modification system Type II R.SwaI, DNA free"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22081" "SwaI restriction endonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SwaI restriction endonuclease", "short" "SwaI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 130, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054305", :literature {"PUB00154249" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Shen BW" "Heiter DF" "Lunnen KD" "Wilson GG" "Stoddard BL."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1200", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "DNA recognition by the SwaI restriction endonuclease involves unusual distortion of an 8 base pair A:T-rich target.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1516-1528", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28180307}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054305", "name" "SwaI restriction endonuclease", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 5}}}
