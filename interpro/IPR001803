{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bluetongue virus is a representative of the Orbivirus genus of the Reoviridae [[cite:PUB00004198]]. Orbiviruses infect mammalian hosts through insect vectors, causing economically-important diseases of domesticated animals [[cite:PUB00004198]]. They possess a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome within a capsid that comprises four major polypeptides, designated VP2, VP3, VP5 and VP7. On entering a target cell, an outer layer, formed from VP2 and VP5, is removed, leaving an intact core within the cell [[cite:PUB00004198]]. The core, which is 70nm across, contains 780 copies of VP7, which together form 260 trimeric 'bristly' capsomeres clothing an inner scaffold constructed from VP3 [[cite:PUB00004198]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3D structure of VP7 reveals two domains, one a β-sandwich, the other a bundle of α-helices, and a short C-terminal arm, which is thought to unite trimers during capsid formation [[cite:PUB00004198]]. A concentration of methionine residues at the core of the molecule could provide plasticity, relieving structural mismatches during assembly [[cite:PUB00004198]].</p>\r\n<p>The 3D structure of baculovirus-expressed core protein VP7 of African horse sickness virus 4 (AHSV-4) has been determined to 2.3A resolution [[cite:PUB00003521]]. During crystallisation, the two-domain protein is cleaved, leaving only the top domain, in a manner reminiscent of BTV VP7; this suggests that connections between top and bottom domains are relatively weak for these two distinct orbiviruses [[cite:PUB00003521]]. The top domains of both BTV and AHSV VP7 are trimeric and structurally very similar. Electron density maps indicate an extra density feature along their molecular 3-fold axes, probably the result of an unidentified ion [[cite:PUB00003521]]. The characteristics of the molecular surface indicate the possibility of attachment to the cell via attachment of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in the top domain of VP7 to a cellular integrin for both of these orbiviruses [[cite:PUB00003521]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008935", "name" "Virus capsid protein, alpha-helical", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023178", "name" "Orbivirus inner capsid protein VP7, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023176", "name" "Orbivirus inner capsid protein VP7, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00897" "Orbivirus inner capsid protein VP7"}, "prints" {"PR00903" "VP7CAPSID"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Orbivirus inner capsid protein VP7", "short" "Orbi_VP7_capsid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 667, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1006", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1006"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001803", :literature {"PUB00004198" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6510", "authors" ["Grimes J" "Basak AK" "Roy P" "Stuart D."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/373167a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "The crystal structure of bluetongue virus VP7.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "167-70", "volume" "373", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7816101}, "PUB00003521" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Basak AK" "Gouet P" "Grimes J" "Roy P" "Stuart D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
