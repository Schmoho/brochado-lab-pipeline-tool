{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The myelin sheath is a multi-layered membrane, unique to the nervous system, that functions as an insulator to greatly increase the velocity of axonal impulse conduction [[cite:PUB00002447]]. Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP or lipophilin) [[cite:PUB00003190]] is the major myelin protein from the central nervous system (CNS). It probably plays an important role in the formation or maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin. In man point mutations in PLP are the cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), a neurologic disorder of myelin metabolism. In animals dismyelinating diseases such as mouse 'jimpy' (jp), rat md, or dog 'shaking pup' are also caused by mutations in PLP.</p>\r\n<p>PLP is a highly conserved [[cite:PUB00000749]] hydrophobic protein of 276 to 280 amino acids which seems to contain four transmembrane segments, two disulphide bonds and which covalently binds lipids (at least six palmitate groups in mammals) [[cite:PUB00000360]].</p>\r\n<p>PLP is highly related to M6, a neuronal membran glycoprotein [[cite:PUB00004311]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11683" "MYELIN PROTEOLIPID"}, "smart" {"SM00002" "Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP or lipophilin)"}, "prints" {"PR00214" "MYELINPLP"}, "pfam" {"PF01275" "Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP or lipophilin)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myelin proteolipid protein PLP", "short" "Myelin_PLP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 1002, "taxa" 4152, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6101, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5918, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3895}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00497", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00497"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001614", :literature {"PUB00002447" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Sakamoto Y" "Kitamura K" "Yoshimura K" "Nishijima T" "Uyemura K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
