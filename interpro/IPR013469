{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ribonuclease Z (RNase Z) homologue, RNase BN, from bacteria. RNase BN was considered to be an exonuclease based on its ability to remove the 3'-terminal residue of tRNAs ending in CA, CU, CCU or even CCA [[cite:PUB00083319]]. In E. coli, even though different set of enzymes are used for tRNA 3'-ends processing and RNase Z is thought to be less important than the other ribonucleases. However, E. coli cells lacking the four main enzymes of the exonucleolytic pathway (RNases T, PH, D and II) are viable, whereas further mutation of RNase BN/Z in this genetic context causes an unviable phenotype [[cite:PUB00083321]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02649" "ribonuclease BN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease BN", "short" "Rnase_BN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 500, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 801, "sets" 0, "proteins" 801, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 637}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1360", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1360"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013469", :literature {"PUB00083321" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Reuven NB" "Deutscher MP."], "ISO_journal" "FASEB J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FASEB J", "title" "Multiple exoribonucleases are required for the 3' processing of Escherichia coli tRNA precursors in vivo.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "143-8", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8422961}, "PUB00083319" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Redko Y" "Li de la Sierra-Gallay I" "Condon C."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
