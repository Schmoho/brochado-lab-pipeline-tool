{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the elongation factor P--(R)-beta-lysine ligase (also known as EpmA). Together with EpmB, it is involved in the beta-lysylation step of the post-translational modification of translation elongation factor P (EF-P) [[cite:PUB00064725]]. It catalyses the ATP-dependent activation of (R)-beta-lysine produced by EpmB, forming a lysyl-adenylate, from which the beta-lysyl moiety is then transferred to the Îµ-amino group of a conserved specific lysine residue in EF-P. The protein may play a role in the modulation of virulence and drug resistance [[cite:PUB00064725], [cite:PUB00064726]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3g1z", "name" "Structure of IDP01693/yjeA, a potential t-RNA synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045864", "name" "Class II Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/Biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) and lipoyl protein ligase (LPL)", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00174" "Elongation factor P--(R)-beta-lysine ligase [epmA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00462" "EF-P lysine aminoacylase EpmA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Elongation factor P--(R)-beta-lysine ligase", "short" "EpmA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1739, "taxa" 8265, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8800, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8800, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6821}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0988", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0988"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
