{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins contain the major surface glycoprotein of turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), avian pneumovirus (APV), the aetiological agent of turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT), and other Metapneumoviruses. The major surface glycoprotein is the attachment (G) protein, which, by analogy with other respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), has been proposed to be responsible for virus binding to its cell receptor. The APV G gene and its predicted protein have several features in common with their RSV counterparts. Both G proteins are type II glycoproteins and both the RSV G and APV G proteins are heavily O-glycosylated. In both RSV and APV, the G protein is the most variable protein and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies [[cite:PUB00011548]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05539" "Pneumovirinae attachment membrane glycoprotein G"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pneumovirinae attachment membrane glycoprotein G", "short" "Pneumo_att_G"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 15, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 335, "sets" 0, "proteins" 335, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008781", :literature {"PUB00011548" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 11", "authors" ["Bayon-Auboyer MH" "Arnauld C" "Toquin D" "Eterradossi N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
