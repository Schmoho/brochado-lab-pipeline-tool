{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the toxic component HepT of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, which has RNase activity. These proteins contain a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain and are neutralized through tri-AMPylation by the cognate antitoxin MntA, containing a MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domain [[cite:PUB00097221], [cite:PUB00097219], [cite:PUB00097220]]. HepT-MnA form an heterooctamer (at a 2:6 ratio), a rare organisation for this kind of TA systems. HepT dimerises and enables the formation of a deep cleft at the HEPN-domain interface, containing the RX4-6H motif (where X is any amino acid and the residue immediately after the conserved R is typically a polar amino acid) as the active site that functions as an RNA-cleaving RNase. This type II TA system regulates cell motility and confers plasmid stability [[cite:PUB00097219]]. Due to the prevalence of these HEPN/MNT modules in bacteria and archaea, it has been suggested that these TA systems may also play a role in the environmental adaptation to extreme habitats [[cite:PUB00097220]]. This family also includes uncharacterised putative RNases from bacteria and archaea.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ae6", "name" "Crystal structure of di-AMPylated HEPN(R102A) toxin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037038", "name" "tRNA nuclease HepT-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01934" "Ribonuclease HepT-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease HepT-like", "short" "HepT-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 47, "proteomes" 2635, "taxa" 13813, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25075, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25072, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19034}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
