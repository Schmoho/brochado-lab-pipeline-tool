Most use succinyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA as CoA donors.</li>\n<li>Family II consists of the homodimeric alpha-subunits of citrate lyase and citramalate lyase ([ec:2.8.3.10], [ec:2.8.3.11]). These enzymes catalyse the transfer of acyl carrier protein (ACP) with a covalently bound CoA derivative, but can accept free CoA thioesters as well.</li>\n<li>Family III consists of formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00031320]], succinyl-CoA:(R)-benzylsuccinate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00035619]], (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA:(R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00035620]], succinyl-CoA:mesaconate CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00093662]] and butyrobetainyl-CoA:(R)-carnitine CoA-transferase [[cite:PUB00032440]].
