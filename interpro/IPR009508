{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic Churchill proteins. This protein contains a novel zinc binding region that mediates FGF signalling during neural development. The slow induction by FGF of a transcription factor (Churchill) in the neural plate in turn induces expression of Sip1 (Smad interacting protein-1), which inhibits mesodermal genes and sensitizes cells to later neural inducing factors [[cite:PUB00014964]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038543", "name" "Churchill superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31931" "PROTEIN CHURCHILL"}, "pfam" {"PF06573" "Churchill protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription activator, Churchill", "short" "Transcrpt_activator_Churchill"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 635, "taxa" 2437, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 998, "sets" 0, "proteins" 991, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 695}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009508", :literature {"PUB00014964" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Akai J" "Storey K."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00936-X", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Brain or brawn: how FGF signaling gives us both.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "510-2", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14651843}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007275", "name" "multicellular organism development", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045893", "name" "positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009508", "name" "Transcription activator, Churchill", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 782}}}
