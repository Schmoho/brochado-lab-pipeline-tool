{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Receptor for retinol uptake STRA6 (also known as \"stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 protein\") is a multitransmembrane domain protein, which acts as a retinol transporter for the complex retinol-retinol binding protein (RBP/RBP4). It acts by removing retinol (vitamin A) from RBP/RBP4 and transports it across the plasma membrane, where it can be metabolised. This mechanism does not depend on endocytosis [[cite:PUB00060821]].</p>\n\n<p>Vitamin A and its derivatives are essential for vision and many other biological processes. In humans, defects in STRA6 are the cause of microphthalmia syndromic type 9 (MCOPS9); also called Matthew-Wood syndrome or Spear syndrome. Microphthalmia is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of eye formation, ranging from small size of a single eye to complete bilateral absence of ocular tissues (anophthalmia). In many cases, microphthalmia/anophthalmia occurs in association with syndromes that include non-ocular abnormalities. MCOPS9 is a rare clinical entity including as main characteristics anophthalmia or severe microphthalmia, and pulmonary hypoplasia or aplasia [[cite:PUB00060822], [cite:PUB00060823], [cite:PUB00060824]].</p>\n\n<p>In addition to serving as a retinol transporter, STRA6 is a ligand-activated cell surface signalling receptor that activates JAK/STAT signalling upon binding to the retinol-RBP complex [[cite:PUB00088337]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5k8q", "name" "Crystal Structure of Calcium-loaded Calmodulin in complex with STRA6 CaMBP2-site peptide."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14752" "Retinol binding protein receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor for retinol uptake STRA6-like", "short" "STRA6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 714, "taxa" 2630, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4185, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3533, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2150}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026612", :literature {"PUB00088337" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Noy N."], "ISO_journal" "Subcell.
