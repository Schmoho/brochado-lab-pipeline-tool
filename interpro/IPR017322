{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIP2), which functions in the phosphorylation ([ec:2.7.11.1]) of its protein target. This enzyme activates pro-caspase-1 and pro-caspase-8, and it thought to potentiate CASP8-mediated apoptosis [[cite:PUB00044623]]. It also activates NF-kappa-B. RIP2 undergoes autophosphorylation; it is phosphorylated upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037921" "Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2", "short" "Rcpt-int_Ser/Thr_kinase-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 907, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 334, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 245}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
