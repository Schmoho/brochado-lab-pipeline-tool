{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AP endonucleases can be classified into two families based on sequence similarity. This family contains members of AP endonuclease family 1. They are endonucleases that remove the damaged DNA at cytosines and guanines by cleaving on the 3'-side of the AP site by a beta-elimination reaction [[cite:PUB00004207], [cite:PUB00094227]]. The proteins contain glutamate which has been shown [[cite:PUB00004207]] in the Escherichia coli enzyme to bind a divalent metal ion such as magnesium or manganese.</p>\n\n<p>DNA damaging agents such as the anti-tumour drugs bleomycin and neocarzinostatin or those that generate oxygen radicals produce a variety of lesions in DNA. Amongst these is base-loss which forms apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites or strand breaks with atypical 3' termini. DNA repair at the AP sites is initiated by specific endonuclease cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone. Such endonucleases are also generally capable of removing blocking groups from the 3' terminus of DNA strand breaks.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ako", "name" "EXONUCLEASE III FROM ESCHERICHIA COLI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036691", "name" "Endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00633" "exodeoxyribonuclease III"}, "profile" {"PS51435" "AP endonucleases family 1 profile"}, "panther" {"PTHR22748" "AP ENDONUCLEASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AP endonuclease 1", "short" "AP_endonuc_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 125, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10746, "taxa" 40605, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 65325, "sets" 0, "proteins" 65304, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 48503}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
