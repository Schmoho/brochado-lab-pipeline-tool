{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family have a conserved nucleotide-binding motif GXXGXGKT and a nucleotide-binding fold. Member protein YjeE of Haemophilus influenzae (HI0065) was shown to have ATPase activity [[cite:PUB00016159], [cite:PUB00063361]]. The protein has a nucleotide-binding fold with a four-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by antiparallel β-strands on each side. The topology of the β-sheet is unique among P-loop proteins and has features of different families of enzymes. ADP has been shown to bind to the P-loop in the presence of Mg2+.</p>\r\n<p>Recently YjeE has been renamed as TsaE [[cite:PUB00063355]]. It is responsible for tRNA threonylcarbamoyl adenosine modification together with proteins TsaB, TsaC, and TsaD, and probably forms a complex with them [[cite:PUB00063355], [cite:PUB00063366]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1htw", "name" "COMPLEX OF HI0065 WITH ADP AND MAGNESIUM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00150" "tRNA (adenosine(37)-N6)-threonylcarbamoyltransferase complex ATPase subunit type 1 TsaE"}, "pfam" {"PF02367" "Threonylcarbamoyl adenosine biosynthesis protein TsaE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA threonylcarbamoyl adenosine modification protein TsaE", "short" "T6A_TsaE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 81, "proteomes" 9206, "taxa" 36519, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42692, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32644}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1171", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1171"} {"accession" "GenProp1060", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1060"} {"accession" "GenProp1570", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1570"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003442", :literature {"PUB00016159" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Teplyakov A" "Obmolova G" "Tordova M" "Thanki N" "Bonander N" "Eisenstein E" "Howard AJ" "Gilliland GL."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10114", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of the YjeE protein from Haemophilus influenzae: a putative Atpase involved in cell wall synthesis.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "220-6", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12112691}, "PUB00063366" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Lauhon CT."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi301233d", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Mechanism of N6-Threonylcarbamoyladenonsine (t(6)A) Biosynthesis: Isolation and Characterization of the Intermediate Threonylcarbamoyl-AMP.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "8950-63", "volume" "51", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23072323}, "PUB00063361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lerner CG" "Hajduk PJ" "Wagner R" "Wagenaar FL" "Woodall C" "Gu YG" "Searle XB" "Florjancic AS" "Zhang T" "Clark RF" "Cooper CS" "Mack JC" "Yu L" "Cai M" "Betz SF" "Chovan LE" "McCall JO" "Black-Schaefer CL" "Kakavas SJ" "Schurdak ME" "Comess KM" "Walter KA" "Edalji R" "Dorwin SA" "Smith RA" "Hebert EJ" "Harlan JE" "Metzger RE" "Merta PJ" "Baranowski JL" "Coen ML" "Thornewell SJ" "Shivakumar AG" "Saiki AY" "Soni N" "Bui M" "Balli DJ" "Sanders WJ" "Nilius AM" "Holzman TF" "Fesik SW" "Beutel BA."], "ISO_journal" "Chem Biol Drug Des", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2007.00521.x", "medline_journal" "Chem Biol Drug Des", "title" "From bacterial genomes to novel antibacterial agents: discovery, characterization, and antibacterial activity of compounds that bind to HI0065 (YjeE) from Haemophilus influenzae.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "395-404", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17581233}, "PUB00063355" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Deutsch C" "El Yacoubi B" "de Crecy-Lagard V" "Iwata-Reuyl D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
