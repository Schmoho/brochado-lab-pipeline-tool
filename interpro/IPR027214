{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of a group of cysteine protease inhibitors (also known as cystatins). They can be classified as [[cite:PUB00063214]]:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Type 1: intracellular cystatins, but may also appear in significant amounts in body fluids [[cite:PUB00063215]]. They are single-chain polypeptides of about 100 residues, which have neither disulphide bonds nor carbohydrate side chains. Type 1 cystatin includes cystatin-A/B.</li>\n<li>Type 2: extracellular secreted polypeptides synthesised with a 19-28 residue signal peptide. They are broadly distributed and found in most body fluids [[cite:PUB00063215]]. Type 2 cyctatin includes cystatin-C/D/M/F/SA/SN/G.</li>\n<li>Type 3: multidomain cystatins, including kininogens, known as kinin precursor proteins [[cite:PUB00063216]]. There are three different kininogens in mammals: H- (high molecular mass, [interpro:IPR002395]) and L- (low molecular mass) kininogen which are found in a number of species, and T-kininogen that is found only in rat.</li>\n<li>Unclassified cystatins: cystatin-like proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This entry represents the type1, type2 and cystatin-like proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6swt", "name" "Affimer9 co-crystalised with the CH domains of alpha actinin 2."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046350", "name" "Cystatin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47116" "PHLOEM FILAMENT PROTEIN", "PTHR11413" "CYSTATIN FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cystatin", "short" "Cystatin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 260, "taxa" 1174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3299, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3299, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2058}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027214", :literature {"PUB00063216" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Ohkubo I" "Kurachi K" "Takasawa T" "Shiokawa H" "Sasaki M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00319a005", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Isolation of a human cDNA for alpha 2-thiol proteinase inhibitor and its identity with low molecular weight kininogen.", "year" 1984, "raw_pages" "5691-7", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6441591}, "PUB00063215" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Abrahamson M" "Barrett AJ" "Salvesen G" "Grubb A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
