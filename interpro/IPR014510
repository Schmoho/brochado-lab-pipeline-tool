{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this group are stand-alone YeaR proteins, the predication is based on domain association, and is known to be involved in tellurite resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tellurite resistance protein TehB is encoded by the tellurite-reducing operon<i>tehAB</i> [[cite:PUB00027707]]. TehB exists in a two-domain form ([interpro:IPR014431]) with a C-terminal SAM-dependent methyltransferase domain and an N-terminal domain of unknown function; and in the form of two stand-alone proteins: YeaR protein (this group) and single-domain TehB methyltransferase ([interpro:IPR004537]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When upregulated or present in high copy number, TehB of Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for potassium tellurite resistance, this is achieved by increasing the reduction rate of tellurite to metallic tellurium within the bacterium. TehB is a cytoplasmic protein that possesses three conserved motifs (I, II, and III) found in S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent non-nucleic acid methyltransferases [[cite:PUB00014885]]. Conformational changes in TehB are observed upon binding of both tellurite and SAM, suggesting that TehB utilises a methyltransferase activity in the detoxification of tellurite [[cite:PUB00027741]].</p>\n\n<p>The role of YeaR protein and of the corresponding domain in two-domain TehB in tellurite resistance is not known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF020632" "Predicted tellurite resistance protein YeaR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tellurite resistance predicted, YeaR", "short" "Tellurite-R_YeaR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 97, "taxa" 1119, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1719, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1719, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1320}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014510", :literature {"PUB00027707" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Liu M" "Taylor DE."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
