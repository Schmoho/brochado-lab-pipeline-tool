{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzymes. Branching enzymes (BEs) generally belong to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13); however this group belongs to the GH57 family. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of branch points in alpha-glucans by cleavage of an alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond and subsequent transfer of the cleaved-off oligosaccharide to a new alpha-1,6 position [[cite:PUB00090452], [cite:PUB00090453]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n98", "name" "Crystal structure of TK1436, a GH57 branching enzyme from hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis, in complex with glucose and additives"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037090", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase families 57, central domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027291", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase 38, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR41695" "1,4-ALPHA-GLUCAN BRANCHING ENZYME RV3031-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme MT3115-like", "short" "Branching_enz_MT3115-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 986, "taxa" 5295, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5920, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5920, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4506}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
