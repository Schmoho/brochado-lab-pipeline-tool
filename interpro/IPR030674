{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents nudix hydrolases, AtNUDT22 and AtNUDT15, from Arabidopsis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nudix superfamily is widespread among eucaryotes, bacteria, archaea and viruses and consists mainly of pyrophosphohydrolases that act upon substrates of general structure NUcleoside DIphosphate linked to another moiety, X (NDP-X) to yield NMP plus P-X. Such substrates include (d)NTPs (both canonical and oxidised derivatives), nucleotide sugars and alcohols, dinucleoside polyphosphates (NpnN), dinucleotide coenzymes and capped RNAs. However, phosphohydrolase activity, including activity towards NDPs themselves, and non-nucleotide substrates such as diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (DIPs), 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and dihydroneopterin triphosphate (DHNTP) have also been described. Some superfamily members, such as Escherichia coli mutT, have the ability to degrade potentially mutagenic, oxidised nucleotides while others control the levels of metabolic intermediates and signalling compounds. In procaryotes and simple eucaryotes, the number of Nudix genes varies from 0 to over 30, reflecting the metabolic complexity and adaptability of the organism. Nudix hydrolases are typically small proteins, larger ones having additional domains with interactive or other catalytic functions [[cite:PUB00034750]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038132" "Nudix hydrolase, AtNUDT22 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nudix hydrolase, AtNUDT22-type", "short" "Nudix_hydrolase_AtNUDT22"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 24, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
