Alpha-amylase is an essential enzyme in alpha-glucan metabolism, acting to catalyse the hydrolysis of alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of glycogen, starch and related polysaccharides. Although all alpha-amylases possess the same catalytic function, they can vary with respect to sequence.  In general, they are composed of three domains: a TIM barrel containing the active site residues and chloride ion-binding site (domain A), a long loop region inserted between the third β-strand and the α-helix of domain A that contains calcium-binding site(s) (domain B), and a C-terminal β-sheet domain that appears to show some variability in sequence and length between amylases (domain C) [[cite:PUB00027666]]. Amylases have at least one conserved calcium-binding site, as calcium is essential for the stability of the enzyme. The chloride-binding functions to activate the enzyme, which acts by a two-step mechanism involving a catalytic nucleophile base (usually an Asp) and a catalytic proton donor (usually a Glu) that are responsible for the formation of the beta-linked glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents a subfamily of alpha-amylase proteins that are found in plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ht6", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE AT 1.5A RESOLUTION OF THE BARLEY ALPHA-AMYLASE ISOZYME 1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001028" "Alpha-amylase, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-amylase, plant", "short" "A-amylase_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 943, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1324, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1291, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 834}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
