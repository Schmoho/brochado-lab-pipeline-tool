{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Germins (also known as Oxalate oxidases) and germin-like proteins [[cite:PUB00001527]] are a family of hexameric ubiquitous plant glycoproteins. They are not restricted to germinating grains as initially sought and thereof called 'germins', but they exist in all organs and developmental stages. All are at least partly associated with the extracellular matrix.</p>\n\n<p>A wide range of function has been uncovered for germins and germin-like proteins: some act as oxalate oxidases ([ec:1.2.3.4]) or as superoxide dismutase ([ec:1.15.1.1]), while others seem to be structural proteins or receptors for auxins or proteins. Germin catalyses the manganese-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of oxalate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [[cite:PUB00014173], [cite:PUB00102246], [cite:PUB00040428]]. It is widespread in fungi and various plant tissues and may play a role in plant signaling and defense.</p>\n\n<p>Germins and germin-like proteins are highly similar to slime mold spherulins 1a and 1b which are proteins that accumulate specifically during spherulation, a process induced by various forms of environmental stress which leads to encystment and dormancy.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fi2", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF GERMIN (OXALATE OXIDASE)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02241" "Oxalate oxidase (germin), cupin domain"}, "prints" {"PR00325" "GERMIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Germin", "short" "Germin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 927, "taxa" 3117, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18956, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17727, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10335}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00597", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00597"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
