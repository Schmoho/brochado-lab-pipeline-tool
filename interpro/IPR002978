{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) transport mechanisms are the principal regulators of pH in animal cells. Such transport also plays a vital role in acid-base movements in the stomach, pancreas, intestine, kidney, reproductive organs and the central nervous system. Functional studies have suggested four different HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>transport modes. Anion exchanger proteins exchange HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>for Cl<sup>-</sup>in a reversible, electroneutral manner [[cite:PUB00005997]]. Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transport proteins mediate the coupled movement of Na<sup>+</sup>and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>across plasma membranes, often in an electrogenic manner [[cite:PUB00018713]]. Na<sup>+</sup>driven Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>exchange and K<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>exchange activities have also been detected in certain cell types, although the molecular identities of the proteins responsible remain to be determined.</p>\n\n<p>Sequence analysis of the two families of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>transporters that have been cloned to date (the anion exchangers and Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporters) reveals that they are homologous. This is not entirely unexpected, given that they both transport HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>and are inhibited by a class of pharmacological agents called disulphonic stilbenes [[cite:PUB00006023]]. They share around ~25-30% sequence identity, which is distributed along their entire sequence length, and have similar predicted membrane topologies, suggesting they have ~10 transmembrane (TM) domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Anion exchange proteins participate in pH and cell volume regulation. They are glycosylated, plasma-membrane transport proteins that exchange hydrogen carbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) for chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) in a reversible, electroneutral manner [[cite:PUB00005997], [cite:PUB00005998]]. To date three anion exchanger isoforms have been identified (AE1-3), AE1 being the previously-characterised erythrocyte band 3 protein. They share a predicted topology of 12-14 transmembrane (TM) domains, but have differing distribution patterns and cellular localisation. The best characterised isoform, AE1, is known to be the most abundant membrane protein in mature erythrocytes. It has a molecular mass of ~95kDa and consists of two major domains. The N-terminal 390 residues form a water-soluble, highly elongated domain that serves as an attachment site for the binding of the membrane skeleton and other cytoplasmic proteins. The remainder of the protein is a 55kDa hydrophobic domain that is responsible for catalysing anion exchange. The function of the analogous domains of AE2 and AE3 remains to be determined [[cite:PUB00005999]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>AE2 (~1240 amino acids) is a non-erythroid anion exchanger.

Three AE2 N-terminal variants have been described, arising due to the presence of alternative promoter sites within the gene. They are referred to as AE2a-c and have differing distribution patterns: AE2a is expressed in all tissues; AE2b exhibits a more restricted distribution, with highest levels in the stomach; and AE2c is expressed only in the stomach [[cite:PUB00006002]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016152", "name" "Phosphotransferase/anion transporter", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01188" "ANIONEXHNGR2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anion exchange protein 2", "short" "Anion_exchange_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 151, "taxa" 572, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1829, "sets" 0, "proteins" 490, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 253}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002978", :literature {"PUB00005997" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kopito RR."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
