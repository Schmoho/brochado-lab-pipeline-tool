{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a family of small cytosolic proteins, about 80 amino acids in length, in which the eight invariant residues include three His residues and two Cys residues. Two pairs of these invariant residues occur in motifs HxH (where x is A or G) and CxH, both of which suggest metal-binding activity. This protein family was identified by searching with a phylogenetic profile based on an anaerobic sulphatase-maturase enzyme, which contains multiple 4Fe-4S clusters. The linkages by phylogenetic profiling and by iron-sulphur cluster-related motifs together suggest this protein may be an accessory protein to certain maturases in sulphatase/maturase systems.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03853" "YecH family metal-binding protein"}, "pfam" {"PF10678" "Protein of unknown function (DUF2492)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative metal-binding protein", "short" "Metal-bd_prot_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 228, "taxa" 1721, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1638, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1638, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1259}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019620", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019620", "name" "Putative metal-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 21, "alignment:full" 219}}}
