{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents nucleoid occlusion proteins belonging to the parB family. Nucleoid occlusion protein effects nucleoid occlusion by binding relatively nonspecifically to DNA and preventing the assembly of the division machinery in the vicinity of the nucleoid, especially under conditions that disturb the cell cycle. It helps to coordinate cell division and chromosome segregation by preventing the formation of the Z ring through the nucleoid, which would cause chromosome breakage [[cite:PUB00054946]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02015" "Nucleoid occlusion protein [noc]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04285" "nucleoid occlusion protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoid occlusion protein", "short" "Nucleoid_occlusion_protein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 891, "taxa" 2876, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2584, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1994}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023705", :literature {"PUB00054946" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wu LJ" "Errington J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2004.06.002", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Coordination of cell division and chromosome segregation by a nucleoid occlusion protein in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "915-25", "volume" "117", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15210112}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023705", "name" "Nucleoid occlusion protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
