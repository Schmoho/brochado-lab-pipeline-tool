{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glucosyltransferase 3 (also known as Glucosyltransferase C, GtfC) catalyses the second step of glycosylation of Serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (SRRPs) in Gram-positive bacteria and transfers glucosyl residues to GlcNAc-modified SRRPs. SRRPs have been first identified in pathogenic bacteria but they are also in gut commensal bacteria. These proteins are O-glycosylated on serine or threonine residues to be exported via an specialised accessory secretion (SecA2/Y2) system. This secretion system is encoded in a gene cluster that includes the motor protein SecA2, the channel SecY2 and three to five accessory Sec proteins, but it also contains genes encoding a variable number of glycosyltransferases (GTs), among them Gft3 [[cite:PUB00094451], [cite:PUB00094452], [cite:PUB00064837]].</p>\n<p>Structural analysis revealed that Gft3 forms a tetramer and has structural homology with other glycosyltransferases. The conserved residues Phe315 and Leu320 at the C-terminal are critical for oligomerisation and UDP- or UDP-glucose binding. Gft3 homologs constitutes a unique subfamiliy of glycosyltransferases as they are highly conserved and only found in SRRP-containing bacteria [[cite:PUB00094454]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rhz", "name" "Structure and functional analysis of a new subfamily of glycosyltransferases required for glycosylation of serine-rich streptococcal adhesions"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00841" "Glucosyltransferase 3 [gtf3]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucosyltransferase 3", "short" "Gtf3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 265, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 407, "sets" 0, "proteins" 407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 313}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
