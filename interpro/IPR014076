{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4A (also known as carboxysome operon protein orfA). It distinguishes one of the two closely related paralogs encoded by nearby genes in the carboxysome operons of a number of cyanobacteria and chemoautotrophic bacteria. More distantly related proteins are components of other shells, for example, the ethanolamine utilization protein EutN/carboxysome structural protein Ccml of the ethanolamine degradation organelle of Nitrobacter hamburgensis. This protein, together with CsoS4B, forms vertices in the carboxysome [[cite:PUB00096632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b12", "name" "cryo-EM structure of carboxysomal mini-shell: icosahedral assembly from CsoS4A/1A and CsoS2 co-expression (T = 9)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036677", "name" "EutN/Ccml superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02703" "carboxysome peptide A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4A", "short" "CsoS4A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 589, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 414, "sets" 0, "proteins" 414, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 352}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014076", :literature {"PUB00096632" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Cai F" "Menon BB" "Cannon GC" "Curry KJ" "Shively JM" "Heinhorst S."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The pentameric vertex proteins are necessary for the icosahedral carboxysome shell to function as a CO2 leakage barrier.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e7521", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19844578}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0031469", "name" "bacterial microcompartment", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004992", "name" "Ethanolamine utilization protein EutN/carboxysome shell vertex protein CcmL", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR014076", "name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4A", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR014077", "name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CsoS4B", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR046387", "name" "Carboxysome shell vertex protein CcmL", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
