RibL is, currently, the only identified archaeal FAD synthase [[cite:PUB00056773]]. This protein is not related to the eukarytoic or bacterial enzymes and contains no known motifs for FMN or FAD binding, suggesting that it contains a novel flavin binding site. Unlike most other FAD synthases, RibL does not catalyse the reverse reaction to produce FMN and ATP from FAD.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3glv", "name" "Crystal structure of the lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis protein from Thermoplasma volcanium GSS1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02115" "FAD synthase [ribL]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAD synthase RibL", "short" "FAD_synth_RibL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 204, "taxa" 1346, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1258, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1258, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1089}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
