{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a disulphide-bonded heterodimer consisting of a 35kDa alpha subunit and a 40kDa beta subunit. It is involved in the stimulation and maintenance of Th1 cellular immune responses, including the normal host defence against various intracellular pathogens, such as Leishmania, Toxoplasma, Measles virus and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV). IL-12 also has an important role in pathological Th1 responses, such as in inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Suppression of IL-12 activity in such diseases may have therapeutic benefit. On the other hand, administration of recombinant IL-12 may have therapeutic benefit in conditions associated with pathological Th2 responses [[cite:PUB00007461], [cite:PUB00007462]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents interleukin-12 alpha.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03039" "Interleukin-12 alpha subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-12 alpha", "short" "IL-12_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 347, "taxa" 1407, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 728, "sets" 0, "proteins" 723, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 493}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004281", :literature {"PUB00007461" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Park AY" "Scott P."], "ISO_journal" "Scand.
