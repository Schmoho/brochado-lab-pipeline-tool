{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins comprise a family of vertebrate amphipathic Î±-helical apolipoproteins that associate predominantly with high density lipoproteins (HDL) [[cite:PUB00000177], [cite:PUB00001955]]. They play a role in the mobilisation of cholesterol for tissue repair and regeneration [[cite:PUB00095064]]. The synthesis of these proteins is greatly increased (as much as a 1000 fold) in inflammation, being a major acute phase reactant together with C-reactive protein. They act as cytokine-like proteins that are involved in cell-cell communication and in inflammatory, immunologic, neoplastic and protective pathways [[cite:PUB00095063]]. Prolonged elevation of plasma SAA levels, as in chronic inflammation, results in a pathological condition, called amyloidosis, which affects the liver, kidney and spleen and which is characterised by the highly insoluble accumulation of SAA in these tissues. During chronic inflammation, SAA association with HDL can change its protein and lipid composition which abrogates the HDL anti-atherogenic properties, contributing to a pro-atherogenic state [[cite:PUB00095064], [cite:PUB00095063]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6pxz", "name" "Crystal Structure of mouse Serum Amyloid A3 (SAA3) in the trimeric form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00992" "Serum amyloid A proteins signature"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002472" "Amyloid protein, SAA type"}, "smart" {"SM00197" "Serum amyloid A proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF00277" "Serum amyloid A protein"}, "prints" {"PR00306" "SERUMAMYLOID"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serum amyloid A protein", "short" "Serum_amyloid_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 29, "proteomes" 602, "taxa" 2352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1658, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1620, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1113}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00762", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00762"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000096", :literature {"PUB00000177" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Malle E" "Steinmetz A" "Raynes JG."], "ISO_journal" "Atherosclerosis", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0021-9150(93)90155-N", "medline_journal" "Atherosclerosis", "title" "Serum amyloid A (SAA): an acute phase protein and apolipoprotein.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "131-46", "volume" "102", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7504491}, "PUB00001955" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Uhlar CM" "Burgess CJ" "Sharp PM" "Whitehead AS."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.1994.1052", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Evolution of the serum amyloid A (SAA) protein superfamily.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "228-35", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8188253}, "PUB00095063" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sack GH Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
