{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents inducible mutagenesis protein A (ImuA), believed to be involved in DNA damage tolerance in a number of bacteria. This protein is often encoded in a operon with DnaE2 (a second copy of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III), and ImuB (whose function is not known though it is similar to the Y-family of DNA polymerases), though the genes may also be encoded in separate regions. In Caulobacter crescentus (Caulobacter vibrioides) the imuAB/dnaE2 operon is induced by DNA damage in a RecA-dependent manner and is required for the error-prone processing of DNA lesions [[cite:PUB00042658]]. Strains deficient in these genes showed extreme sensitivity to mutagenic agents such as UV or the drug mitC. The function of ImuA is not known but sequence analysis suggests that it contains a P-loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF034285" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP034285 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inducible mutagenesis protein A", "short" "ImuA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 732, "taxa" 2555, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3183, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3169, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2615}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017026", :literature {"PUB00042658" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Galhardo RS" "Rocha RP" "Marques MV" "Menck CF."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki551", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "An SOS-regulated operon involved in damage-inducible mutagenesis in Caulobacter crescentus.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2603-14", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15886391}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017026", "name" "Inducible mutagenesis protein A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
