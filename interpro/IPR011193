{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is composed of ornithine decarboxylases (ODC), arginine decarboxylases (ADC) and lysine decarboxylases (LDC), and belongs to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aspartate aminotransferase domain superfamily (fold I) [[cite:PUB00001452]]. These enzymes catalyse the decarboxylation of ornithine, arginine, or lysine, respectively using PLP as a co-factor. ODC is active as a dimer and catalyses the decarboxylation of tryptophan [[cite:PUB00014437]]. ADC catalyses the decarboxylation of arginine and LDC catalyses the decarboxylation of lysine. The PLP combines with the alpha-amino acid to form a Schiff base, which acts as the substrate in the decarboxylation (COOH group removal) reaction [[cite:PUB00014393]].</p>\n\n<p>Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes were previously classified into alpha, beta and gamma classes, based on the chemical characteristics (carbon atom involved) of the reaction they catalysed. The availability of several structures allowed a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary classification of PLP dependent enzymes, and it was found that the functional classification did not always agree with the evolutionary history of these enzymes. Structure and sequence analysis has revealed that the PLP dependent enzymes can be classified into four major groups of different evolutionary origin: aspartate aminotransferase superfamily (fold type I), tryptophan synthase beta superfamily (fold type II), alanine racemase superfamily (fold type III), D-amino acid superfamily (fold type IV) and glycogen phophorylase family (fold type V) [[cite:PUB00006301], [cite:PUB00006322]].</p>\n\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00014378], [cite:PUB00014382]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n75", "name" "X-ray Crystal Structure of the Escherichia coli Inducible Lysine Decarboxylase LdcI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027464", "name" "Ornithine decarboxylase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45229" "CONSTITUTIVE ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009393" "Ornithine/lysine/arginine decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ornithine/lysine/arginine decarboxylase", "short" "Orn/lys/arg_de-COase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1374, "taxa" 6906, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12819, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12812, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10084}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
