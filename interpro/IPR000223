{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of serine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family S26 (signal peptidase I family, clan SF), subfamily S26A.</p>\n\n<p>At least 3 eubacterial leader peptidases are known: murein prelipoprotein peptidase, which cleaves the leader peptide from a component of the bacterial outer membrane; type IV prepilin leader peptidase; and the serine-dependent leader peptidase 1, which has the more general role of cleaving the leader peptide from a variety of secreted proteins and proteins directed to the periplasm and periplasmic membrane [[cite:PUB00003576]]. Leader peptidase 1 is similar to the eukaryotic signal peptidase, although the bacterial protein is monomeric, while the eukaryotic protein is multimeric [[cite:PUB00003576]].</p>\n\n<p>Mitochondria contain a similar two-subunit serine protease that removes leader peptides from nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins, which localise in the inner mitochondrial space [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The catalytic residues of a number of these peptides have been identified as a serine/lysine dyad [[cite:PUB00003576]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4k8w", "name" "An arm-swapped dimer of the S. pyogenes pilin specific assembly factor SipA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036286", "name" "LexA/Signal peptidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR019766", "name" "Signal peptidase I, all-beta subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02227" "signal peptidase I"}, "panther" {"PTHR43390" "SIGNAL PEPTIDASE I"}, "prints" {"PR00727" "LEADERPTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S26A, signal peptidase I", "short" "Pept_S26A_signal_pept_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11625, "taxa" 45216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 92771, "sets" 0, "proteins" 82026, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 60956}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00418", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00418"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
