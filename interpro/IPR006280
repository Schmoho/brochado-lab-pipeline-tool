{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences represent the gamma subunit of a family of known and putative heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidases. Five operons of such oxidases are found in Rhizobium loti (Mesorhizobium loti) and three in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a high enough copy number to suggest that not all members share the same function. The gamma subunit is the most divergent between operons of the four subunits. Sarcosine oxidase catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to glycine. The reaction converts tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate [[cite:PUB00033240]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2gag", "name" "Heteroteterameric sarcosine: structure of a diflavin metaloenzyme at 1.85 a resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027266", "name" "GTP-binding protein TrmE/Aminomethyltransferase GcvT, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01375" "sarcosine oxidase subunit gamma family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sarcosine oxidase, gamma subunit, heterotetrameric", "short" "SoxG_het"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 309, "taxa" 1853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2275, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2275, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1866}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
