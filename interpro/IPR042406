{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit VKORC1 and VKORC1L1 mostly from animals.</p>\n\n<p>VKORC1 is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and vitamin K to vitamin K hydroquinone, an essential co-factor subsequently used in the Î³-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in blood coagulation enzymes [[cite:PUB00092943], [cite:PUB00016407]]. All homologues of VKOR contain an active site CXXC motif, which is switched between reduced and disulfide-bonded states during the reaction cycle [[cite:PUB00092945]]. Warfarin, a widely used oral anticoagulant used in medicine as well as rodenticides, inhibits the activity of VKOR, resulting in decreased levels of reduced vitamin K, which is required for the function of several clotting factors [[cite:PUB00057396]]. However, anticoagulation effect of warfarin is significantly associated with polymorphism of certain genes, including VKORC1. Interestingly, in rodents, an adaptive trait appears to have evolved convergently by selection on new or standing genetic polymorphisms in VKORC1 as well as by adaptive introgressive hybridization between species, likely brought about by human-mediated dispersal [[cite:PUB00092944]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038354", "name" "VKOR domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14519" "VITAMIN K EPOXIDE REDUCTASE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 1"}, "cdd" {"cd12917" "Vitamin K epoxide reductase family in eukaryotes, excluding plants"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1", "short" "VKORC1/VKORC1L1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 960, "taxa" 4083, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2458, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2456, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1708}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
