{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes PAMP-induced secreted peptide 2 (PIP2) and PAMP-INDUCED PEPTIDE-LIKE 1 (PIPL1, also known as CEP16 or PREPIPL1) from Arabidopsis, which are part of the PIP/PIPL family [[cite:PUB00090785], [cite:PUB00096868]]. These secreted proteins contain two conserved core SGPS motifs at the C terminus and the GxGH motif at the extreme C terminus [[cite:PUB00096868]]. The double peptide motif might be processed into two different peptides or, alternatively, may act as a functional unit, being able to interact with distinct binding sites resulting in the activation of different pathways. PIP2 is involved in innate immune and stress responses. It also acts as a negative regulator of root growth [[cite:PUB00090785]]. PIPL1 is involved in seed development and was also induced by stress [[cite:PUB00096868]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34663" "OS06G0637400 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PIP2/PIPL1", "short" "PIP2/PIPL1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 169, "taxa" 677, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 922, "sets" 0, "proteins" 922, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 538}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044700", :literature {"PUB00090785" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hou S" "Wang X" "Chen D" "Yang X" "Wang M" "Turra D" "Di Pietro A" "Zhang W."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004331", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "The secreted peptide PIP1 amplifies immunity through receptor-like kinase 7.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e1004331", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25188390}, "PUB00096868" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Vie AK" "Najafi J" "Liu B" "Winge P" "Butenko MA" "Hornslien KS" "Kumpf R" "Aalen RB" "Bones AM" "Brembu T."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "The IDA/IDA-LIKE and PIP/PIP-LIKE gene families in Arabidopsis: phylogenetic relationship, expression patterns, and transcriptional effect of the PIPL3 peptide.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "5351-65", "volume" "66", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26062745}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045087", "name" "innate immune response", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0050793", "name" "regulation of developmental process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044700", "name" "PIP2/PIPL1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
