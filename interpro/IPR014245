{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the stage III sporulation protein AF (SpoIIIAF) of the bacterial endospore formation program, which exists in some but not all members of the Firmicutes (formerly called low-GC Gram-positives). These proteins have the typical RBM fold conserved in T3SS/flagellar systems [1]. The RBM fold of SpoIIIAF contains two unique features, extended N-terminal helix, associated with multimerization and an insertion at a loop region that can adopt two distinct conformations [[cite:PUB00155401]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02896" "stage III sporulation protein AF"}, "pfam" {"PF09581" "Stage III sporulation protein AF (Spore_III_AF)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation stage III, protein AF", "short" "Spore_III_AF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 1027, "taxa" 3201, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3141, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3136, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2329}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014245", :literature {"PUB00155401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zeytuni N" "Flanagan KA" "Worrall LJ" "Massoni SC" "Camp AH" "Strynadka NCJ."], "ISO_journal" "J Struct Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2018.06.002", "medline_journal" "J Struct Biol", "title" "Structural and biochemical characterization of SpoIIIAF, a component of a sporulation-essential channel in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1-8", "volume" "204", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29886194}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014245", "name" "Sporulation stage III, protein AF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 71, "alignment:full" 1048}}}
