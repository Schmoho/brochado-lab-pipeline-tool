{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amphiphysins belong to the expanding BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) family proteins, all members of which share a highly conserved N-terminal BAR domain, which has predicted coiled-coil structures required for amphiphysin dimerisation and plasma membrane interaction [[cite:PUB00014927]]. Almost all members also share a conserved C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which mediates their interactions with the GTPase dynamin and the inositol-5'-phosphatase synaptojanin 1 in vertebrates and with actin in yeast. The central region of all these proteins is most variable. In mammals, the central region of amphiphysin I and amphiphysin IIa contains a proline-arginine-rich region for endophilin binding and a CLAP domain, for binding to clathrin and AP-2. The interactions mediated by both the central and C-terminal domains are believed to be modulated by protein phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00006137], [cite:PUB00006087]].</p>\n\n<p>Amphiphysins are proteins that are thought to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, actin function, and signalling pathways. In vertebrates, amphiphysins may regulate, but are not essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of SVs. However, in Drosophila amphiphysin is not involved at all in SV endocytosis but is required for T-tubule structure and excitation-contraction coupling muscles and plays a role in membrane morphogenesis in developing photoreceptors and a variety of other cells [[cite:PUB00014927]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes amphiphysin 2 (also known as Myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1) , which was the second amphiphysin family member found in mammals. The gene encoding it has been found to be alternatively spliced. The various products have been named: BIN-1, Sh3P9, BRAMP-2 and ALP-1. They have different distribution patterns, with the largest form (~95 kD) being expressed solely in the brain, where it shares a very similar (if not identical) distribution pattern to amphiphysin 1 [[cite:PUB00006137]]. This protein is a a key player in the control of plasma membrane curvature, membrane shaping and membrane remodeling. It is required in muscle cells for the formation of T-tubules, tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane that function in depolarization-contraction coupling [[cite:PUB00101547]]. It is also involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicles sorting, modulation of BACE1 trafficking and the control of amyloid-beta production [[cite:PUB00101548]]. It has been shown that in vitro, it has actin bundling activity and stabilizes actin filaments against depolymerization [[cite:PUB00101549]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036028", "name" "SH3-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027267", "name" "AH/BAR domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01253" "AMPHIPHYSIN2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amphiphysin 2", "short" "Amphiphysin_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 508, "taxa" 1601, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 15049, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2109, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1325}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003023", :literature {"PUB00014927" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Zhang B" "Zelhof AC."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0854.2002.30702.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Amphiphysins: raising the BAR for synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane dynamics.
