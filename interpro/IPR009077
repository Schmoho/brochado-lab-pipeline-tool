{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The 20S proteasome is a multicatalytic complex that is responsible for the non-lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins.  The proteasome is composed of a catalytic core that is regulated by protein complexes, which bind to the ends of the cylindrical core structure.  One of these regulatory complexes is the PA28 activator complex (also known as the 11S regulator, or REG), a ring-shaped hexameric structure that enhances the peptidase activity of the core enzyme.  Three REG subunits have been isolated, REGalpha, REGbeta and REGgamma.  REGalpha and REGbeta preferentially form a heteromeric complex with alternating alpha and beta subunits.  The structure of the human REGalpha subunit reveals a heptameric barrel-shaped assembly containing a central channel [[cite:PUB00013234]].  The binding of REG is thought to create a pore through with substrates and products can pass.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036252", "name" "Proteasome activator superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036996", "name" "Proteasome activator PA28, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036997", "name" "Proteasome activator PA28, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10660" "PROTEASOME REGULATOR PA28"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasome activator PA28", "short" "Proteasome_activ_PA28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1296, "taxa" 5079, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4483, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4483, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2952}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009077", :literature {"PUB00013234" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6660", "authors" ["Knowlton JR" "Johnston SC" "Whitby FG" "Realini C" "Zhang Z" "Rechsteiner M" "Hill CP."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/37670", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of the proteasome activator REGalpha (PA28alpha).", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "639-43", "volume" "390", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9403698}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008537", "name" "proteasome activator complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009077", "name" "Proteasome activator PA28", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
