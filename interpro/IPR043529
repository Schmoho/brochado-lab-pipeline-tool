{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the alpha-protein kinase 1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase that has no homology to conventional protein kinases and phosphorylate amino acids located within α-helices [[cite:PUB00094171]]. The N-terminal region had several conserved secondary α-helix structures with amphipathic properties [[cite:PUB00094170]]. The structure contains 18 helices (α1 to α18), forming seven antiparallel pairs. The one-by-one-packed seven helix pairs form a right-hand solenoid, similar to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain structure [[cite:PUB00094172]].</p>\n\n<p>This kinase detects bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern metabolites (PAMPs) and initiates an innate immune response, a critical step for pathogen elimination and engagement of adaptive immunity. Specifically recognises and binds ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose (ADP-Heptose), a potent PAMP present in all Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. ADP-Heptose binds to a narrow pocket of the concave side of the alpha-protein kinase 1 N-terminal which stimulates its kinase activity to phosphorylate and activate TIFA, triggering proinflammatory NF-kappa-B signalling [[cite:PUB00094172], [cite:PUB00094173]]. In addition, alpha-protein kinase 1 may play a role in regulating intracellular trafficking processes through the phosphorylation of myosin MYO1A [[cite:PUB00094171]]. It has been shown that this kinase is also involved in monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU)-induced inflammation and gout by phosphorylation of myosin motor protein which enable the vesicle transport of of certain cytokines (like TNF-alpha) to the plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00094170]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46747" "ALPHA-PROTEIN KINASE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-protein kinase 1", "short" "ALPK1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 495, "taxa" 1849, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 986, "sets" 0, "proteins" 986, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 621}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
