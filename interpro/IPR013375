{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aminoacylation of tRNA(Cys) with Cys, and cysteine biosynthesis in the process, happens in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and several other archaea by misacylation of tRNA(Cys) with O-phosphoserine (Sep), followed by modification of the phosphoserine to cysteine. In some species, direct tRNA-cys aminoacylation also occurs but this pathway is required for Cys biosynthesis. Members of this protein family catalyze the second step in this two step pathway, using pyridoxal phosphate and a sulphur donor to synthesize Cys from Sep while attached to the tRNA [[cite:PUB00020741]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01675" "O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02539" "O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase, archaea", "short" "Sep_Cys-tRNA_synth_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 630, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 696, "sets" 0, "proteins" 696, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 604}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0304", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0304"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
