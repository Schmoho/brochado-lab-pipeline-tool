{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents tRNA-dihydrouridine synthases from the nifR3 family that includes NifR3 itself, from Rhodobacter capsulatus and DusB from E. coli [[cite:PUB00106870]]. Members of this family catalyse the reduction of the 5,6-double bond of a uridine residue on tRNA. Dihydrouridine modification of tRNA is widely observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00014304]], and also in some archaea. Most dihydrouridines are found in the D loop of t-RNAs. The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently unknown, but may increase conformational flexibility of the tRNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1vhn", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative flavin oxidoreductase with flavin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR024036", "name" "tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase, putative, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00737" "tRNA dihydrouridine synthase DusB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase DusB-like", "short" "DusB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8091, "taxa" 30336, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33410, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33410, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25442}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
