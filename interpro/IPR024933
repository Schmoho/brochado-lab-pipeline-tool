{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Septin and tuftelin interacting proteins (STIPs) are G-patch domain proteins involved in spliceosome disassembly [[cite:PUB00088154]]. The mouse protein, known as TFT11 was originally identified as a protein interacting with tuftelin, one of the presumed enamel matrix proteins [[cite:PUB00056831]]. The Drosophila protein STP1 was originally identified as a septin-interacting protein [[cite:PUB00035473]]. In both cases these interactions were identified by a yeast two-hybrid system and their function and direct physical association were not characterised. Subsequent studies show that these proteins are widely expressed and function as splicing factors [[cite:PUB00056832], [cite:PUB00056834]]. STIP is essential for embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00056835]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017706" "Tuftelin-interacting protein 11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Septin and tuftelin interacting protein", "short" "TFP11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1064, "taxa" 4391, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1803, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1713, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1103}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024933", :literature {"PUB00056831" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-4", "authors" ["Paine CT" "Paine ML" "Snead ML."], "ISO_journal" "Connect.
