{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria directly translocate effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells via a type III secretion system. Type III effector proteins are determinants of virulence on susceptible plant hosts; they are also the proteins that trigger specific disease resistance in resistant plant hosts. Evolution of type III effectors is dominated by competing forces: the likely requirement for conservation of virulence function, the avoidance of host defenses, and possible adaptation to new hosts.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Members of this family of plant pathogenic proteins adopt an elongated structure somewhat reminiscent of a mushroom that can be divided into 'stalk' and 'head' subdomains. The stalk subdomain is composed of the N-terminal helix (alpha1) and β strands beta3-beta4. An antiparallel β sheet (beta5, beta7-beta8) forms the base of the head subdomain that interacts with the stalk. A pair of twisted antiparallel β sheets (beta1 and beta6; beta2 and beta9/9') supported by alpha2 form the dome of the head. The head subdomain possesses weak structural similarity with the catalytic portion of a number of ADP-ribosylt ransferase toxins [[cite:PUB00030874]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1s21", "name" "Crystal Structure of AvrPphF ORF2, A Type III Effector from P. syringae"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09143" "AvrPphF-ORF-2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III effector HopF2", "short" "T3_effector_HopF2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 144, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 145}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015226", :literature {"PUB00030874" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Singer AU" "Desveaux D" "Betts L" "Chang JH" "Nimchuk Z" "Grant SR" "Dangl JL" "Sondek J."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2004.06.023", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structures of the type III effector protein AvrPphF and its chaperone reveal residues required for plant pathogenesis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1669-81", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15341731}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015226", "name" "Type III effector HopF2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 6}}}
