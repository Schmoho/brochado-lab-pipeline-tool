{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CAAX box protein 1 (CAAX1, FAM127A) is found in primates. CAAX refers to the highly characteristic C-terminal residues, a cysteine and two aliphatic residues followed by any residue, a C-terminal tetrapeptide recognition motif called the Ca1a2X box [[cite:PUB00076037]]. This motif on substrates is recognised by prenyltransferases that then attach an isoprenoid lipid (a process termed prenylation), one of the many post-translational modifications that occur in cells [[cite:PUB00031513]]. The function of the prenylated protein is not known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15895" "CAAX box cerebral protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CAAX box protein 1", "short" "CAAX_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 98, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 53, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031771", :literature {"PUB00031513" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Reid TS" "Terry KL" "Casey PJ" "Beese LS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
