The enzyme is composed of large (rbcL) and small (rbcS) subunits, and has been found in algae, cryptophytes and land plants. This entry represents the small subunit, N-methyltransferase I, of Rubisco from cryptophytes. Cryptophytes posses a DNA-containing nucleomorph in addition to a nucleus, mitochondria and plastids; these dwarf nucleomorphs are remnants of red-algae symbionts [[cite:PUB00014426], [cite:PUB00014562]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046341", "name" "SET domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF026986" "Predicted rubisco-cytochrome methylase, MET type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rubisco-cytochrome methylase MET", "short" "Rubisco-cyt_methylase_MET"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 19, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
