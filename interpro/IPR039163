{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ER membrane protein complex subunit 7 (EMC7) is a component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC). This complex was first found to interact with the degradation of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) [[cite:PUB00070552]], thus suggesting a role in the biosynthesis of transmembrane proteins. More recently, it was shown that EMC acts as a conserved co- and post-translational insertase at the endoplasmic reticulum in an energy-independent manner [[cite:PUB00098229], [cite:PUB00096682]]. EMC7 has been misnamed C11orf3, but is more correctly named C15orf24 because the gene is actually on human chromosome 15.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13605" "ER MEMBRANE PROTEIN COMPLEX SUBUNIT 7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ER membrane protein complex subunit 7", "short" "EMC7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2343, "taxa" 9876, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4624, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4624, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2667}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039163", :literature {"PUB00098229" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Xiong L" "Zhang L" "Yang Y" "Li N" "Lai W" "Wang F" "Zhu X" "Wang T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Differ", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Death Differ", "title" "ER complex proteins are required for rhodopsin biosynthesis and photoreceptor survival in Drosophila and mice.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "646-661", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31263175}, "PUB00096682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6502", "authors" ["Pleiner T" "Tomaleri GP" "Januszyk K" "Inglis AJ" "Hazu M" "Voorhees RM."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structural basis for membrane insertion by the human ER membrane protein complex.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "433-436", "volume" "369", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32439656}, "PUB00070552" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Christianson JC" "Olzmann JA" "Shaler TA" "Sowa ME" "Bennett EJ" "Richter CM" "Tyler RE" "Greenblatt EJ" "Harper JW" "Kopito RR."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
