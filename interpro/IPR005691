This is accompished by two protein complexes, the Toc complex located at the outer membrane and the Tic complex loacted at the inner membrane [[cite:PUB00034696]]. The Toc complex recognises specific proteins by a cleavable N-terminal sequence and is primarily responsible for translocation through the outer membrane, while the Tic complex translocates the protein through the inner membrane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents Tic20, a core member of the Tic complex.
