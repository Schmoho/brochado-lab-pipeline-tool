{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the gamma-secretase-activating protein (GSAP) family, whose members include the mammalian GSAPs and the insect pigeon proteins (also known as linotte proteins). GSAP is a gamma-secretase regulator. It specifically activates the production of beta-amyloid protein through interactions with both gamma-secretase and its substrate, the amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) [[cite:PUB00060159]]. This has led to interest in the protein as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [[cite:PUB00060159]]. Pigeon/linotte was initially identified as a gene that functions in adult Drosophila during associative learning [[cite:PUB00060161]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13630" "GAMMA-SECRETASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gamma-secretase-activating protein family", "short" "GSAP_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 719, "taxa" 3071, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1647, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1647, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1012}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026172", :literature {"PUB00060159" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7311", "authors" ["He G" "Luo W" "Li P" "Remmers C" "Netzer WJ" "Hendrick J" "Bettayeb K" "Flajolet M" "Gorelick F" "Wennogle LP" "Greengard P."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09325", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Gamma-secretase activating protein is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "95-8", "volume" "467", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20811458}, "PUB00060161" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bolwig GM" "Del Vecchio M" "Hannon G" "Tully T."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0896-6273(95)90174-4", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Molecular cloning of linotte in Drosophila: a novel gene that functions in adults during associative learning.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "829-42", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7576632}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026172", "name" "Gamma-secretase-activating protein family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
