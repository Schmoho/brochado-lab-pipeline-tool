{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Thiolases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyse the reversible thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA into acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, a 2-step reaction involving a covalent intermediate formed with a catalytic cysteine. They are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Two different types of thiolase [[cite:PUB00001113], [cite:PUB00002552], [cite:PUB00003423]] are found both in eukaryotes and in prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase ([ec:2.3.1.9]) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase ([ec:2.3.1.16]). 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I) has a broad chain-length specificity for its substrates and is involved in degradative pathways such as fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase II) is specific for the thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and involved in biosynthetic pathways such as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis or steroid biogenesis.</p>\n\n<p>In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one located in the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.</p>\n\n<p>There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The first located in the N-terminal section of the enzymes is involved in the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal extremity is the active site base involved in deprotonation in the condensation reaction [[cite:PUB00052320]].</p>\n\n<p>Mammalian nonspecific lipid-transfer protein (nsL-TP) (also known as sterol carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems to exist in two different forms: a 14 Kd protein (SCP-2) and a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport; the latter is found in peroxisomes. The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical to SCP-2 while the N-terminal portion is evolutionary related to thiolases [[cite:PUB00001113]].</p>\n\n<p>The beta-ketothiolases from Haloferax mediterranei BktB and phaA have different substrate specificities and are involved in PHBV biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00070339]]. Their catalytic residues have been identified [[cite:PUB00070339]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vu1", "name" "Biosynthetic thiolase from Z. ramigera.
