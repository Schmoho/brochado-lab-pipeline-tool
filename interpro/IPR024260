{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Vac7 is localised at the vacuole membrane, a location which is consistent with its involvement in vacuole morphology and inheritance [[cite:PUB00055974]]. Vac7 has been shown to function as an upstream regulator of the Fab1 lipid kinase pathway [[cite:PUB00055975]]. The Fab1 lipid pathway is important for correct regulation of membrane trafficking events. It has been identified as a LEA-2 homologue together with TMEM106B from humans and Tag1 in yeast, all predicted to be lipid transfer proteins [[cite:PUB00100166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12751" "Vacuolar segregation subunit 7"}, "panther" {"PTHR28258" "VACUOLAR SEGREGATION PROTEIN 7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar segregation subunit 7", "short" "Vac7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 853, "taxa" 2268, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1416, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1343, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 839}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024260", :literature {"PUB00055974" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Bonangelino CJ" "Catlett NL" "Weisman LS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
