{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>FIP-Fve (Fungal Immunomodulatory Protein Fve) is a major fruiting body protein from Flammulina velutipes, a mushroom possessing immunomodulatory activity [[cite:PUB00066809]]. It stimulates lymphocyte mitogenesis, suppresses systemic anaphylaxis reactions and oedema, enhances transcription of IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and haemagglutinates red blood cells. It appears to be a lectin with specificity for complex cell-surface carbohydrates. Fve adopts a tertiary structure consisting of an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich, with seven strands arranged in two β sheets, in a Greek-key topology. It forms a non-covalently linked homodimer containing no Cys, His or Met residues; dimerisation occurs by 3-D domain swapping of the N-terminal helices and is stabilised predominantly by hydrophobic interactions [[cite:PUB00029592]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1osy", "name" "Crystal structure of FIP-Fve fungal immunomodulatory protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053742", "name" "Fungal Immunomodulatory Lectin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036344", "name" "Fungal immunomodulatory protein FIP-Fve superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09259" "Fungal immunomodulatory protein Fve"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunomodulatory protein FIP-Fve, fungal", "short" "Immunomodulatory_FIP-Fve_fun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 34, "taxa" 158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 89, "sets" 0, "proteins" 85, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015339", :literature {"PUB00066809" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ko JL" "Hsu CI" "Lin RH" "Kao CL" "Lin JY."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
