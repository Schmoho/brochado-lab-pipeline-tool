{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents N-acetylneuraminate epimerase from Escherichia coli (NanM, also known as YjhT) and similar proteobacterial proteins. NanM converts alpha-N-acetylneuranimic acid (Neu5Ac) to the beta-anomer, accelerating the equilibrium between the alpha- and beta-anomers. This enzyme probably facilitates sialidase-negative bacteria to compete sucessfully for limited amounts of extracellular Neu5Ac, which is likely taken up in the beta-anomer. In addition, the rapid removal of sialic acid from solution might be advantageous to the bacterium to damp down host responses. Besides, it forms linear aceneuramate during interconversion of Neu5Ac anomers [[cite:PUB00045883], [cite:PUB00099659]]. Some species carry what appears to be a cyclically permuted homologue of this protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2uvk", "name" "Structure of YjhT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015915", "name" "Kelch-type beta propeller", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03547" "YjhT family mutarotase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01195" "N-acetylneuraminate epimerase [nanM]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylneuraminate epimerase, proteobacteria", "short" "NanM_proteobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 70, "taxa" 711, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1285, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1285, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1097}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
