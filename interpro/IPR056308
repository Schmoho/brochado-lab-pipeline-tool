{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Anti-Pycsar protein Apyc1 from Bacillus phage SBSphiJ and similar sequences from tailed bacteriophages and bacterial prophages. Apyc1 counteracts the endogenous Pycsar antiviral defence system [[cite:PUB00101341]]. Members of this group are phosphodiesterases that enable metal-dependent hydrolysis of host cyclic nucleotide Pycsar defence signals such as cCMP and cUMP [[cite:PUB00101341]]. These proteins have a metallo beta-lactamase (MBL)-like fold with homology to RNase and phosphodiesterase enzymes [[cite:PUB00101341]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7u2s", "name" "Structure of Paenibacillus xerothermodurans Apyc1 in the apo state"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23023" "Anti-Pycsar protein Apyc1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-Pycsar protein Apyc1", "short" "Anti-Pycsar_Apyc1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 282, "taxa" 1257, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 954, "sets" 0, "proteins" 954, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 677}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056308", :literature {"PUB00101341" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7910", "authors" ["Hobbs SJ" "Wein T" "Lu A" "Morehouse BR" "Schnabel J" "Leavitt A" "Yirmiya E" "Sorek R" "Kranzusch PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Phage anti-CBASS and anti-Pycsar nucleases subvert bacterial immunity.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "522-526", "volume" "605", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35395152}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056308", "name" "Anti-Pycsar protein Apyc1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 308}}}
