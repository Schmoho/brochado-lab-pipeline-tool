{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The major pathways of mRNA turnover in eukaryotes initiate with shortening of the poly(A) tail. CAF1 (also known as CCR4-associated factor 1) is an RNase of the DEDD superfamily, and a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex that mediates 3' to 5' mRNA deadenylation [[cite:PUB00082305], [cite:PUB00082306]].  In yeast, CAF1 ([swissprot:P39008]) is also known as POP2, and encodes a critical component of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase [[cite:PUB00082302], [cite:PUB00019239]]. It is required for normal mRNA deadenylation<i>in vivo</i>and localises to the cytoplasm. CAF1 copurifies with a CCR4-dependent poly(A)-specific exonuclease activity. The crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae POP2 has been resolved [[cite:PUB00019241]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some members of this family contain a single-stranded nucleic acid binding domain, R3H, such as poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN), which also contains an RRM domain [[cite:PUB00082307]]. PARN is only conserved in vertebrates and may be important in regulated deadenylation such as early developmentand DNA damage response [[cite:PUB00082309], [cite:PUB00082310]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2p51", "name" "Crystal structure of the S. pombe Pop2p deadenylation subunit"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012337", "name" "Ribonuclease H-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036397", "name" "Ribonuclease H superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04857" "CAF1 family ribonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease CAF1", "short" "RNase_CAF1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 208, "proteomes" 2678, "taxa" 9294, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23552, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16599, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10673}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
