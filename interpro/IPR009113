{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the outer capsid protein Mu1 and VP4.</p>\r\n<p>Mu1 is an outer capsid protein that acts as a reoviral penetration agent. Non-enveloped animal reoviruses must enter host cells by membrane penetration that does not involve membrane fusion, as they lack a viral membrane. Reoviruses are activated by proteolytic cleavage in the intestinal lumen, leading to infectious subviral particles. The core of the virus is coated by a layer of mu1 and sigma3 proteins. Proteases strip off sigma3 exposing mu1, which provides the membrane penetration machinery that perforates the membrane. In addition, N-terminal myristoylation of polypeptide Mu1 are required for site-specific cleavage to Mu1C in transfected cells [[cite:PUB00036074]]. Mu1 forms a trimer, where the three mu1 molecules are coiled around one another with a right-handed twist. The mu1 chain folds into four distinct domains: three intertwined, predominantly α helical domains and a jelly-roll β-sandwich [[cite:PUB00013280]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036256", "name" "Mu1/VP4 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015960", "name" "Mu1 membrane penetration protein, domain IV", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015962", "name" "Mu1 membrane penetration protein, domain II", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015961", "name" "Mu1 membrane penetration protein, domain I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR044937", "name" "Mu1 membrane penetration protein, domain III", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05993" "Reovirus major virion structural protein Mu-1/Mu-1C (M2)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Outer capsid protein Mu1/VP4", "short" "Mu1/VP4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 84, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 345, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009113", :literature {"PUB00013280" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Liemann S" "Chandran K" "Baker TS" "Nibert ML" "Harrison SC."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00612-8", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure of the reovirus membrane-penetration protein, Mu1, in a complex with is protector protein, Sigma3.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "283-95", "volume" "108", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11832217}, "PUB00036074" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Tillotson L" "Shatkin AJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
