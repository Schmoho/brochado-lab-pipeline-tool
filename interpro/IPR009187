{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This superfamily consists of prokaryotic Ku domain containing proteins. In the eukaryotes it has been shown that the Ku protein is involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining [[cite:PUB00013573], [cite:PUB00013574]]. The Ku protein is a heterodimer of approximately 70kDa and 80kDa subunits [[cite:PUB00007947]]. Both these subunits have strong sequence similarity and it has been suggested that they may have evolved by gene duplication from a homodimeric ancestor in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00013573]]. The prokaryotic Ku members are homodimers and they have been predicted to be involved in the DNA repair system, which is mechanistically similar to eukaryotic non-homologous end joining [[cite:PUB00007946], [cite:PUB00013575]]. Recent findings have implicated yeast Ku in telomeric structure maintenance in addition to on-homologous end-joining. Some of the phenotypes of the Ku-knockout mice may indicate a similar role for Ku at mammalian telomeres [[cite:PUB00013576]].</p>\n\n<p>Ιt is difficult to determine the correct evolutionary trajectory of the Ku domain. It is possible that the core Ku domain was present in bacteria and archaea even before the presence of the eukaryotes. Eukaryotes might have vertically inherited the Ku-core protein, from a common ancestor shared with a certain archaeal lineage or through horizontal transfer from bacteria. Alternatively, the core Ku domain could have evolved in the eukaryotic lineage and then horizontally transferred to the prokaryotes. Sequencing of additional archaeal genomes and those of early-branching eukaryotes may help resolving the evolutionary history of the Ku domain.</p>\n\n<p>The eukaryotic Ku heterodimer comprises an α/β N-terminal, a central β-barrel domain and a helical C-terminal arm [[cite:PUB00007947]]. Structural analysis of the Ku70/80 heterodimer bound to DNA indicate that subunit contacts lead to the formation of a highly charged channel through which the DNA passes without making any contacts with the DNA bases [[cite:PUB00007947]].</p>\n\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00013577]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016194", "name" "SPOC-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00789" "KU_like"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006493" "Predicted Ku DNA-binding protein, prokaryotic type"}, "panther" {"PTHR41251" "NON-HOMOLOGOUS END JOINING PROTEIN KU"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02772" "Ku protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_01875" "Non-homologous end joining protein Ku [ku]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Non-homologous end joining protein Ku, prokaryotic type", "short" "Prok_Ku"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3763, "taxa" 13027, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18572, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18430, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14474}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0492", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0492"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009187", :literature {"PUB00013577" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Yoo S" "Dynan WS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi972100w", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Characterization of the RNA binding properties of Ku protein.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "1336-43", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9477961}, "PUB00007947" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6847", "authors" ["Walker JR" "Corpina RA" "Goldberg J."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35088000", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of the Ku heterodimer bound to DNA and its implications for double-strand break repair.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "607-14", "volume" "412", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11493912}, "PUB00007946" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Aravind L" "Koonin EV."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.181001", "medline_journal" "Genome Res", "title" "Prokaryotic homologs of the eukaryotic DNA-end-binding protein Ku, novel domains in the Ku protein and prediction of a prokaryotic double-strand break repair system.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1365-74", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11483577}, "PUB00013573" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hopfner KP" "Putnam CD" "Tainer JA."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
