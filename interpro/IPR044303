{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant zinc finger proteins, including ZAT1/4/9 from Arabidopsis. They may regulate the maturation of the outermost cells of the root cap in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00095786]]. Overexpression of ZAT1 has been shown to induce the ectopic expression of PUTATIVE ASPARTIC PROTEASE3 involved in the programmed cell death. ZAT1 possesses two conserved EAR motifs, the second EAR motif is essential for the growth inhibition by ZAT1 [[cite:PUB00095786]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46326" "ZINC FINGER PROTEIN ZAT1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger protein ZAT1/4/9", "short" "ZAT1/4/9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 236, "taxa" 965, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1703, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1703, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1053}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044303", :literature {"PUB00095786" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Song SK" "Jang HU" "Kim YH" "Lee BH" "Lee MM."], "ISO_journal" "BMB Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMB Rep", "title" "Overexpression of three related root-cap outermost-cell-specific C2H2-type zinc-finger protein genes suppresses the growth of Arabidopsis in an EAR-motif-dependent manner.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "160-165", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32172729}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044303", "name" "Zinc finger protein ZAT1/4/9", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
