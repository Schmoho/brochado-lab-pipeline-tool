{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Examples of lateral asymmetry are often found in vertebrates (e.g., the heart being on the left side), but the molecular mechanisms governing establishment of left-right (L-R) handedness are unknown [[cite:PUB00007631]]. It is now thought that the gene lefty, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta family, may encode a morphogen for L-R determination. Lefty protein, which contains the cysteine-knot motif characteristic of this superfamily, is expressed in the left half of gastrulating mouse embryos. This asymmetric expression is transient and occurs just before the first sign of lateral asymmetry appears]. Thus lefty may be involved in establishing L-R asymmetry in the organ systems of mammals.</p>\n\n<p>Abnormal endometrial bleeding is a common manifestation of gynaecological diseases. A human gene, termed endometrial bleeding associated factor (ebaf), which is expressed strongly in endometrium, has been shown to be associated with abnormal endometrial bleeding [[cite:PUB00007630]]. The predicted protein product of ebaf shares similarity with members of TGF-beta superfamily. Thus ebaf is a novel member of the TGF-beta superfamily and an endometrial tissue factor whose expression is associated with normal menstrual and abnormal endometrial bleeding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037402" "Lefty protein"}, "prints" {"PR01427" "TGFBETA4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Left- Right determination factor", "short" "LRDF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 629, "taxa" 2151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1756, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1050, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 737}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003942", :literature {"PUB00007630" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kothapalli R" "Buyuksal I" "Wu SQ" "Chegini N" "Tabibzadeh S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
