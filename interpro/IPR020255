{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Curli are extracellular functional amyloids that are assembled by enteric bacteria during biofilm formation and host colonization. The csg (curli specific gene) operon encodes major structural and accessory proteins that are required for curli production. The csgBAC operon encodes the major and minor curli fibre components, CsgA and CsgB, respectively. CsgA is secreted to the extracellular milieu as an unfolded protein and forms amyloid polymers upon interacting with the CsgB nucleator [[cite:PUB00091004]]. CsgA is comprised of five imperfect repeating units with highly conserved glutamine and asparagine residues that are important for amyloid formation. Each repeating unit is predicted to form a strand-loop-strand motif [[cite:PUB00091005]]. In vitro, CsgC inhibits CsgA amyloid formation at substoichiometric concentrations and maintains CsgA in a non-Î²-sheet rich conformation, making CsgC an efficient and selective amyloid inhibitor [[cite:PUB00091004]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17334" "Minor curli fiber component A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Minor curli fiber component A", "short" "CsgA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 345, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 300, "sets" 0, "proteins" 300, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 217}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020255", :literature {"PUB00091004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Evans ML" "Chorell E" "Taylor JD" "Aden J" "Gotheson A" "Li F" "Koch M" "Sefer L" "Matthews SJ" "Wittung-Stafshede P" "Almqvist F" "Chapman MR."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
