{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SgrT is a small regulatory polypeptide that inhibits glucose transport activity by a yet unknown mechanism. It is part of a posttranscriptional regulation system in E. coli which consists of a small regulatory RNA (SgrS) and SgrT. During accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate or fructose-6-phosphate, SgrS is involved in downregulation of ptsG mRNA stability, whereas SgrT inhibits glucose transport [[cite:PUB00076033]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15894" "Inhibitor of glucose uptake transporter SgrT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inhibitor of glucose uptake transporter SgrT", "short" "SgrT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 42, "taxa" 729, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 741, "sets" 0, "proteins" 741, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 559}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031767", :literature {"PUB00076033" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kosfeld A" "Jahreis K."], "ISO_journal" "Metabolites", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo2040756", "medline_journal" "Metabolites", "title" "Characterization of the Interaction Between the Small Regulatory Peptide SgrT and the EIICBGlc of the Glucose-Phosphotransferase System of E. coli K-12.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "756-74", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24957761}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046325", "name" "negative regulation of D-glucose import", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031767", "name" "Inhibitor of glucose uptake transporter SgrT", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 41}}}
