{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins specific to actinomycetes, including RsbA of Streptomyces coelicolor ([swissprot:Q9R422]). RsbA was suggested as an anti-sigma factor by genomic location preceding sigB, by homology to RsbW of Bacillus subtilis, and by binding to SigmaB and effects on its activity [[cite:PUB00106150]]. Members of this family have MEDS sensory domain in the N-terminal region and a histidine kinase-like ATPase domain in the C-terminal region. The proteins included in this group may perform different regulatory functions in different lineages such as PrsR from Streptomyces avermitilis ([swissprot:Q826M4]), an important regulator of both avermectin production and stress responses [[cite:PUB00106151]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041045" "anti-sigma factor RsbA family regulatory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-sigma factor RsbA-like", "short" "RsbA-like_anti_sig"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 594, "taxa" 1708, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2507, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2507, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1909}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047718", :literature {"PUB00106150" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Lee EJ" "Cho YH" "Kim HS" "Ahn BE" "Roe JH."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Regulation of sigmaB by an anti- and an anti-anti-sigma factor in Streptomyces coelicolor in response to osmotic stress.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "8490-8", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15576799}, "PUB00106151" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sun D" "Wang Q" "Chen Z" "Li J" "Wen Y."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "An Alternative σ Factor, σ<sup>8</sup>, Controls Avermectin Production and Multiple Stress Responses in <i>Streptomyces avermitilis</i>.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "736", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28484446}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047718", "name" "Anti-sigma factor RsbA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
