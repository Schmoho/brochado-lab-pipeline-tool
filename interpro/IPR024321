{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of peptidase inhibitors is expressed in plasmodial protozoal species. Falstatin is found to be a potent reversible inhibitor of the P. falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, as well as other parasite- and non-parasite-derived cysteine proteases, but is only a relatively weak inhibitor of the P. falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain-1 and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1. Thus, P. falciparum requires expression of falstatin to limit proteolysis by certain host or parasite cysteine proteases during erythrocyte invasion [[cite:PUB00055997], [cite:PUB00152831]]. In addition, in the mosquito vector, it is essential for the gliding motility of hemocoel sporozoites and, therefore, for salivary gland invasion and the subsequent transmission from the mosquito to the mammalian host [[cite:PUB00152832]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036331", "name" "Chagasin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12628" "Falstatin, cysteine peptidase inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protease inhibitor, falstatin", "short" "Prot_Inh_falstatin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 78, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 71, "sets" 0, "proteins" 69, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024321", :literature {"PUB00152831" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rennenberg A" "Lehmann C" "Heitmann A" "Witt T" "Hansen G" "Nagarajan K" "Deschermeier C" "Turk V" "Hilgenfeld R" "Heussler VT."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000825", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Exoerythrocytic Plasmodium parasites secrete a cysteine protease inhibitor involved in sporozoite invasion and capable of blocking cell death of host hepatocytes.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "e1000825", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20361051}, "PUB00152832" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Boysen KE" "Matuschewski K."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00874-13", "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Inhibitor of cysteine proteases is critical for motility and infectivity of Plasmodium sporozoites.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e00874-13", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24281719}, "PUB00055997" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Pandey KC" "Singh N" "Arastu-Kapur S" "Bogyo M" "Rosenthal PJ."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020117", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Falstatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum, facilitates erythrocyte invasion.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "e117", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17083274}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024321", "name" "Protease inhibitor, falstatin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 23}}}
