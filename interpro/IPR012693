Phosphonates are a class of phosphorus-containing organic compound with a stable direct C-P bond rather than a C-O-P linkage. Phosphonates are widespread among naturally occurring compounds in all kingdoms of wildlife, but only prokaryotic microorganisms are able to cleave this bond. Certain bacteria such as E. coli can use alkylphosphonates as a phosphorus source. A number of bacterial species have operons, typically about 14 genes in size, with genes for ATP-dependent transport of phosphonates, degradation, and regulation of the expression of the system [[cite:PUB00080858], [cite:PUB00033214], [cite:PUB00080859], [cite:PUB00043019], [cite:PUB00080860]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes transporters of phosphite (an organophosphorous compound with the formula P(OR)<sub>3</sub>) and hypophosphite (H<sub>2</sub>PO<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub>), including the phosphite import ATP-binding protein PxtA and hypophosphite import ATP-binding protein HtxD, both from Pseudomonas stutzeri [[cite:PUB00070841]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03256" "ATP-binding cassette domain of the binding protein-dependent phosphonate transport system"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02315" "phosphonate ABC transporter ATP-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, phosphonate import, PhnC", "short" "ABC_transpr_PhnC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2450, "taxa" 10754, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11881, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11881, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9174}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC51237", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC51237"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"} {"accession" "GenProp0236", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0236"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
