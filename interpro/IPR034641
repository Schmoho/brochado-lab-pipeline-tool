{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The rhamnogalacturonan lyase of the polysaccharide lyase family 11 (RGL11) cleaves glycoside bonds in polygalacturonan as well as RG (rhamnogalacturonan) type-I through a beta-elimination reaction. Functionally characterized members of this family, YesW and YesX from Bacillus subtilis, cleave glycoside bonds between rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues in the RG-I region of plant cell wall pectin. YesW and YesX work synergistically, with YesW cleaving the glycoside bond of the RG chain endolytically, and YesX converting the resultant oligosaccharides through an exotype reaction [[cite:PUB00083821], [cite:PUB00050452]]. There are two types of RG lyases, which both cleave the alpha-1,4 bonds of the RG-I main chain through a beta-elimination reaction, but belong to two structurally unrelated polysaccharide lyase (PL) families, 4 and 11.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zux", "name" "Crystal structure of rhamnogalacturonan lyase YesW complexed with rhamnose"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10318" "Rhamnogalacturonan lyase of the polysaccharide lyase family 11"}, "panther" {"PTHR43118" "RHAMNOGALACTURONAN LYASE (EUROFUNG)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polysaccharide lyase family 11", "short" "RGL11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1008, "taxa" 3826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5299, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5299, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3636}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
