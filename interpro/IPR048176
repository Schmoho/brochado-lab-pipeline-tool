{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents TrbC homologs found in Gammaproteobacteria. TrbC is a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of conjugation, which is the horizontal transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells. As a component of the Type IV secretion system (T4SS), TrbC is involved in the assembly and function of the conjugative pilus. The conjugative pilus acts as a bridge between the donor and recipient cells, facilitating the transfer of plasmids or other mobile genetic elements. TrbC is responsible for the formation and elongation of the pilus structure, allowing for efficient contact and DNA transfer between the bacterial cells [[cite:PUB00151437], [cite:PUB00151438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041447" "F-type conjugative transfer protein TrbC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TrbC, F-type conjugative transfer protein", "short" "TrbC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 312, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 574, "sets" 0, "proteins" 574, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 490}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048176", :literature {"PUB00151437" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Maneewannakul S" "Maneewannakul K" "Ippen-Ihler K."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.173.12.3872-3878.1991", "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Characterization of trbC, a new F plasmid tra operon gene that is essential to conjugative transfer.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "3872-8", "volume" "173", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2050638}, "PUB00151438" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Shala-Lawrence A" "Bragagnolo N" "Nowroozi-Dayeni R" "Kheyson S" "Audette GF."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.166", "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "The interaction of TraW and TrbC is required to facilitate conjugation in F-like plasmids.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "2386-2392", "volume" "503", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29966652}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048176", "name" "TrbC, F-type conjugative transfer protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
