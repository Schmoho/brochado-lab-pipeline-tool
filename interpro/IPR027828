{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a large family of uncharacterised proteins mostly from human gut bacteroides, but also some environmental and water bacteria (Planctomycetes), as well as metagenomic samples. Most proteins from this family are secreted or located on the outer surface, and may participate in cell-cell interactions or cell-nutrient interactions. This function is supported by a solved structure of a Bacteroides ovatus homologue, which adopts a galactose binding (jelly-roll) Î² barrel structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9fct", "name" "BtuJ1 - Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron B12 scavenging protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14717" "Domain of unknown function (DUF4465)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF4465", "short" "DUF4465"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 211, "taxa" 1140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1508, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1411, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 946}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027828", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027828", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF4465", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 30, "alignment:full" 307}}}
