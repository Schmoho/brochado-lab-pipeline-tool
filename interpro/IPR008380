{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a 5'-nucleotidase, [ec:3.1.3.5], specific for purines (IMP and GMP) [[cite:PUB00015569]].  These enzymes are members of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily.  HAD members are recognised by three short motifs {hhhhDxDx(T/V)}, {hhhh(T/S)}, and either {hhhh(D/E)(D/E)x(3-4)(G/N)} or {hhhh(G/N)(D/E)x(3-4)(D/E)} (where \"h\" stands for a hydrophobic residue).  Crystal structures of many HAD enzymes has verified PSI-PRED predictions of secondary structural elements which show each of the \"hhhh\" sequences of the motifs as part of β sheets.  This subfamily of enzymes is part of \"Subfamily I\" of the HAD superfamily by virtue of a \"cap\" domain in between motifs 1 and 2.  This subfamily's cap domain has a different predicted secondary structure than all other known HAD enzymes and thus has been designated \"subfamily IG\", the domain appears to consist of a mixed α/β fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5opp", "name" "Crystal structure of S408R cN-II mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02244" "HAD-IG family 5'-nucleotidase"}, "panther" {"PTHR12103" "5'-NUCLEOTIDASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING"}, "pfam" {"PF05761" "5' nucleotidase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD-superfamily hydrolase, subfamily IG, 5'-nucleotidase", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IG_5-nucl"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 136, "proteomes" 1583, "taxa" 6599, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13626, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8525}, "pathways" 62}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1753", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1753"} {"accession" "GenProp1469", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1469"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
