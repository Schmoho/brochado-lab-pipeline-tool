{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LRP chaperone MESD (also known as mesoderm development candidate 2) represents a set of highly conserved proteins found from nematodes to humans. \r\nIt is a chaperone that specifically assists with the folding of Î²-propeller/EGF modules within the family of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). It also acts as a modulator of the Wnt pathway, since some LDLRs are coreceptors for the canonical Wnt pathway and is essential for specification of embryonic polarity and mesoderm induction [[cite:PUB00053584]]. The Drosophila homologue, known as boca, is an endoplasmic reticulum protein required for wingless signaling and trafficking of LDL receptor family members [[cite:PUB00044357]].</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The final C-terminal residues, KEDL, are the endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence as it is an ER protein specifically required for the intracellular trafficking of members of the low-density lipoprotein family of receptors (LDLRs) [[cite:PUB00044357]]. The N- and C-terminal sequences are predicted to adopt a random coil conformation, with the exception of an isolated predicted helix within the N-terminal region, The central folded domain flanked by natively unstructured regions is the necessary structure for facilitating maturation of LRP6 (Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 6 Maturation) [[cite:PUB00044358]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ofg", "name" "Structured Domain of Caenorhabditis elegans BMY-1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10185" "Chaperone for wingless signalling and trafficking of LDL receptor"}, "panther" {"PTHR17600" "MESODERM DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATE 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LRP chaperone MESD", "short" "MESD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 32, "proteomes" 1063, "taxa" 4269, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1792, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1766, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1213}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019330", :literature {"PUB00044357" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Culi J" "Mann RS."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01279-5", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Boca, an endoplasmic reticulum protein required for wingless signaling and trafficking of LDL receptor family members in Drosophila.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "343-54", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12581524}, "PUB00044358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Koduri V" "Blacklow SC."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi700049g", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Requirement for natively unstructured regions of mesoderm development candidate 2 in promoting low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 maturation.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "6570-7", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17488095}, "PUB00053584" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hsieh JC" "Lee L" "Zhang L" "Wefer S" "Brown K" "DeRossi C" "Wines ME" "Rosenquist T" "Holdener BC."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00045-X", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Mesd encodes an LRP5/6 chaperone essential for specification of mouse embryonic polarity.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "355-67", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12581525}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006457", "name" "protein folding", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019330", "name" "LRP chaperone MESD", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 1206}}}
