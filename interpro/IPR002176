{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Escherichia coli RuvC gene is involved in DNA repair and in the late step of RecE and RecF pathway recombination [[cite:PUB00001215]]. RuvC protein ([ec:3.1.22.4]) cleaves cruciform junctions, which are formed by the extrusion of inverted repeat sequences from a super-coiled plasmid and which are structurally analogous to Holliday junctions, by introducing nicks into strands with the same polarity. The nicks leave a 5'terminal phosphate and a 3'terminal hydroxyl group which are ligated by E. coli or Bacteriophage T4 DNA ligases. Analysis of the cleavage sites suggests that DNA topology rather than a particular sequence determines the cleavage site. RuvC protein also cleaves Holliday junctions that are formed between gapped circular and linear duplex DNA by the function of RecA protein. The active form of RuvC protein is a dimer. This is mechanistically suited for an endonuclease involved in swapping DNA strands at the crossover junctions. It is inferred that RuvC protein is an endonuclease that resolves Holliday structures<i>in vivo</i> [[cite:PUB00001215]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ep4", "name" "Thermus thermophilus RuvC structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012337", "name" "Ribonuclease H-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036397", "name" "Ribonuclease H superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16962" "Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC"}, "panther" {"PTHR30194" "CROSSOVER JUNCTION ENDODEOXYRIBONUCLEASE RUVC"}, "hamap" {"MF_00034" "Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC [ruvC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00228" "crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC"}, "prints" {"PR00696" "RSOLVASERUVC"}, "pfam" {"PF02075" "Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC", "short" "X-over_junc_endoDNase_RuvC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 44, "proteomes" 8043, "taxa" 33357, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39332, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38940, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29307}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC01025", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC01025"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0198", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0198"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
