{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase (ICDH kinase/phosphatase) proteins. The enzyme has no activating compound but is specific for its substrate. It is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyses the reversible phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, [ec:1.1.1.42]) on a seryl residue. It consequently belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family [[cite:PUB00043362]], and it acts in the Krebs cycle [[cite:PUB00043363]]. The catalytic activities of ICDH kinase/phosphatase constitute a moiety conserved cycle, require ATP, and exhibit 'zero-order ultrasensitivity' [[cite:PUB00043364]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39559" "PTHR39559"}, "hamap" {"MF_00747" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase [aceK]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000719" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase AceK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinasephosphatase", "short" "Isocitrate_DH_AceK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 928, "taxa" 5104, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6366, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6365, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4677}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
