{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are response regulators containing CheY-like receiver and HTH (helix-turn-helix) DNA-binding domains. Several members of this group have been characterised as response regulators controlling the genes involved in metabolism of citrate or C4-dicarboxylates (aspartate, fumarate, malate, and succinate). In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the phosphorylation of CitB, subsequent conformational changes and increase of apparent DNA-binding affinity (10 to 100-fold), and specific binding to the two sites in the citC-citS intergenic region have been shown experimentally [[cite:PUB00011101]]. The DcuS/R system in Escherichia coli is involved in C4-dicarboxylate-stimulated regulation of the genes encoding the anaerobic fumarate respiratory system [[cite:PUB00011102]]. The DpiB/A system (synonyms: CriR, CitB, but note that the name CitB can also be used for unrelated proteins) is involved in transcriptional regulation of the cit operon (citrate-specific fermentation genes) and of genes involved in plasmid inheritance [[cite:PUB00011103]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Response regulators of the microbial two-component signal transduction systems typically consist of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver domain and a C-terminal output (usually DNA-binding) domain [[cite:PUB00011096], [cite:PUB00007866]]. In response to an environmental stimulus, a phosphoryl group is transferred from the His residue of sensor histidine kinase to an Asp residue in the CheY-like receiver domain of the cognate response regulator. Phosphorylation of the CheY-like receiver domain induces conformational changes that activate an associated output domain. Phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in the response regulator molecule have been demonstrated in direct structural studies [[cite:PUB00011097]]. In members of this group, these conformational changes affect the binding of the associated HTH domains to their recognition sites on the chromosomal DNA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HTH domains are very diverse with respect to their sequence, as well as the specific binding sites that they recognise [[cite:PUB00011096], [cite:PUB00011104], [cite:PUB00011105]]. There have been several attempts to classify them [[cite:PUB00011104], [cite:PUB00011105]]. A detailed sequence analysis of response regulator proteins has been hampered by the remarkable sequence conservation of their N-terminal CheY-like receiver domain, which largely masked (dis)similarities of the DNA-binding domains of various response regulators.</p>\r\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00011100], [cite:PUB00011106]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006171" "Response regulator of citrate/malate metabolism"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Signal transduction response regulator, citrate/malate metabolism", "short" "Sig_transdc_resp-reg_cit/mal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2108, "taxa" 7861, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13672, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13642, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10342}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024187", :literature {"PUB00011097" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lewis RJ" "Scott DJ" "Brannigan JA" "Ladds JC" "Cervin MA" "Spiegelman GB" "Hoggett JG" "Barak I" "Wilkinson AJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
