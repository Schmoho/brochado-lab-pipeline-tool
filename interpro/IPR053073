{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin-27 subunit beta is involved in the formation of IL-27, a heterodimeric cytokine playing a role in innate immunity. IL-27 has both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, influencing T-helper cell development, suppressing T-cell proliferation, and stimulating cytotoxic T-cell activity. It is pivotal for the differentiation of CD4 T-helper cells into TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells, promoting the rapid expansion of naive CD4 T-cells. IL-27 works synergistically with IL-12 in naive CD4 T-cells to induce interferon-gamma production and binds to the WSX-1/TCCR cytokine receptor. Additionally, it exhibits antitumor and antiangiogenic activities by activating the production of antiangiogenic chemokines [[cite:PUB00060212]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\n\n<p>Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis, resulting in increased production of platelets, as well as activating osteoclasts, inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and inhibiting macrophage mediator production. These functions may be particularly important in mediating the hematopoietic, osseous and mucosal protective effects of IL-11 [[cite:PUB00013131]]. The cytokine also possesses anti-inflammatory activity, and has been proposed as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis [[cite:PUB00046036]].</p>\n\n<p>Although IL-11 was initially believed to be restricted to mammals, subsequent studies demonstrated it to be expressed in ray-finned fish [[cite:PUB00046037], [cite:PUB00046038]].
