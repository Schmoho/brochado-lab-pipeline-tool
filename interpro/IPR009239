{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the Bacillus species-specific PapR protein. The papR gene belongs to the PlcR regulon and is located 70 bp downstream from plcR. It encodes a 48-amino-acid peptide. Disruption of the papR gene abolishes expression of the PlcR regulon, resulting in a large decrease in haemolysis and virulence in insect larvae. A processed form of PapR activates the PlcR regulon by allowing PlcR to bind to its DNA target. This activating mechanism is strain specific [[cite:PUB00011938]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05968" "Bacillus PapR protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacillus PapR", "short" "Bacillus_PapR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 217, "sets" 0, "proteins" 217, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 140}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009239", :literature {"PUB00011938" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Slamti L" "Lereclus D."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf450", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "A cell-cell signaling peptide activates the PlcR virulence regulon in bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "4550-9", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12198157}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009239", "name" "Bacillus PapR", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 2}}}
