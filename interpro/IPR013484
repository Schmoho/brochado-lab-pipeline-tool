{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MoaB is thought to be involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis, though its exact role is not known. Structural studies of this polypeptide suggest that it may play a role in substrate-shuttling during biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00015825]]. MoaB was capable of binding GTP, and it was suggested that the putative active site could also bind precursor Z and/or molybdenum. Potential protein interaction domains were also found, implying that MoaB may play a transport and/or storage role in molybdopterin biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mkz", "name" "Crystal structure of MoaB protein at 1.6 A resolution."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036425", "name" "MoaB/Mog-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02667" "molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein B, proteobacteria", "short" "MoaB_proteobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2023, "taxa" 8199, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9229, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9229, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7199}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0466", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0466"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013484", :literature {"PUB00015825" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Sanishvili R" "Beasley S" "Skarina T" "Glesne D" "Joachimiak A" "Edwards A" "Savchenko A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
