{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Graf is an essential component of the CLIC (clathrin-independent carrier)/GEEC (GPI-anchored protein-enriched early endocytic compartment) endocytic pathway [[cite:PUB00102273]]. It plays a critical role during development; it is essential for normal mushroom body (MB) development and, therefore, the formation of olfactory long-term memories [[cite:PUB00102274]]. During embryo cellularization, it is required for maintaining and regulating the rate of actomyosin ring constriction [[cite:PUB00102274]].</p>\n\n<p>OPHN1 is a RhoGAP involved in X-linked mental disabilities, epilepsy, rostral ventricular enlargement, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Affected individuals have morphological abnormalities of their brain with enlargement of the cerebral ventricles and cerebellar hypoplasia. OPHN1 negatively regulates RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 in neuronal and non-neuronal cells [[cite:PUB00102269], [cite:PUB00102270]]. GRAF1 sculpts the endocytic membranes of the CLIC/GEEC (clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-enriched early endosomal compartments) endocytic pathway. It strongly interacts with dynamin and inhibition of dynamin abolishes CLIC/GEEC endocytosis [[cite:PUB00102267], [cite:PUB00102268], [cite:PUB00102271]]. Its mutations are linked to leukaemia. GRAF2, GRAF3 and oligophrenin are likely to play similar roles during clathrin-independent endocytic events [[cite:PUB00043118]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12552" "OLIGOPHRENIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GRAF family", "short" "GRAF_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1020, "taxa" 4024, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4644}, "pathways" 68}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047234", :literature {"PUB00102273" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Kim S" "Nahm M" "Kim N" "Kwon Y" "Kim J" "Choi S" "Choi EY" "Shim J" "Lee C" "Lee S."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Graf regulates hematopoiesis through GEEC endocytosis of EGFR.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "4159-4172", "volume" "144", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28993397}, "PUB00102267" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Doherty JT" "Lenhart KC" "Cameron MV" "Mack CP" "Conlon FL" "Taylor JM."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Skeletal muscle differentiation and fusion are regulated by the BAR-containing Rho-GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP), GRAF1.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "25903-21", "volume" "286", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21622574}, "PUB00102272" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sharma S" "Rikhy R."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Spatiotemporal recruitment of RhoGTPase protein GRAF inhibits actomyosin ring constriction in Drosophila cellularization.
