{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Plant seed storage proteins, whose principal function appears to be the major nitrogen source for the developing plant, can be classified, on the basis of their structure, into different families. 11S-type globulins are non-glycosylated proteins which form hexameric structures [[cite:PUB00001358], [cite:PUB00004572]]. Each of the subunits in the hexamer is itself composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor and linked by a disulphide bond. This structure is shown in the following representation.</p>\n\n<pre>\n                   +-------------------------+\n                   |                         |\n        xxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxNGxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n        |------Acidic-subunit-------------||-----Basic-subunit------|\n        |-----------------About-480-to-500-residues-----------------|\n\n'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulphide bond.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Members of the 11-S family include pea and broad bean legumins, oil seed rape cruciferin, rice glutelins, cotton beta-globulins, soybean glycinins, pumpkin 11-S globulin, oat globulin, sunflower helianthinin G3, etc. This family represents the precursor protein which is cleaved into the two chains. These proteins contain two Î²-barrel domains. This family is a member of the 'cupin' superfamily on the basis of their conserved barrel domain ('cupa' is the Latin term for a small barrel).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00439" "11-S seed storage protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "11-S seed storage protein, plant", "short" "11S_seedstore_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 247, "taxa" 1109, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18751, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3616, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2059}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00284", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00284"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006044", :literature {"PUB00001358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hayashi M" "Mori H" "Nishimura M" "Akazawa T" "Hara-Nishimura I."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
