{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPSase) is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a small and a large subunit (with the exception of CPSase III, see below). CPSase catalyses the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from biocarbonate, ATP and glutamine or ammonia, and represents the first committed step in pyrimidine and arginine biosynthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and in the urea cycle in most terrestrial vertebrates [[cite:PUB00006448], [cite:PUB00042597]]. This entry represents the small subunit of the glutamine-dependent form ([ec:6.3.5.5]) of carbamoyl phosphate synthase. The small subunit catalyses the hydrolysis of glutamine to ammonia, which in turn used by the large chain to synthesize carbamoyl phosphate. The C-terminal domain of the small subunit of CPSase has glutamine amidotransferase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1a9x", "name" "CARBAMOYL PHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE: CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF GLUTAMINE HYDROLYSIS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036480", "name" "Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase small subunit, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01368" "glutamine-hydrolyzing carbamoyl-phosphate synthase small subunit"}, "hamap" {"MF_01209" "Carbamoyl phosphate synthase small chain [carA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, small subunit", "short" "CarbamoylP_synth_ssu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11327, "taxa" 46883, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49717, "sets" 0, "proteins" 49715, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33889}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1427", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1427"} {"accession" "GenProp0187", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0187"} {"accession" "GenProp1300", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1300"} {"accession" "GenProp1129", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1129"} {"accession" "GenProp1614", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1614"} {"accession" "GenProp1418", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1418"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
