{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a secreted 17-21kDa protein that is non- glycosylated in humans but exists as a non-covalent homodimer. IL-10 is secreted by some types of T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocytes and macrophages late after antigen activation. Generally, IL-10 inhibits T-cell and natural killer cell synthesis of other cytokines at the transcriptional level, indirectly, by affecting macrophages. These cytokines include interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, tumour necrosis factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The mechanism of IL-10 induced inhibition appears to involve a reduction in the abundance of the macrophage surface molecules that directly stimulate T-cells and natural killer cells. Proteins encoded by viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and equine herpes virus show a high degree of sequence identity to IL-10. These proteins are thought to be involved in evasion of host immune responses. The IL-10 molecule is a tight dimer of 2 interpenetrating subunits that form a V-shaped structure. Each half of the structure consists of 6 Î±-helices (4 from 1 subunit and 2 from the other). Four of the helices form an up-up-down-down bundle, which is observed in all other helical cytokines. The overall topology resembles interferon-gamma.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents interleukin-10.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01294" "INTRLEUKIN10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-10", "short" "IL-10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 585, "taxa" 2161, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3915, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1056, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 669}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00450", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00450"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000098", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005125", "name" "cytokine activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006955", "name" "immune response", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005576", "name" "extracellular region", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020443", "name" "Interleukin-10/19/20/24/26", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000098", "name" "Interleukin-10", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR020421", "name" "Interleukin-19", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR020442", "name" "Interleukin-20", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR020444", "name" "Interleukin-24", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
