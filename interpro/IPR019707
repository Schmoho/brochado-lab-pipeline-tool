The structure of two proteins in this family were solved using NMR and shown to adopt a winged helix-turn-helix fold [[cite:PUB00075673]]. Structural analysis shows that these proteins form an unusual dimeric conformation.  This dimer was shown to be similar to that found in the FadR and TubR wHTH domains. It was suggested [[cite:PUB00075673]] that these proteins are not very likely to bind to DNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10771" "Winged helix-turn-helix domain (DUF2582)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Winged helix-turn-helix domain (DUF2582)", "short" "DUF2582"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 218, "taxa" 1550, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2616, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2550, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2040}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019707", :literature {"PUB00075673" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Eletsky A" "Petrey D" "Zhang QC" "Lee HW" "Acton TB" "Xiao R" "Everett JK" "Prestegard JH" "Honig B" "Montelione GT" "Szyperski T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
