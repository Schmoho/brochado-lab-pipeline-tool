{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Metallothioneins (MTs) are small proteins with a high content of cysteine residues that bind various heavy metals. Plant MTs are classified into four types based on the arrangement of cysteine residues, and all are involved in copper and other metals homeostasis [[cite:PUB00088550], [cite:PUB00088551]]. This entry represents MT3 that in Arabidopsis is predominantly expressed in leaf mesophyll cells. It functions as copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) chelator and plays a role in Cu homeostasis, specifically in the remobilization of Cu from senescing leaves. The mobilization of Cu is important for seed development [[cite:PUB00088550], [cite:PUB00088551]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33357" "METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metallothionein-like protein 3", "short" "MT3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 157, "taxa" 763, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 356}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044671", :literature {"PUB00088550" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Guo WJ" "Meetam M" "Goldsbrough PB."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.115782", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Examining the specific contributions of individual Arabidopsis metallothioneins to copper distribution and metal tolerance.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1697-706", "volume" "146", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18287486}, "PUB00088551" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["R Benatti M" "Yookongkaew N" "Meetam M" "Guo WJ" "Punyasuk N" "AbuQamar S" "Goldsbrough P."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.12718", "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "Metallothionein deficiency impacts copper accumulation and redistribution in leaves and seeds of Arabidopsis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "940-51", "volume" "202", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24635746}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005507", "name" "copper ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006878", "name" "intracellular copper ion homeostasis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044671", "name" "Metallothionein-like protein 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
