{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Triosephosphate isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.1]) (TIM) [[cite:PUB00000326]] is the glycolytic enzyme that catalyses the reversible interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. TIM plays an important role in several metabolic pathways and is essential for efficient energy production, highly conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In pathogenic organisms, this enzyme plays a crucial role obtaining energy for infection and survival. TIM is a dimer of identical subunits, each of which is made up of about 250 amino-acid residues. A glutamic acid residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00004091], [cite:PUB00029041], [cite:PUB00099868]].</p>\n\n<p>The tertiary structure of TIM has eight β/α motifs folded into a barrel structure. The TIM barrel fold occurs ubiquitously and is found in numerous other enzymes that can be involved in energy metabolism, macromolecule metabolism, or small molecule metabolism [[cite:PUB00027646]].</p>\n\n<p>The sequence around the active site residue is perfectly conserved in all known TIM's. Deficiencies in TIM are associated with haemolytic anaemia coupled with a progressive, severe neurological disorder [[cite:PUB00014239]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents archaeal triosephosphate isomerases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5csr", "name" "Crystal structure of triosephosphate isomerase from Thermoplasma acidophilium"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035990", "name" "Triosephosphate isomerase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00147_A" "Triosephosphate isomerase [tpiA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Triosephosphate isomerase, archaeal", "short" "Triosephosphate_isomerase_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 266, "taxa" 1902, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2085, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2085, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1800}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
