{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents UNC-93 from Caenorhabditis elegans, protein unc-93 homologue A (UNC93A) and UNC93-like protein MFSD11 (also called major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 11 or protein ET) from mammals, and similar eukaryotic proteins. UNC-93 colocalises with SUP-10 and SUP-9 within muscle cells. UNC-93 acts as a regulatory subunit of a multi-subunit potassium channel complex that may function in coordinating muscle contraction in C. elegans [[cite:PUB00053696]]. MFSD11 is ubiquitously expressed in the periphery and the central nervous system of mice, where it is expressed in excitatory and inhibitory mouse brain neurons [[cite:PUB00097045]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05978" "Ion channel regulatory protein UNC-93"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ion channel regulatory protein, UNC-93", "short" "Ion_channel_UNC-93"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 171, "proteomes" 2319, "taxa" 9809, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13503, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12782, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7589}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010291", :literature {"PUB00053696" {"URL" nil, "issue" "27", "authors" ["de la Cruz IP" "Levin JZ" "Cummins C" "Anderson P" "Horvitz HR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
