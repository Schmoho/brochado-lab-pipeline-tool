{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the nuclease A inhibitor NuiA expressed by Anabaena sp (NuiA, [swissprot:Q44296]) and similar bacterial proteins. This protein adopts an α+β fold described as an 'open jaw', which shares some similarity to the PR-1-like fold [[cite:PUB00016584]]. NuiA regulates the activity of Nuclease A (NucA). The NucA inhibition by NuiA involves an unusual divalent metal ion bridge that connects the nuclease with its inhibitor. A highly conserved glutamate extends into the active site, mimicking the charge of a phosphate. In addition, a second interaction site located on one of the two 'jaws' of the NuiA structure, contribute to the specificity and strength of the NuiA-NucA interaction [[cite:PUB00042100]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036587", "name" "Nuclease A inhibitor-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07924" "Nuclease A inhibitor-like protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011544" "Nuclease A inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclease A inhibitor-like", "short" "NucleaseA_inhib-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1164, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 824, "sets" 0, "proteins" 802, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 558}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012489", :literature {"PUB00016584" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kirby TW" "Mueller GA" "DeRose EF" "Lebetkin MS" "Meiss G" "Pingoud A" "London RE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
