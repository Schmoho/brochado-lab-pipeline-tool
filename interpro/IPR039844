{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nucleolar pre-ribosomal-associated protein 1 (Npa1) is required for ribosome biogenesis and operates in the same functional environment as Rsa3p and Dbp6p during early maturation of 60S ribosomal subunits [[cite:PUB00053537]]. The protein partners of Npa1p include eight putative helicases as well as the novel Npa2p factor. Npa1p can also associate with a subset of H/ACA and C/D small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) involved in the chemical modification of residues in the vicinity of the peptidyl transferase centre [[cite:PUB00044526]]. The protein has also been referred to as Urb1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13500" "NUCLEOLAR PRERIBOSOMAL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleolar pre-ribosomal-associated protein 1", "short" "URB1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2499, "taxa" 8415, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4948, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4948, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1449}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039844", :literature {"PUB00053537" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Rosado IV" "de la Cruz J."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1261/rna.7340404", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Npa1p is an essential trans-acting factor required for an early step in the assembly of 60S ribosomal subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1073-83", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15208443}, "PUB00044526" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Dez C" "Froment C" "Noaillac-Depeyre J" "Monsarrat B" "Caizergues-Ferrer M" "Henry Y."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
