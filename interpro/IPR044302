Costars has been shown to directly bind to F-actin in vitro, however, it does not associate tightly with either G- or F-actin within the cellular context [[cite:PUB00067376]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038095", "name" "Costars domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46334" "COSTARS FAMILY PROTEIN ABRACL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Costars family", "short" "Costars"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1016, "taxa" 3834, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1515, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1013}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044302", :literature {"PUB00067376" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 21", "authors" ["Pang TL" "Chen FC" "Weng YL" "Liao HC" "Yi YH" "Ho CL" "Lin CH" "Chen MY."], "ISO_journal" "J.
