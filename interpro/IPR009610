{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CbtA is a family of bacterial and archaeal toxins of type IV toxin-antitoxin system. Toxins from such systems in free-living bacteria inhibit cell growth by targeting essential functions of cellular metabolism [[cite:PUB00075542]]. In this case the toxin inhibits cell-division leading to changes in morphology and finally lysis, by interacting with two essential cytoskeletal proteins, FtsZ and MreB. For FtsZ it inhibits its GTPase activity and GTP-dependent polymerisation, and for MreB it inhibits its ATP-dependent polymerisation. These actions of CbtA appear to occur simultaneously [[cite:PUB00075543]]. he cognate antitoxin family is represented by [interpro:IPR009320].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06755" "CbtA_toxin of type IV toxin-antitoxin system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CbtA toxin of type IV toxin-antitoxin system", "short" "CbtA_toxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 54, "taxa" 747, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1953, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1953, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1391}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009610", :literature {"PUB00075542" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Elliott SJ" "Meszaros JG" "Schilling WP."], "ISO_journal" "Free Radic.
