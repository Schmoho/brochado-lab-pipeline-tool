{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribosomal RNA processing protein 8 (Rrp8) is a nucleolar Rossman-fold like methyltransferase. In yeast, it is involved in pre-rRNA cleavage at site A2 [[cite:PUB00078607]] and is responsible for a base methylation of the 25S rRNA [[cite:PUB00078606]]. In humans it is also known as nucleomethylin (NML), and it is important for mediating the assembly of the energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC), which regulates rRNA transcription in response to glucose deprivation [[cite:PUB00078608]]. NML represses rDNA transcription by promoting H3K9 methylation and establishing heterochromatin across the rDNA [[cite:PUB00050320]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zfu", "name" "Structure of the methyltransferase-like domain of nucleomethylin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042036", "name" "Ribosomal RNA-processing protein 8, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12787" "RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 8"}, "pfam" {"PF05148" "Hypothetical methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal RNA processing protein 8", "short" "RRP8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 115, "proteomes" 2507, "taxa" 8817, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4482, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4417, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2835}, "pathways" 151}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
