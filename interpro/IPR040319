{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of zinc finger containing proteins from plants and green algae, including LSD and LOL proteins. LSD (LESION SIMULATING DISEASE1) functions as a negative programmed cell death regulator that integrates various signaling pathways in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses [[cite:PUB00090814]]. It regulates crosstalk between light acclimation and immunity in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00090813]]. LSD1 and LOL1 have antagonistic effects on CSD1 and CSD2 accumulation to regulate oxidative stress-induced cell death [[cite:PUB00020586]]. The rice LOL2 is involved in rice growth and disease resistance [[cite:PUB00090815]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31747" "PROTEIN LSD1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LSD1-like", "short" "LSD1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 301, "taxa" 1352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2164, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2164, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1306}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040319", :literature {"PUB00090813" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Muhlenbock P" "Szechynska-Hebda M" "Plaszczyca M" "Baudo M" "Mateo A" "Mullineaux PM" "Parker JE" "Karpinska B" "Karpinski S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.059618", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Chloroplast signaling and LESION SIMULATING DISEASE1 regulate crosstalk between light acclimation and immunity in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "2339-56", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18790826}, "PUB00090814" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Matuszkiewicz M" "Sobczak M" "Cabrera J" "Escobar C" "Karpinski S" "Filipecki M."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.00314", "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "The Role of Programmed Cell Death Regulator LSD1 in Nematode-Induced Syncytium Formation.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "314", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29616052}, "PUB00020586" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Epple P" "Mack AA" "Morris VR" "Dangl JL."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
