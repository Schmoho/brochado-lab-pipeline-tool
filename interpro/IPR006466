{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This clade of sequences is closely related to MiaB, a modifier of isopentenylated adenosine-37 of certain eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs (see [interpro:IPR006463]). Sequence alignments suggest that this family of sequences perform the same chemical transformation as MiaB, perhaps on a different (or differently modified) tRNA base substrate. This clade represents a subfamily that spans the archaea and eukaryotes.
