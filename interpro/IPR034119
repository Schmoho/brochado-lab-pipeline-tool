{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a bacterial family of homodimeric ethanol dehydrogenases that utilize pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a cofactor [[cite:PUB00000066]]. It represents proteins whose expression may be induced by ethanol, and which are similar to quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenases, but have higher specificities for ethanol and other primary and secondary alcohols. Dehydrogenases with PQQ cofactors, such as ethanol, methanol, and membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenases, form an 8-bladed Î²-propeller [[cite:PUB00080523], [cite:PUB00024967]].</p>\n\n<p>Characterised proteins in this entry includes QedH from Pseudomonas putida [[cite:PUB00082701], [cite:PUB00082699]] and Boh from Thauera butanivorans [[cite:PUB00093962]]. Other characterised members are exaF that catalyses the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde or acetate, but only in the presence of lanthanides [[cite:PUB00154494], [cite:PUB00154496]]; PedE and PedH that catalyses the oxidation of a range of substrates, including linear and aromatic primary and secondary alcohols, as well as aldehydes, but only in the presence of lanthanides, allowing bacterial growth with a variety of volatile organic compounds as carbon and energy sources [[cite:PUB00154495]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6zcw", "name" "Crystal structure of lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase PedH from Pseudomonas putida KT2440"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011047", "name" "Quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10277" "Ethanol dehydrogenase, a bacterial quinoprotein (PQQ-dependent type I alcohol dehydrogenase)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PQQ-dependent type I alcohol dehydrogenase", "short" "ADHI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 489, "taxa" 2281, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2671, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2671, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2167}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
