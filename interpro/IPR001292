{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands [[cite:PUB00015853]]. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner [[cite:PUB00004464], [cite:PUB00006168]]. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed 'orphan' receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The oestrogen receptors (ERs) are steroid or nuclear hormone receptors that act as transcription regulators involved in diverse physiological functions. Oestrogen receptors function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner. The ER consists of three functional and structural domains: an N-terminal modulatory domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that recognises specific sequences ([interpro:IPR001628]), and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain ([interpro:IPR000536]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The N-terminal modulatory domain spans the first 180 residues and contains the activation function 1 (AF1) region.

There is another activation function region, namely AF2, which resides in the C-terminal end of the ligand-binding domain. Transcription activation is facilitated by both AF1 and AF2, which appear to act synergistically in the ER complex [[cite:PUB00016725], [cite:PUB00016726]]. For example, the ER can recruit TIF2 (transcription intermediary factor 2) via the AF1 and AF2 regions, whose synergistic action results in the activation of transcription.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00543" "Oestrogen receptor"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF500101" "Estrogen receptor alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Estrogen receptor", "short" "Estr_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 504, "taxa" 1966, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3255, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1320, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 916}, "pathways" 71}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001292", :literature {"PUB00004464" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Nishikawa J" "Kitaura M" "Imagawa M" "Nishihara T."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/23.4.606", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Vitamin D receptor contains multiple dimerization interfaces that are functionally different.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "606-11", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7899080}, "PUB00015853" {"URL" nil, "issue" "217", "authors" ["Schwabe JW" "Teichmann SA."], "ISO_journal" "Sci.
