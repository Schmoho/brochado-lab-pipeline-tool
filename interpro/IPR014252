{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family resemble the widely distributed ATP-dependent protease La, also called Lon and LonA. They resemble even more closely LonB, which is a LonA paralog found in genomes of species capable of endospore formation (such as Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium tetani, and select other members of the Firmicutes) and expressed specifically in the forespore compartment. Members of this family are restricted to a subset of spore-forming species, and are very likely to participate in the program of endospore formation. We propose the designation LonC.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02903" "ATP-dependent protease, Lon family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation protease LonC", "short" "Spore_LonC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 220, "taxa" 774, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 715, "sets" 0, "proteins" 715, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 558}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014252", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014252", "name" "Sporulation protease LonC", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
