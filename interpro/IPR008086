{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of serine protease inhibitors belong to MEROPS inhibitor family I15, clan IO. They inhibit serine peptidases of the S1 family ([interpro:IPR001254]) [[cite:PUB00014133]] and are characterised by a well conserved pattern of cysteine residues. This is a family of leech anti-coagulants.</p>\n\n<p>Antistasin is a 15kDa protein found in the salivary glands of Haementeria officinalis (Mexican leech); it is an anticoagulant that functions by inhibiting factor Xa. The protein contains 119 residues, with an unusually high cysteine content (20 residues in all), and exhibits a 2-fold internal repeated structure. Four isoforms of antistasin have been identified in leech salivary gland extracts; partial sequence analysis indicates that these isoforms differ only by 1 or 2 amino acid residues [[cite:PUB00010274]].</p>\n\n<p>Ghilanten is an anticoagulant-antimetastatic protein of Haementeria ghilianii (Amazon leech). Like antistasin, it contains 119 amino acids, with 20 cysteines, and a heparin-binding consensus motif at its C terminus. Arginine-34 is the residue involved in the active-site inhibition of trypsin and Factor Xa [[cite:PUB00010268]].</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structure of antistasin has been determined to 1.9A resolution by X-ray crystallography [[cite:PUB00010320]]. The structure reveals a novel protein fold comprising two similar domains, which can be divided into two similarly sized subdomains, with different relative orientations. Thus, the domain shapes differ, the N-terminal domain being wedge-shaped and the C-terminal domain flat [[cite:PUB00010320]]. Docking studies suggest that it is differences in domain shape that enable the N-terminal domain to bind and inhibit factor Xa, rather than the C-terminal domain, despite very similar active sites. A putative exosite binding region is evident in the N-terminal domain (residues 15-17), which is likely to interact with a cluster of positively charged residues on the factor Xa surface (Arg222/Lys223/Lys224), explaining the specificity and inhibitory potency of antistasin towards factor Xa.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1bx7", "name" "HIRUSTASIN FROM HIRUDO MEDICINALIS AT 1.2 ANGSTROMS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011061", "name" "Hirudin/antistatin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01706" "ANTISTASIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteinase inhibitor I15, leech antistasin", "short" "Prot_inh_I15_antistasin_leech"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 28, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008086", :literature {"PUB00010268" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Blankenship DT" "Brankamp RG" "Manley GD" "Cardin AD."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
