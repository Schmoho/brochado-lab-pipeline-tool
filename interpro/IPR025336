{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins found in prokaryotes, including SCO4226 from Streptomyces coelicolor ([swissprot:Q9FCE4]). This protein adopts a dimeric configuration able to bind four nickel ions, with each monomer showing a typical ferredoxin-like fold with five β-strands packing against two α-helices. It may play a role in cellular nickel homeostasis, detoxification, and/or nickel utilization in specialized cytoplasmic compartment [[cite:PUB00093075]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4oi3", "name" "Crystal structure analysis of SCO4226 from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042557", "name" "SCO4226, nickel-binding ferredoxin-like monomer", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14026" "Nickel responsive protein SCO4226-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SCO4226-like", "short" "SCO4226-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 1267, "taxa" 5740, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6296, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6247, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4934}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025336", :literature {"PUB00093075" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Lu M" "Jiang YL" "Wang S" "Jin H" "Zhang RG" "Virolle MJ" "Chen Y" "Zhou CZ."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Streptomyces coelicolor SCO4226 is a nickel binding protein.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e109660", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25285530}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025336", "name" "SCO4226-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 69, "alignment:full" 1560}}}
