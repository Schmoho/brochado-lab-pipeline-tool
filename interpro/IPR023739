{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phenylpropanoid compounds are widely available in natural environments, and they can originate from putrefaction of proteins in soil or as breakdown products of several constituents of plants, such as lignin, various oils, and resins. Microbial catabolism of phenylpropanoid compounds plays an important role not only in the natural degradative cycle of these aromatic molecules but also in their industrial applications such as wine making, aging, and storage. In particular, degradation of cinnamic acid (CI), 3-phenylpropionic acid (PP), and their hydroxylated derivatives has been reported in several bacteria, including Pseudomonas species [[cite:PUB00053145]], Arthrobacter species [[cite:PUB00053145]], Escherichia coli (strain K12) [[cite:PUB00053146]], and Rhodococcus globerulus [[cite:PUB00053147]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the ferredoxin subunit (HcaC).
