{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins expressed by various epithelial cell types. They can be divided into two classes according to cellular localisation: membrane-bound mucins and secretory mucins. This entry represents Mucin-15 (MUC15) which is a cell membrane-associated mucin. The predicted protein product of human MUC15 contains an extracelluar domain, a small transmembrane domain, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail [[cite:PUB00075740]]. Mucin-15 is expressed in human placenta and may play a role in the regulation of trophoblast invasion [[cite:PUB00075741]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45427" "MUCIN-15"}, "pfam" {"PF15672" "Cell-membrane associated Mucin15"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell-membrane associated Mucin-15", "short" "Mucin-15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 384, "taxa" 1540, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 620, "sets" 0, "proteins" 583, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 400}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031371", :literature {"PUB00075740" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Pallesen LT" "Berglund L" "Rasmussen LK" "Petersen TE" "Rasmussen JT."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
