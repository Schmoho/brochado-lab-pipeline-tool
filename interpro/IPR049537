{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of prokaryotic proteins, including antitoxin RelB from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. RelE-RelB (RelBE) is a toxin-antitoxin (TA) protein complex. It is suggested that the toxic action of RelE is counteracted by antitoxin RelB, which wraps around RelE, blocks its active site and prevents sterically the binding to the ribosomal A-site. The long  α-helix of the tightly bound antitoxin RelB covers the presumed active site of the toxin RelE that is formed by a central β-sheet [[cite:PUB00091478]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF18506" "RelB Antitoxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Antitoxin RelB-like", "short" "RelB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 85, "taxa" 913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 567, "sets" 0, "proteins" 567, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 422}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049537", :literature {"PUB00091478" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Francuski D" "Saenger W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
