{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Selenium is an important nutrient which needs to be regulated since lack of the nutrient leads to cell abnormalities and high concentrations are toxic. The selenium binding protein (SeBP) regulates the level of free selenium in the cell by sequestering the nutrient during transport. SeBP acts as a pentamer and delivers the selenium to the selenophosphate synthetase enzyme [[cite:PUB00048148]]. Each subunit is composed of an Î± helix on top of a four stranded twisted ss sheet, stabilised by hydrogen bonds [[cite:PUB00048148]]. Proteins in this entry are restricted to the archaeal  Methanococcales.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038549", "name" "SeBP-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03884" "selenium-binding protein"}, "pfam" {"PF11524" "Selenium binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenium-binding protein, archaea", "short" "SeBP_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021603", :literature {"PUB00048148" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Suzuki M" "Lee DY" "Inyamah N" "Stadtman TC" "Tjandra N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
