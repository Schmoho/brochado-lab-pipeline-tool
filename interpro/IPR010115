{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes 2-phospho-L-lactate transferase (CofD), which catalyses the transfer of the 2-phospholactate moiety from (2S)-lactyl-2-diphospho-5'-guanosine to 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO), and phosphoenolpyruvate transferase (FbiA) which catalyses the transfer of the phosphoenolpyruvate moiety from enoylpyruvoyl-2-diphospho-5'-guanosine (EPPG) to 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) with the formation of dehydro coenzyme F420-0 and GMP [[cite:PUB00093753]]. F420 is a hydride carrier, important for energy metabolism of methanogenic archaea, as well as for the biosynthesis of other natural products, like tetracycline in Streptomyces. F420 and some of its precursors are also utilized as cofactors for enzymes, like DNA photolyase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [[cite:PUB00050875], [cite:PUB00013496]].  F420 is found in methanogens, Mycobacteria, and several other lineages. This enzyme is characterised so far in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) [[cite:PUB00013496]] but appears restricted to F420-containing species and is predicted to carry out the same function in these other species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038136", "name" "CofD-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07186" "LPPG:FO 2-phospho-L-lactate transferase; important in F420 biosynthesis"}, "hamap" {"MF_01257" "Phosphoenolpyruvate transferase [fbiA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01819" "2-phospho-L-lactate transferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR43007" "2-PHOSPHO-L-LACTATE TRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoenolpyruvate transferase/2-phospho-L-lactate transferase", "short" "FbiA/CofD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1889, "taxa" 6860, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8233, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8233, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6301}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0791", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0791"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
