{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains carbonic anhydrase related proteins (CARPs) X and XI, which have been implicated in various biological processes of the central nervous system. CARPs are sequence similar to carbonic anhydrases. Carbonic anhydrases are zinc-containing enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in a two-step mechanism. CARPs have lost conserved histidines involved in zinc binding and consequently their catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00092029]]. CARP XI plays a role in the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors [[cite:PUB00044817]].  Phylogeny shows that CARP XI emerged from CARP X [[cite:PUB00092031]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036398", "name" "Alpha carbonic anhydrase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03121" "alpha_CARP_X_XI_like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbonic anhydrase-related protein X/XI", "short" "Alpha_CARP_X/XI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 483, "taxa" 2186, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1550, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1550, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 920}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041878", :literature {"PUB00092031" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Aspatwar A" "Tolvanen ME" "Parkkila S."], "ISO_journal" "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3109/14756366.2012.727813", "medline_journal" "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem", "title" "An update on carbonic anhydrase-related proteins VIII, X and XI.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1129-42", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23294106}, "PUB00044817" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Morimoto K" "Nishimori I" "Takeuchi T" "Kohsaki T" "Okamoto N" "Taguchi T" "Yunoki S" "Watanabe R" "Ohtsuki Y" "Onishi S."], "ISO_journal" "Virchows Arch.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00428-005-1225-3", "medline_journal" "Virchows Arch", "title" "Overexpression of carbonic anhydrase-related protein XI promotes proliferation and invasion of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "66-73", "volume" "447", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15942747}, "PUB00092029" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Aspatwar A" "Tolvanen ME" "Ortutay C" "Parkkila S."], "ISO_journal" "Subcell.
