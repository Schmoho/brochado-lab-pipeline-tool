The protein was shown to share high sequence similarity with hypothetical proteins in other archaeal and bacterial genomes, several of which form a monophyletic cluster within the broad superfamily of ferritin-like diiron-carboxylate proteins, which are non-haem iron storage proteins [[cite:PUB00016871]].</p>\n\n<p>The S. solfataricus Dps-like protein has been shown to self-assemble into a hollow dodecameric protein cage having tetrahedral symmetry, which uses H2O2 to oxidize Fe(II) to Fe(III), storing the oxide as a mineral core on the interior surface of the protein cage. It may be involved in the mitigation of oxidative damage [[cite:PUB00081827]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8w1d", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF DPS-LIKE PROTEIN PA4880 FROM PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA (DIMERIC FORM)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF018063" "Uncharacterised protein with ferritin fold"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding protein from starved cells-like", "short" "Dps-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 634, "taxa" 4149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3894, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3881, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3116}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014490", :literature {"PUB00016871" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5 Suppl 1", "authors" ["Theil EC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
