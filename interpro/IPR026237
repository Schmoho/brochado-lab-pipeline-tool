{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The life-cycle of Dictyostelium consists of two distinct phases: growth and development [[cite:PUB00060258]]. The control of the growth-differentiation transition (GDT) is not fully understood, and only a handful of genes involved in the process have been elucidated. Amongst these is a family containing at least 9 closely related genes, of which gdt1 and gdt2 were the first members to be identified [[cite:PUB00060258], [cite:PUB00060259]]. It is thought that the different family members may control similar cellular processes, but respond to different environmental cues [[cite:PUB00060258]].</p>\r\n<p>The gdt1 and gdt2 gene products, GDT1 and GDT2, are similar in many ways, but there are important differences. GDT1 is a 175kDa protein with 4 putative transmembrane (TM) domains [[cite:PUB00060259]]. The C-terminal amino acid sequence shares some similarity with the catalytic domain of protein kinases; while this domain is well conserved in GDT2, it is thought to be non-functional in GDT1 [[cite:PUB00060258]]. Similar observations have been made for other family members: hence, for example, GDT3 and GDT4 encode complete well conserved kinase domains, and are therefore probably functional [[cite:PUB00060258]]; conversely, GDT6 and GDT8 appear to encode proteins with degenerate protein kinase domains; and the C-terminal sequence of GDT5 seems unrelated to protein kinases, while GDT7 appears to be truncated, and stops before the protein kinase domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02079" "Probable serine/threonine-protein kinase GDT family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable serine/threonine-protein kinase GDT family", "short" "STKINASEGDT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 37, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 83, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
