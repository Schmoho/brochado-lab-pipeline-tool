{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins predominantly found in fungi and bacteria, including Gig2 from Candida albicans ([swissprot:A0A1D8PEJ2]) and Uncharacterized protein YbiU from Escherichia coli. Gig2 is a putative oxidoreductase thought to play a role in the undefined GlcNAc metabolic network. It folds into a single large domain with a cupin like double stranded β-helix core made of eight β-sheets grouped into four major and four minor sheets, which form the distorted β-barrel open at one end, surrounded by 20 α-helices. This protein shows similarity with 2- oxoglutarate dependent Fe containing oxygenases [[cite:PUB00100975]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7twc", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Putative Oxidoreductase of DUF1479-containing Protein Family YPO2976 from Yersinia pestis Bound to CAPS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027443", "name" "Isopenicillin N synthase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07350" "Gig2-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR30613" "UNCHARACTERIZED PROTEIN YBIU-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gig2-like", "short" "Gig2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 56, "proteomes" 1227, "taxa" 4435, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5420, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5291, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3518}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010856", :literature {"PUB00100975" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Rani P" "Gautam G" "Anwar T" "Gourinath S" "Datta A."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Biol Macromol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Biol Macromol", "title" "Crystal structure of Gig2 protein from Candida albicans provides a structural insight into DUF1479 family oxygenases.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1272-1280", "volume" "150", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31743702}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010856", "name" "Gig2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 23, "alignment:full" 1851}}}
