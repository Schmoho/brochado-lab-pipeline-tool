{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins including Hemolysin coregulated protein, Hcp (also known as TssD).</p>\n\n<p>Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are multiprotein complexes requiring numerous core proteins (Tss proteins) that function as a toxin delivery systems. The core Tss proteins include cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and outer membrane components. The toxin delivery apparatus includes a needle or tube structure which functions as a puncturing device. This is comprised of a phage-like complex, similar to the T4 contractile bacteriophage tail, which is thought to be anchored to the membrane by a trans-envelope complex. The inner tube is formed of Hcp (TssD), assembled as stacked hexamers [[cite:PUB00090998]]. Hcp proteins have also been reported to function as chaperones, by binding to and stabilizing effectors [[cite:PUB00091563]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7yw0", "name" "Bacteroides fragilis Hcp5"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17642" "Hemolysin coregulated protein Hcp (TssD)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp) TssD", "short" "Hcp_Tssd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 23, "proteomes" 190, "taxa" 1009, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3003, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2989, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2441}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041408", :literature {"PUB00090998" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Coyne MJ" "Roelofs KG" "Comstock LE."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Genomics", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-2377-z", "medline_journal" "BMC Genomics", "title" "Type VI secretion systems of human gut Bacteroidales segregate into three genetic architectures, two of which are contained on mobile genetic elements.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "58", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26768901}, "PUB00091563" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Silverman JM" "Agnello DM" "Zheng H" "Andrews BT" "Li M" "Catalano CE" "Gonen T" "Mougous JD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
