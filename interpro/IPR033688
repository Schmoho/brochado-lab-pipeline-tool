{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA cytidine acetyltransferase NAT10 has specificity toward both 18S rRNA and tRNAs and catalyzes the formation of N(4)-acetylcytidine at two positions in 18S rRNA. NAT10 is required for early nucleolar cleavages of precursor rRNA at sites A0, A1 and A2 during 18S rRNA synthesis [[cite:PUB00077545], [cite:PUB00076725]]. NAT10 also catalyzes the formation of N(4)-acetylcytidine at a single position in serine and leucine tRNAs. The tRNA-binding adapter protein TAN1 is required for full tRNA acetyltransferase activity but not for 18S rRNA acetylation [[cite:PUB00076725]].</p>\r\n<p>Human NAT10 is a lysine acetyltransferase that targets microtubules and histones, and plays an important role in cell division.
