{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are the PhnF protein associated with C-P lyase systems for utilization of phosphonates. These systems resemble phosphonatase-based systems in having a three-component ABC transporter, where [interpro:IPR005769] is the permease, [interpro:IPR005770] is the phosphonates binding protein, and [interpro:IPR012693] is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein. They differ, however, in having, typically, ten or more additional genes, many of which are believed to form a membrane-associated C-P lyase complex. This protein (PhnF) is a predicted helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulatory protein of the broader GntR family [[cite:PUB00062386]], and is encoded in a gene cluster associated with genes for the import and degradation of phosphonates and/or related compounds (e.g. phosphonites) with a direct C-P bond. Its presence is apparently not required for phosphate utilisation to occur [[cite:PUB00016017]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2fa1", "name" "Crystal structure of PhnF C-terminal domain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028978", "name" "Chorismate pyruvate-lyase/UbiC transcription regulator-associated domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02325" "phosphonate metabolism transcriptional regulator PhnF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonate C-P lyase system, transcriptional regulator PhnF", "short" "CP_lyase_PhnF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 991, "taxa" 4518, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4336, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4336, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3424}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012702", :literature {"PUB00016017" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Metcalf WW" "Wanner BL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
