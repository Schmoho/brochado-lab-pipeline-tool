{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins, including HIPP01/3/5/6 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00082320]].

HIPP06, also known as CdI19, plays an important role in the maintenance of heavy metal homeostasis and/or in detoxification by endowing plasma membranes with the capacity to serve as an initial barrier against inflow of free heavy metal ions into cells [[cite:PUB00096509]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46413" "HEAVY METAL-ASSOCIATED ISOPRENYLATED PLANT PROTEIN 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein 1/3/5/6", "short" "HIPP01/3/5/6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 949, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2161, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2161, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1363}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044594", :literature {"PUB00082320" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["de Abreu-Neto JB" "Turchetto-Zolet AC" "de Oliveira LF" "Zanettini MH" "Margis-Pinheiro M."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.12159", "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein (HIPP): characterization of a family of proteins exclusive to plants.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1604-16", "volume" "280", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23368984}, "PUB00096508" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zschiesche W" "Barth O" "Daniel K" "Bohme S" "Rausche J" "Humbeck K."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "The zinc-binding nuclear protein HIPP3 acts as an upstream regulator of the salicylate-dependent plant immunity pathway and of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1084-96", "volume" "207", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25913773}, "PUB00096509" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Suzuki N" "Yamaguchi Y" "Koizumi N" "Sano H."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Functional characterization of a heavy metal binding protein CdI19 from Arabidopsis.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "165-73", "volume" "32", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12383082}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046872", "name" "metal ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044594", "name" "Heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein 1/3/5/6", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
