{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents serine/threonine-protein kinases ([ec:2.7.11.1]) such as Unc-51 from Caenorhabditis elegans. Unc-51 is important for axonal elongation and axonal guidance [[cite:PUB00042769]]. It is required for either the maintenance of axons (membrane turnover) or for an unknown neuronal function. C elegans worms lacking Unc-51 exhibit various abnormalities in axonal elongation and axonal structures. Unc-51 could also help control cell size along with Bec-1, as mutations in their corresponding genes results in a reduction in small body size without affecting cell number [[cite:PUB00042770]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037369" "Serine/threonine-protein kinase unc-51"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine/threonine-protein kinase Unc-51", "short" "Ser/Thr_kinase_Unc51"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 77, "taxa" 464, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 201, "sets" 0, "proteins" 149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 109}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
