{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins that are related to the phage T4 Protein Cef (also known as MotC, [swissprot:Q01436]). This protein adopts a compact globular domain composed of 5 β-strands and one α-helix. The β-strands adopt the order 1-5-4-3-2 with the α-helix found between strands 1 and 2. This family shows structural similarity to [interpro:IPR055744]. T4 Cef plays a role in the processing of a cluster of viral tRNAs [[cite:PUB00160018]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24050" "Phage T4 Cef protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage T4 Cef protein", "short" "T4_Cef"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 38, "taxa" 742, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 514, "sets" 0, "proteins" 514, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056952", :literature {"PUB00160018" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pulitzer JF" "Colombo M" "Ciaramella M."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(85)90343-2", "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "New control elements of bacteriophage T4 pre-replicative transcription.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "249-63", "volume" "182", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3999145}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056952", "name" "Phage T4 Cef protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 24, "alignment:full" 63}}}
