{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several short bacterial and phage proteins which are related to the E. coli protein AlpA. AlpA suppresses two phenotypes of a delta lon protease mutant, overproduction of capsular polysaccharide and sensitivity to UV light. AlpA acts as a transcriptional regulator of the slpA gene; activation of slpA transcription is necessary to suppress these phenotypes [[cite:PUB00011917]]. Several of the sequences in this family are thought to be DNA-binding proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05930" "Prophage CP4-57 regulatory protein (AlpA)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding transcriptional activator AlpA", "short" "AlpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 1896, "taxa" 9166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17801, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17789, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13369}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010260", :literature {"PUB00011917" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Trempy JE" "Kirby JE" "Gottesman S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
