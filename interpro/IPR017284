It functions as a homodimer.  Tautomerase PptA can use enol isomers of phenylpyruvate, 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoate and (p-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate as substrates. It is inhibited by (E)-2-fluoro-p-hydroxycinnamate [[cite:PUB00025426]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gyy", "name" "The Crystal Structure of YdcE, a 4-Oxalocrotonate Tautomerase Homologue from Escherichia coli, Confirms the Structural Basis for Oligomer Diversity"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014347", "name" "Tautomerase/MIF superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00718" "Tautomerase PptA [pptA]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037799" "Predicted tautomerase, YdcE type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tautomerase PptA", "short" "Tautomerase_PptA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 180, "taxa" 1404, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 693}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
