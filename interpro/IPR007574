{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus species PCC 7942 ([swissprot:P35087]), nblA triggers degradation of light-harvesting phycobiliproteins in response to deprivation nutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. The mechanism of nblA function is not known, but it has been hypothesised that nblA may act by disrupting phycobilisome structure, activating a protease or tagging phycobiliproteins for proteolysis. Members of this family have also been identified in the chloroplasts of some red algae.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ojh", "name" "Crystal structure of NblA from PCC 7120"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036904", "name" "Phycobilisome degradation protein NblA superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04485" "Phycobilisome degradation protein nblA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phycobilisome degradation protein NblA", "short" "NblA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 178, "taxa" 1581, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1441, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1441, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 980}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007574", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007574", "name" "Phycobilisome degradation protein NblA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 48, "alignment:full" 404}}}
