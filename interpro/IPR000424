{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Escherichia coli single-strand binding protein [[cite:PUB00003606]] (gene ssb), also known as the helix-destabilising protein, is a protein of 177 amino acids. It binds tightly, as a homotetramer, to single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and plays an important role in DNA replication, recombination and repair. Closely related variants of SSB are encoded in the genome of a variety of large self-transmissible plasmids. SSB has also been characterized in bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens. Eukaryotic mitochondrial proteins that bind ss-DNA and are probably involved in mitochondrial DNA replication are structurally and evolutionary related to prokaryotic SSB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primosomal replication protein N (PriB) is a specialist protein from bacteria that binds single-stranded DNA at the primosome assembly site (PAS).  The primosome is a mobile multiprotein replication priming complex which is believe to operate on the lagging-strand template at the E. coli DNA replication fork [[cite:PUB00054931]].  The primosome consists of one monomer of PriC and DnaT, two monomers of PriA, two dimers of PriB and one hexamer of DnaB [[cite:PUB00054930]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3klw", "name" "Crystal structure of primosomal replication protein n from Bordetella pertussis. northeast structural genomics consortium target ber132."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04496" "SSB_OBF"}, "profile" {"PS50935" "Single-strand binding (SSB) domain profile"}, "pfam" {"PF00436" "Single-strand binding protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Primosome PriB/single-strand DNA-binding", "short" "Primosome_PriB/ssb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 80, "domain_architectures" 138, "proteomes" 12370, "taxa" 48039, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 92273, "sets" 0, "proteins" 91021, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 67760}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00602", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00602"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000424", :literature {"PUB00003606" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Meyer RR" "Laine PS."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
