{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the catalytic subunit of histone acetyltransferase type B ([ec:2.3.1.48]) (also known as HAT1), which is the catalytic component of the histone acetylase B (HAT-B) complex [[cite:PUB00044716], [cite:PUB00044717], [cite:PUB00044718]]. The HAT-B complex is composed of at least HAT1 and HAT2. In the cytoplasm, this complex binds to the histone H4 tail. In the nucleus, the HAT-B complex has an additional component, the histone H3/H4 chaperone HIF1.</p>\r\n<p>This enzyme acetylates soluble but not nucleosomal H4 at Lys-12, which is required for telomeric silencing. HAT1 has intrinsic substrate specificity that modifies lysine in recognition sequence GXGKXG. It is involved in DNA double-strand break repair [[cite:PUB00063095]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vo5", "name" "Crystal structure of Human histone acetytransferas 1 (HAT1) in complex with isobutryl-COA and K12A mutant variant of histone H4"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013523", "name" "Histone acetyltransferase HAT1, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037113", "name" "Histone acetyl transferase 1, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038084" "Histone acetyltransferase type B, catalytic subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR12046" "HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE TYPE B CATALYTIC SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone acetyltransferase type B, catalytic subunit", "short" "Hist_AcTrfase_B-typ_cat-su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2496, "taxa" 8690, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4739, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4697, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3130}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
