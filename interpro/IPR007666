{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Although ATP is the most common phosphoryl group donor for kinases, certain hyperthermophilic archaea, such as Thermococcus litoralis and Pyrococcus furiosus, utilise unusual ADP-dependent glucokinases (ADPGKs) and phosphofructokinases (ADPPKKs) in their glycolytic pathways [[cite:PUB00025218], [cite:PUB00026897], [cite:PUB00031716]]. ADPGKs and ADPPFKs exhibit significant similarity, and form an ADP-dependent kinase (ADPK) family, which was tentatively named the PFKC family [[cite:PUB00013528]]. A ~460-residue ADPK domain is also found in a bifunctional ADP-dependent gluco/phosphofructo-kinase (ADP-GK/PFK) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) as well as in homologous proteins present in several eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00015867], [cite:PUB00099921]]. Structure determination for eukaryotic ADPGK revealed an overall similar fold to archaeal orthologues with some differences in secondary structural elements. In the nucleotide-binding loop of eukaryotic ADPGK there is a disulfide bond between conserved cysteines; one of the cysteines coordinating the AMP defines an apparently nucleotide-binding motif unique to eukaryotic ADPGKs. Mammalian enzymes are specific for glucose [[cite:PUB00099921]].</p>\n\n<p>The whole structure of the ADPK domain can be divided into large and small α/β subdomains. The larger subdomain, which carries the ADP binding site, consists of a twisted 12-stranded β-sheet flanked on both faces by 13 α-helices and three 3(10) helices, forming an α/β 3-layer sandwich. The smaller subdomain, which covers the active site, forms an α/β two-layer structure containing 5 bβ-strands and four α-helices. The ADP molecule is buried in a shallow pocket in the large subdomain. The binding of substrate sugar induces a structural change, the small domain closing to form a complete substrate sugar binding site [[cite:PUB00025218], [cite:PUB00026897], [cite:PUB00031716]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5o0j", "name" "ADP-dependent glucokinase from Pyrococcus horikoshii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029056", "name" "Ribokinase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21208" "ADP-DEPENDENT GLUCOKINASE"}, "pfam" {"PF04587" "ADP-specific Phosphofructokinase/Glucokinase conserved region"}, "profile" {"PS51255" "ADP-dependent kinase (ADPK) domain profile"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-specific phosphofructokinase/glucokinase", "short" "ADP_PFK/GK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 42, "proteomes" 1187, "taxa" 5259, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3398, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3380, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2405}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC51255", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC51255"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1522", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1522"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
