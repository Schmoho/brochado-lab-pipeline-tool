{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the family E of the E2/UBC superfamily of proteins found in diverse bacteria. Analysis of the active site residues suggest that members of this family are inactive as they lack the characteristic catalytic residues of the E2 enzymes [[cite:PUB00034476], [cite:PUB00057888]]. They are usually fused to or in the neighbourhood of a multi/poly ubiquitin domain protein. Other proteins of the ubiquitin modification pathway such as the E1 and JAB proteins are also found in its gene neighbourhood along with a distinct predicted metal-binding protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14462" "Prokaryotic E2 family E"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2, family E", "short" "UBQ-conjugat_E2_E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 177, "taxa" 1585, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 832, "sets" 0, "proteins" 832, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 644}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025701", :literature {"PUB00034476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-7-r60", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The prokaryotic antecedents of the ubiquitin-signaling system and the early evolution of ubiquitin-like beta-grasp domains.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "R60", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16859499}, "PUB00057888" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Burroughs AM" "Jaffee M" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
