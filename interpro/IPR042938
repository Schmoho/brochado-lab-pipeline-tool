{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In budding yeasts, Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are defined by their ability to transfer phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) or phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) monomers between membrane bilayers in vitro. The major PITP is encoded by SEC14. However, four other yeast SFH (Sec Fourteen Homologue) proteins designated Sfh2, Sfh3, Sfh4, and Sfh5, have been identified [[cite:PUB00093503]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents Sfh5 from fungi, a non-classical PITP. It has PtdIns transfer activity in vitro and may function in regulation of post-Golgi membrane trafficking events [[cite:PUB00093503], [cite:PUB00093505]]. It is also involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton [[cite:PUB00093504]]. Sfh5 is a novel heme-binding protein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure which penta-coordinates high spin Fe3. It is conserved across Fungi and may play a role organic oxidant-induced stress responses, being the founding member of a new class of hemoproteins [[cite:PUB00098777]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036865", "name" "CRAL-TRIO lipid binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47669" "PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL TRANSFER PROTEIN SFH5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sfh5", "short" "Sfh5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 931, "taxa" 2503, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1398, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1398, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 899}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042938", :literature {"PUB00098777" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Khan D" "Lee D" "Gulten G" "Aggarwal A" "Wofford J" "Krieger I" "Tripathi A" "Patrick JW" "Eckert DM" "Laganowsky A" "Sacchettini J" "Lindahl P" "Bankaitis VA."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "A Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein paralog defines a novel class of heme-binding proteins.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32780017}, "PUB00093503" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Li X" "Routt SM" "Xie Z" "Cui X" "Fang M" "Kearns MA" "Bard M" "Kirsch DR" "Bankaitis VA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
