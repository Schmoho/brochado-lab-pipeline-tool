{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of tryptophan halogenases from bacteria and related halogenases from eukaryotes such as fungi and Dictyostelium [[cite:PUB00081445]].</p>\n\n<p>The bacterial flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase PrnA catalyses the chlorination of tryptophan to form 7-chlorotryptophan [[cite:PUB00039358]]. The halogenase PltM from the soil bacteria Pseudomonas protegens, catalyses the chlorination of the intermediate compound phloroglucinol to form PG-Cl and PG-Cl2 during antibiotics synthesis, toxic to other bacteria or fungi. These chlorinated compounds regulate the synthesis of a second antibiotic, pyoluteorin [[cite:PUB00095415]].</p>\n\n<p>The halogenase gsfI of Penicillium aethiopicum is required for the biosynthesis of the antifungal griseofulvin, a drug used to treat dermatophyte infections. Halogenase gsfI chlorinates the intermediate compound griseophenone C to former another intermediate, griseophenone B [[cite:PUB00080713]]. Sulochrin halogenase from Aspergillus terreus converts sulochrin to dihydrogeodin, a step in the biosynthesis of geodin [[cite:PUB00081405]].</p>\n\n<p>The halogenase OtaD, also known as Ochratoxin biosynthesis cluster protein 5, is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin demonstrated to have nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, genotoxic, neurotoxic, and teratogenic properties [[cite:PUB00099617], [cite:PUB00099616]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2weu", "name" "Crystal structure of tryptophan 5-halogenase (PyrH) complex with substrate tryptophan"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04820" "Tryptophan halogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flavin-dependent halogenase", "short" "Flavin_halogenase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 70, "proteomes" 1839, "taxa" 7726, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18857, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15904, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12047}, "pathways" 149}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
