{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Metallothioneins (MT) are small proteins that bind heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, etc. They have a high content of cysteine residues that bind the metal ions through clusters of thiolate bonds [[cite:PUB00000300], [cite:PUB00001490], [cite:PUB00003570]]. The metallothionein superfamily comprises all polypeptides that resemble equine renal metallothionein in several respects, e.g. low molecular weight; high metal content; amino acid composition with high Cys and low aromatic residue content; unique sequence with characteristic distribution of cysteines, and spectroscopic manifestations indicative of metal thiolate clusters. A MT family subsumes MTs that share particular sequence-specific features and are thought to be evolutionarily related. Fifteen MT families have been characterised, each family being identified by its number and its taxonomic range.</p>\n\n<p>Fungi-IV (family 11) MTs are proteins of about 55-56 residues, with 9 conserved cysteines. Its members are recognised by the sequence pattern C-X-K-C-x-C-x(2)-C-K-C. The taxonomic range of the members extends to ascomycotina. The protein contains a number of unusual histidine and phenylalanine residues conserved in the N-terminal part of the sequence. This fragment does not contain any Cys. The protein binds to copper ions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02066" "Metallothionein family 11"}, "prints" {"PR00874" "MTFUNGIIV"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fungi-IV metallothionein, family 11", "short" "Metalthion_11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 17, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000869", :literature {"PUB00000300" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Kagi JH" "Schaffer A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00423a001", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Biochemistry of metallothionein.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "8509-15", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3064814}, "PUB00001490" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kagi JH" "Kojima Y."], "ISO_journal" "Experientia Suppl.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Experientia Suppl", "title" "Chemistry and biochemistry of metallothionein.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "25-61", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2959513}, "PUB00003570" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kagi JH."], "ISO_journal" "Meth.
