{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are cells of the immune system found in lymph follicles. They play a central role in the organisation of the follicular structure that supports B cell survival, affinity maturation of Ab responses, and the generation of long-lived B cell memory. Follicular dendritic cell secreted peptide (FDC-SP) is a novel secreted protein expressed by follicular dendritic cells. Its role is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may regulate immune responses [[cite:PUB00069869]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15215" "Follicular dendritic cell secreted peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Follicular dendritic cell secreted peptide", "short" "FDC-SP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 258, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 80, "sets" 0, "proteins" 80, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029187", :literature {"PUB00069869" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Marshall AJ" "Du Q" "Draves KE" "Shikishima Y" "HayGlass KT" "Clark EA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
