{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Dipeptide transport ATP-binding protein DppF found mainly in Enterobacterales species. This protein is a part of the ABC transporter DppABCDF involved in dipeptide transport and it may be responsible for energy coupling to the transport system [[cite:PUB00153702], [cite:PUB00153665]]. When a foreign outer membrane heme receptor is expressed in E.coli, DppABCDF can also transport heme and its precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), from the periplasm into the cytoplasm.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043071" "dipeptide ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit DppF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dipeptide ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit DppF", "short" "DppF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 106, "taxa" 1137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1280, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1280, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 980}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
