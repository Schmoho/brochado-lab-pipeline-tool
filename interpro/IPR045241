{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of WD40 repeat containing proteins, including Prp46 from budding yeasts, Prp5 from fission yeasts, PLRG1 from animals and PRL1/2 from plants. Prp46 and Prp5 are involved in pre-mRNA splicing and may be required for both cell cycle progression at G2/M [[cite:PUB00098347], [cite:PUB00098346]]. PLRG1 is a component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00098349], [cite:PUB00098348]]. In Arabidopsis PRL1/2 are pleiotropic regulator of glucose, stress and hormone responses [[cite:PUB00045255]].  PRL1 is part of the MAC, a multiprotein complex with a role in plant defense signaling [[cite:PUB00098350]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4yvd", "name" "Crytsal structure of human Pleiotropic Regulator 1 (PRL1)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19923" "WD40 REPEAT PROTEINPRL1/PRL2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat Prp46/PLRG1-like", "short" "Prp46/PLRG1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 57, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2620, "taxa" 9073, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5063, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5063, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3329}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045241", :literature {"PUB00098346" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["McDonald WH" "Ohi R" "Smelkova N" "Frendewey D" "Gould KL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "title" "Myb-related fission yeast cdc5p is a component of a 40S snRNP-containing complex and is essential for pre-mRNA splicing.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "5352-62", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10409726}, "PUB00098347" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Albers M" "Diment A" "Muraru M" "Russell CS" "Beggs JD."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Identification and characterization of Prp45p and Prp46p, essential pre-mRNA splicing factors.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "138-50", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12554883}, "PUB00098349" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Ajuh P" "Kuster B" "Panov K" "Zomerdijk JC" "Mann M" "Lamond AI."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Functional analysis of the human CDC5L complex and identification of its components by mass spectrometry.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "6569-81", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11101529}, "PUB00098348" {"URL" nil, "issue" "45", "authors" ["Ajuh P" "Sleeman J" "Chusainow J" "Lamond AI."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "A direct interaction between the carboxyl-terminal region of CDC5L and the WD40 domain of PLRG1 is essential for pre-mRNA splicing.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "42370-81", "volume" "276", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11544257}, "PUB00045255" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Nemeth K" "Salchert K" "Putnoky P" "Bhalerao R" "Koncz-Kalman Z" "Stankovic-Stangeland B" "Bako L" "Mathur J" "Okresz L" "Stabel S" "Geigenberger P" "Stitt M" "Redei GP" "Schell J" "Koncz C."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Pleiotropic control of glucose and hormone responses by PRL1, a nuclear WD protein, in Arabidopsis.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "3059-73", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9765207}, "PUB00098350" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Weihmann T" "Palma K" "Nitta Y" "Li X."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "Pleiotropic regulatory locus 2 exhibits unequal genetic redundancy with its homolog PRL1.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1617-26", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22813545}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000398", "name" "mRNA splicing, via spliceosome", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045241", "name" "WD repeat Prp46/PLRG1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
