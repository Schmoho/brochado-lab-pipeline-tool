This mevalonate independent pathway that utilizes pyruvate and glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate as starting materials for production of IPP occurs in a variety of bacteria, archaea and plant cells, but is absent in mammals. The isoprenoid pathway is a well known target for anti-infective drug development [[cite:PUB00043297], [cite:PUB00043298]].
