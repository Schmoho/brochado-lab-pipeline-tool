{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The cyclic N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK-C) catalyzes the phosphorylation of the Î³-COOH group of N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG) by ATP in the second step of arginine biosynthesis found in some bacteria and photosynthetic organisms using the non-acetylated, cyclic route of ornithine biosynthesis. In this pathway, glutamate is first N-acetylated and then phosphorylated by NAGK to give phosphoryl NAG, which is converted to NAG-ornithine. There are two variants of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. In the cyclic one, typified by Thermotoga maritima and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the acetyl group is recycled by reversible transacetylation from acetylornithine to glutamate. The phosphorylation of NAG by NAGK is feedback inhibited by arginine. In photosynthetic organisms, NAGK is the target of the nitrogen-signaling protein PII. Hexameric formation of NAGK domains appears to be essential to both arginine inhibition and NAGK-PII complex formation [[cite:PUB00047125], [cite:PUB00039760], [cite:PUB00091743], [cite:PUB00091744], [cite:PUB00091745], [cite:PUB00091746], [cite:PUB00075526]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7nlo", "name" "Crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ArgB in complex with L-arginine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036393", "name" "Acetylglutamate kinase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04250" "AAK_NAGK-C"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase, cyclic", "short" "NAGK-C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6018, "taxa" 22678, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22650, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22650, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17450}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
