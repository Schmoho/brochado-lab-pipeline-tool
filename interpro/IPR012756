Members of this family are designated beta'' in chloroplasts/plastids, and beta' (confusingly) in Cyanobacteria, where RpoC1 is called beta' in chloroplasts/plastids and gamma in Cyanobacteria.

In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases transcribing different sets of genes. Most RNA polymerases are multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits. The core RNA polymerase complex consists of five subunits (two alpha, one beta, one beta-prime and one omega) and is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a \"crab claw\"-like structure with an internal channel running along the full length [[cite:PUB00033173]]. The key functional sites of the enzyme, as defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, are located on the inner wall of this channel.</p>\n\n<p>RNA synthesis follows after the attachment of RNA polymerase to a specific site, the promoter, on the template DNA strand.  The RNA synthesis process continues until a termination sequence is reached. The RNA product, which is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, is known as the primary transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic nuclei contain three distinct types of RNA polymerases that differ in the RNA they synthesise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RNA polymerase I: located in the nucleoli, synthesises precursors of most ribosomal RNAs.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase II: occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises mRNA precursors.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase III: also occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises the precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, the tRNAs, and a variety of other small nuclear and cytosolic RNAs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic cells are also known to contain separate mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA polymerases.
