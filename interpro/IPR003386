{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of lipid metabolizing enzymes, including LACT and LPLA2 from humans, and PDAT from plants.</p>\n\n<p>Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LACT), also known as phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase ([ec:2.3.1.43]), is involved in extracellular metabolism of plasma lipoproteins, including cholesterol. It esterifies the free cholesterol transported in plasma lipoproteins, and is activated by apolipoprotein A-I. Its structure has been revealed [[cite:PUB00093993]]. Defects in LACT cause Fish eye disease and familial LCAT deficiency [[cite:PUB00093994]].</p>\n\n<p>Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT)([ec:2.3.1.158]) is involved in triacylglycerol formation by an acyl-CoA independent pathway. The enzyme specifically transfers acyl groups from the sn-2 position of a phospholipid to diacylglycerol, thus forming an sn-1-lysophospholipid [[cite:PUB00055421]].</p>\n\n<p>Lysosomal phospholipase A2  (LPLA2) ([ec:3.1.1.5]) plays important roles for lung surfactant metabolism and maturation of invariant natural killer T cells.
