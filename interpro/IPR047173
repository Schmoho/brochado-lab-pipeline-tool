{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of pseudokinases including human STE20-related kinase adapter protein alpha/beta (STRADA/B) and related proteins. They contain a domain with similarity to protein kinases but lacks crucial residues for catalytic activity. STRADA/B form a complex with CAB39/MO25 (CAB39/MO25alpha or CAB39L/MO25beta) which binds to and activates STK11/LKB1, being STRADA more effective than STRADB [[cite:PUB00079327]]. These proteins adopt a closed conformation typical of active protein kinases and binds STK11/LKB1 as a pseudosubstrate, promoting conformational change of STK11/LKB1 in an active conformation [[cite:PUB00089020]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48014" "SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE FRAY2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "STE20-related kinase adapter protein alpha/beta-like", "short" "STRAD_A/B-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1617, "taxa" 6230, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9062, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9062, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5699}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
