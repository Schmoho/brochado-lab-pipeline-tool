{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The sirtuin (also known as Sir2) family is broadly conserved from bacteria to human. Yeast Sir2 (silent mating-type information regulation 2),\nthe founding member, was first isolated as part of the SIR complex required for maintaining a modified chromatin structure at telomeres. Sir2 functions\nin transcriptional silencing, cell cycle progression, and chromosome stability [[cite:PUB00006020]]. Although most sirtuins in eukaryotic cells are located in the nucleus, others are cytoplasmic or mitochondrial.</p>\n\n<p>This family is divided into five classes (I-IV and U) on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of 60 sirtuins from a wide array of organisms [[cite:PUB00060761]]. Class I and class IV are further divided into three and two subgroups, respectively. The U-class sirtuins are found only in Gram-positive bacteria [[cite:PUB00060761]]. The S. cerevisiae genome encodes five sirtuins, Sir2 and four additional proteins termed 'homologues of sir two' (Hst1p-Hst4p) [[cite:PUB00006020]]. The human genome encodes seven sirtuins, with representatives from classes I-IV [[cite:PUB00060761], [cite:PUB00021065]].</p>\n\n<p>Sirtuins are responsible for a newly classified chemical reaction, NAD-dependent protein deacetylation. The final products of the reaction are the\ndeacetylated peptide and an acetyl ADP-ribose [[cite:PUB00018249]]. In nuclear sirtuins this deacetylation reaction is mainly directed against histones acetylated lysines [[cite:PUB00018250]].</p>\n\n<p>Sirtuins typically consist of two optional and highly variable N- and C-terminal domain (50-300 aa) and a conserved catalytic core domain (~250 aa). Mutagenesis experiments suggest that the N- and C-terminal regions help direct catalytic core domain to different targets [[cite:PUB00018250], [cite:PUB00005853]].</p>\n\n<p>The 3D-structure of an archaeal sirtuin in complex with NAD reveals that the protein consists of a large domain having a Rossmann fold and a small domain containing a three-stranded zinc ribbon motif. NAD is bound in a pocket between the two domains [[cite:PUB00018251]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5oj7", "name" "Sirtuin 4 orthologue from Xenopus Tropicalis in complex with ADP-ribose"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029035", "name" "DHS-like NAD/FAD-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR026591", "name" "Sirtuin, catalytic core small domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01967" "NAD-dependent protein deacetylase [cobB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sirtuin, class II", "short" "Sirtuin_class_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2025, "taxa" 7949, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5477, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5477, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4148}, "pathways" 233}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
