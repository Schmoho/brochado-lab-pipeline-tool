{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins that regularly co-occur in genomes, typically as gene pairs, with members of [ncbifam:TIGR04036], a probable FMN-dependent member of the bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) family. At least one member, RF|YP_001509627.1 from Frankia sp. EAN1pec, is fused to the LLM protein. The function of these gene pairs is unknown, but members in this entry are annotated as oxidoreductases and NADPH-dependent FMN reductases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029039", "name" "Flavoprotein-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04037" "CE1759 family FMN reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CE1759 family FMN reductase", "short" "CE1759_FMN_reduct"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1359, "taxa" 3736, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3472, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3472, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2665}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023932", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023932", "name" "CE1759 family FMN reductase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
