{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic and prokaryotic molybdoenzymes require a molybdopterin cofactor (MoCF or Moco) for their activity. The biosynthesis of this cofactor involves a complex multistep enzymatic pathway. In bacteria, The final step in MoCF synthesis is the attachment of mononuclear Mo to MPT, a process that requires MoeA and which is enhanced by MogA in an Mg2 ATP-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00034758]].</p>\n\n<p>In eukaryotes, MogA and MoeA are fused into a single polypeptide chain, such as in Drosophila protein cinnamon [[cite:PUB00001935]]. The corresponding mammalian protein gephyrin has also been implicated in the anchoring of glycinergic receptors to the cytoskeleton at inhibitory synapses [[cite:PUB00088639], [cite:PUB00007738]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fgd", "name" "Crystal structure of Gephyrin E domain in complex with Artemether"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036688", "name" "MoeA, C-terminal, domain IV superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036135", "name" "MoeA, N-terminal and linker domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10192" "MOLYBDOPTERIN BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN"}, "cdd" {"cd00887" "MoeA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdopterin biosynthesis protein MoeA-like", "short" "MoeA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 53, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9681, "taxa" 36553, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62166, "sets" 0, "proteins" 62127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 46576}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
