Their large and small subunits show little sequence similarity to other [NiFe] hydrogenases, except for key conserved residues coordinating the active site and [FeS] cluster. However, they show considerable sequence similarity to the six-subunit, energy-conserving NADH:quinone oxidoreductases (complex I), which are present in cytoplasmic membranes of many bacteria and in inner mitochondrial membranes. However, the reactions they catalyse differ significantly from complex I.
