{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase large subunit proteins from proteobacteria, including AndAc from Burkholderia cepacia and AntA from Acinetobacter baylyi. They are part of the multicomponent anthranilate dioxygenase, that converts anthranilate to catechol. Anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) is an intermediate of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and degradation [[cite:PUB00042987]]. AndAc an also act on benzoate and salicylate but not on 2-chlorobenzoate or o-toluate [[cite:PUB00093822]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041684" "anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase large subunit AndAc", "TIGR03228" "anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase, large subunit", "short" "Anthranilate_1-2-diOase_lsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 96, "taxa" 870, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 849, "sets" 0, "proteins" 849, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 677}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
