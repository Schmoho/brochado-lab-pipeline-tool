{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Squalene synthase [ec:2.5.1.21] (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase)(SQS) and phytoene synthase [ec:2.5.1.32] (PSY) share a number of functional similarities. These similarities are also reflected at the level of their primary structure [[cite:PUB00001836], [cite:PUB00003686], [cite:PUB00000230]]. In particular three well conserved regions are shared by SQS and PSY; they could be involved in substrate binding and/or the catalytic mechanism. SQS catalyses the conversion of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into squalene. It is the first committed step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The reaction carried out by SQS is catalysed in two separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of FPP to form presqualene diphosphate; this intermediate is then rearranged in a NADP-dependent reduction, to form squalene:</p>\n\n<p> <reaction> 2 FPP ->presqualene diphosphate + NADP ->squalene </reaction> </p>\n\n<p>SQS is found in eukaryotes. In yeast it is encoded by the ERG9 gene, in mammals by the FDFT1 gene. SQS seems to be membrane-bound.</p>\n\n<p>PSY catalyses the conversion of two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)into phytoene. It is the second step in the biosynthesis of carotenoids from isopentenyl diphosphate. The reaction carried out by PSY is catalysed in two separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of GGPP to form prephytoene diphosphate; this intermediate is then rearranged to form phytoene:</p>\n\n<p> <reaction> 2 GGPP ->prephytoene diphosphate ->phytoene </reaction> </p>\n\n<p>PSY is found in all organisms that synthesise carotenoids: plants and photosynthetic bacteria as well as some non-photosynthetic bacteria and fungi. In bacteria PSY is encoded by the gene crtB. In plants PSY is localised in the chloroplast.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3acx", "name" "Crystal structure of the C(30) carotenoid dehydrosqualene synthase from Staphylococcus aureus complexed with BPH-673"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008949", "name" "Isoprenoid synthase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01018" "Squalene/Phytoene Synthase Like"}, "pfam" {"PF00494" "Squalene/phytoene synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Squalene/phytoene synthase", "short" "Squ/phyt_synthse"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 72, "domain_architectures" 233, "proteomes" 8205, "taxa" 29547, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48754, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35694}, "pathways" 70}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00802", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00802"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1594", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1594"} {"accession" "GenProp1530", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1530"} {"accession" "GenProp1683", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1683"} {"accession" "GenProp0758", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0758"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
