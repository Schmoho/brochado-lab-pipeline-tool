TAF13 interacts with TAF11 and makes a histone-like heterodimer similar to H3/H4-like proteins. The dimer may be structurally and functionally similar to the spt3 protein within the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex [[cite:PUB00006419]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>TFIID is one of seven General Transcription Factors (GTF) (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIID) that are involved in accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. TFIID plays an important role in the recognition of promoter DNA and assembly of the pre-initiation complex. TFIID complex is composed of the TBP and at least 13 TAFs. Each TAF, with the help of a specific activator, is required only for expression of subset of genes and is not universally involved for transcription as are GTFs. In yeast and human cells, TAFs have been found as components of other complexes besides TFIID. Several TAFs interact via histone-fold (HFD) motifs; the HFD is the interaction motif involved in heterodimerization of the core histones and their assembly into nucleosome octamers. The minimal HFD contains three Î±-helices linked by two loops and are found in core histones, TAFs and many other transcription factors. TFIID has a histone octamer-like substructure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02269" "Transcription initiation factor IID, 18kD subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR11380" "TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION FACTOR TFIID/SUPT3-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation factor IID, subunit 13", "short" "TFIID_TAF13"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 36, "domain_architectures" 122, "proteomes" 2553, "taxa" 8551, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7652, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7634, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4870}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2054", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2054"} {"accession" "GenProp2057", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2057"} {"accession" "GenProp2053", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2053"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003195", :literature {"PUB00006419" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Birck C" "Poch O" "Romier C" "Ruff M" "Mengus G" "Lavigne AC" "Davidson I" "Moras D."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81423-3", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Human TAF(II)28 and TAF(II)18 interact through a histone fold encoded by atypical evolutionary conserved motifs also found in the SPT3 family.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "239-49", "volume" "94", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9695952}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006366", "name" "transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003195", "name" "Transcription initiation factor IID, subunit 13", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 4421}}}
