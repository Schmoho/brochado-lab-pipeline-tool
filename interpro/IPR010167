{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents amino-acid N-acetyltransferase or N-acetylglutamate synthase, which is the product of the argA gene and the first enzyme in arginine biosynthesis. This enzyme displays more diversity between bacteria, fungi and mammals than other enzymes in arginine metabolism, and N-acetylglutamate itself can have different roles in different taxonomic groups: in prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes and plants it is the first intermediate in arginine biosynthesis, while in vertebrates it is an allosteric cofactor for the first enzyme in the urea cycle [[cite:PUB00014499]]. In bacteria, arginine can regulate ornithine biosynthesis via a feedback inhibition mechanism [[cite:PUB00014891]]. This enzyme may also act on aspartate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036393", "name" "Acetylglutamate kinase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30602" "AMINO-ACID ACETYLTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01105" "Amino-acid acetyltransferase [argA]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000423" "Amino-acid N-acetyltransferase with amino acid kinase domain"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01890" "amino-acid N-acetyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amino-acid N-acetyltransferase", "short" "NH2A_AcTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2515, "taxa" 11437, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12522, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12418, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9378}, "pathways" 219}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0118", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0118"} {"accession" "GenProp1466", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1466"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
