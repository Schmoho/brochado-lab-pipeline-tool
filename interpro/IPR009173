{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of chemokine binding proteins, including C23L from Vaccinia virus. C23L inhibits host immune defense by binding to host chemokines. It binds host CC chemokines (beta chemokines) such as RANTES with high affinity, but not CXC or C chemokines (alpha and gamma chemokines). This entry also includes the truncated/inactive chemokine-binding proteins, which is presumably inactive, because the lack of signal peptide prevents the protein of being secreted [[cite:PUB00077115]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1cq3", "name" "STRUCTURE OF A SOLUBLE SECRETED CHEMOKINE INHIBITOR, VCCI, FROM COWPOX VIRUS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036540", "name" "Poxvirus chemokine inhibitor superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003696" "Chemokine binding protein, vaccinia C23L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chemokine-binding protein, viral", "short" "Chemkine-bd_vir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 49, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 116, "sets" 0, "proteins" 116, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009173", :literature {"PUB00077115" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Alcami A" "Symons JA" "Collins PD" "Williams TJ" "Smith GL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
