{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family share a patatin domain, initially discovered in potato tubers, and are known as patatin-like phospholipase domain containing proteins (PNPLA). They serve critical roles in diverse aspects of lipid metabolism and signaling. Some PNPLA1 proteins do not have the lipase consensus sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly which is essential for hydrolase activity. This entry includes PNPLA1 from Homo sapiens and Gallus gallus. It is expressed in various human tissues in low mRNA levels [[cite:PUB00081593], [cite:PUB00081594]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans PNPLA1 has a role in the formation of the epidermal lipid barrier; mutations in this gene are associated with the skin disorder known as ichthyosis [[cite:PUB00079092]]. PNPLA1 acts as an omega-hydroxyceramide transacylase involved in the synthesis of omega-O-acylceramides (esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine; EOS), which are extremely hydrophobic lipids involved in skin barrier formation  [[cite:PUB00096628], [cite:PUB00089051]]. It catalyzes the last step of the synthesis of omega-O-acylceramides by transferring linoleic acid from triglycerides to an omega-hydroxyceramid [[cite:PUB00089051]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016035", "name" "Acyl transferase/acyl hydrolase/lysophospholipase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07219" "Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Omega-hydroxyceramide transacylase PNPLA1", "short" "PNPLA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 92, "taxa" 333, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 171, "sets" 0, "proteins" 171, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 104}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
