{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family contain C2H2-type zinc fingers.  Proteins include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Protein disconnected (disco) from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), which is required for the formation of stable connections between larval optic nerve cells (also known as Bolwig's nerves) and cells in the brain [[cite:PUB00090953]].</li>\n<li>Zinc finger protein basonuclin-1 (BNC1), which has three pairs of zinc fingers and a nuclear localization signal and expression of the gene is confined to keratinocytes of stratified squamous epithelia and hair follicles. It is probably a transcriptional activator, preventing terminal differentiation of keratinocytes [[cite:PUB00090954]]. It is involved in the positive regulation of oocyte maturation through the regulation of AKT signalling cascade [[cite:PUB00100707]].</li>\n<li>Zinc finger protein basonuclin-2 (BNC2), which also has three pairs of zinc fingers and a nuclear localization signal, with the gene expressed in the ovary, testis, kidney and skin.  It is also located in the nucleus and probably a transcriptional activator, involved in the differentiation of spermatozoa and oocytes. It may also play an important role in early urinary-tract development [[cite:PUB00090955], [cite:PUB00100706]].</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15021" "DISCONNECTED-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein disconnected-like", "short" "Disconnected-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 970, "taxa" 3762, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3677, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2207}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040436", :literature {"PUB00100707" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Zhang D" "Liu Y" "Zhang Z" "Lv P" "Liu Y" "Li J" "Wu Y" "Zhang R" "Huang Y" "Xu G" "Qian Y" "Qian Y" "Chen S" "Xu C" "Shen J" "Zhu L" "Chen K" "Zhu B" "Ye X" "Mao Y" "Bo X" "Zhou C" "Wang T" "Chen D" "Yang W" "Tan Y" "Song Y" "Zhou D" "Sheng J" "Gao H" "Zhu Y" "Li M" "Wu L" "He L" "Huang H."], "ISO_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "title" "Basonuclin 1 deficiency is a cause of primary ovarian insufficiency.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "3787-3800", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30010909}, "PUB00100706" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kolvenbach CM" "Dworschak GC" "Frese S" "Japp AS" "Schuster P" "Wenzlitschke N" "Yilmaz O" "Lopes FM" "Pryalukhin A" "Schierbaum L" "van der Zanden LFM" "Kause F" "Schneider R" "Taranta-Janusz K" "Szczepanska M" "Pawlaczyk K" "Newman WG" "Beaman GM" "Stuart HM" "Cervellione RM" "Feitz WFJ" "van Rooij IALM" "Schreuder MF" "Steffens M" "Weber S" "Merz WM" "Feldkotter M" "Hoppe B" "Thiele H" "Altmuller J" "Berg C" "Kristiansen G" "Ludwig M" "Reutter H" "Woolf AS" "Hildebrandt F" "Grote P" "Zaniew M" "Odermatt B" "Hilger AC."], "ISO_journal" "Am J Hum Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Am J Hum Genet", "title" "Rare Variants in BNC2 Are Implicated in Autosomal-Dominant Congenital Lower Urinary-Tract Obstruction.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "994-1006", "volume" "104", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31051115}, "PUB00090953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Heilig JS" "Freeman M" "Laverty T" "Lee KJ" "Campos AR" "Rubin GM" "Steller H."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Isolation and characterization of the disconnected gene of Drosophila melanogaster.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "809-15", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1901262}, "PUB00090954" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Tseng H" "Green H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
