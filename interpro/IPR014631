{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CREG (cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes) is a secreted glycoprotein that inhibits cell growth in different cell types. CREG binds M6P(mannose-6-phosphate)/IGF2R(insulin-like growth factor II receptor) and mediates cell growth and is involved in cell differentiation in the nervous system. Although the CREG protein is extraordinarily well conserved throughout evolution from plants to mammals, it lacks any recognisable protein motifs or domains [[cite:PUB00027886]]. Another CREG family member, CREG2, has been identified and characterised [[cite:PUB00027933]]. CREG2 is expressed specifically in brain tissue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1xhn", "name" "The crystal structure of Cellular Repressor of E1A-stimulated Genes (CREG)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012349", "name" "FMN-binding split barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036911" "Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG)", "short" "CREG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 671, "taxa" 2496, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1351, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1342, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 951}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014631", :literature {"PUB00027886" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Di Bacco A" "Gill G."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1206670", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "The secreted glycoprotein CREG inhibits cell growth dependent on the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "5436-45", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12934103}, "PUB00027933" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kunita R" "Otomo A" "Ikeda JE."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0888-7543(02)96857-6", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Identification and characterization of novel members of the CREG family, putative secreted glycoproteins expressed specifically in brain.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "456-60", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12408961}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014631", "name" "Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG)", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
