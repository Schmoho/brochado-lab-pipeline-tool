{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein highly similar to the HisF protein, but generally represents the second HisF homologue in the genome where the other is an authentic HisF observed in the context of a complete histidine biosynthesis operon. The similarity between these WbuZ sequences and true HisFs is such that often the closest match by BLAST of a WbuZ is a HisF. Only by making a multiple sequence alignment is the homology relationship among the WbuZ sequences made apparent. WbuZ genes are invariably observed in the presence of a homologue of the HisH protein (designated WbuY) and a proposed N-acetyl sugar amidotransferase designated in WbuX in Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00045363]], IfnA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  [[cite:PUB00045364]] and PseA in Campylobacter jejuni [[cite:PUB00045365]]. Similarly, this trio of genes is invariably found in the context of saccharide biosynthesis loci.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4evz", "name" "Structure of HisF-LUCA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03572" "glycosyl amidation-associated protein WbuZ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyl amidation-associated protein, WbuZ", "short" "Glycosyl_amidation-assoc_WbuZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 79, "taxa" 816, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 384}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0794", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0794"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
