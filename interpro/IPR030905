{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A gene cluster responsible for anaerobic choline degradation has been identified within the genome of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The choline utilisation (cut) gene cluster consist of cutC and cutD.  Members of this family are CutD, a radical enzyme that serves as an activase for choline TMA-lyase, CutC. CutC is a glycyl radical enzyme related to pyruvate formate-lyase. CutD is related to pyruvate formate-lyase activase [[cite:PUB00074193]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02059" "Choline trimethylamine-lyase activating enzyme [cutD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04395" "choline TMA-lyase-activating enzyme"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Choline TMA-lyase-activating enzyme", "short" "CutC_activ_rSAM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 129, "taxa" 689, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 364}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1076", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1076"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
