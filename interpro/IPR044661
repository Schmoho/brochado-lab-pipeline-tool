{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MED15 is a component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in transcriptional activation. MED15 is part of the tail module of this complex and is involved in diverse metabolism and developmental pathways. In Arabidopsis although five paralogs have been reported, only three of them (AtMed15a, b and c) have expression data [[cite:PUB00096736]]. AtMed15a (At1g15780) is expressed in several tissues including root, leaf, flower and seeds. AtMed15a has a KIX domain at its N terminus, which interacts with different proteins such as transcription factors, single strand nucleic acid-binding proteins and splicing factors to mediate their transcriptional responses [[cite:PUB00096736]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33137" "MEDIATOR OF RNA POLYMERASE II TRANSCRIPTION SUBUNIT 15A-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 15a/b/c-like", "short" "MED15a/b/c-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 433, "taxa" 2154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3442, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3442, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1744}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044661", :literature {"PUB00096736" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kumar V" "Waseem M" "Dwivedi N" "Maji S" "Kumar A" "Thakur JK."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "title" "KIX domain of AtMed15a, a Mediator subunit of Arabidopsis, is required for its interaction with different proteins.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "e1428514", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29341856}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003713", "name" "transcription coactivator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0031490", "name" "chromatin DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044661", "name" "Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 15a/b/c-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
