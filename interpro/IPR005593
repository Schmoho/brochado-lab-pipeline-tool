{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoketolases (PK) are key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway of heterofermentative and facultative homofermentative lactic acid bacteria and of the D-fructose 6-phosphate shunt of bifidobacteria. PK activity has been sporadically reported in other microorganisms including eukaryotic yeasts. Xylulose-5-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase is a thiamine diphosphate (ThdP)-dependent enzyme found in bacteria such as Bifidobacterium sp [[cite:PUB00008466], [cite:PUB00045300]]. This enzyme has dual-specificity with the following catalytic activities:</p>\r\n\n<ul><li>[ec:4.1.2.9]:  xylose 5-P + Pi = acetyl-P + glyeraldehyde-3-P</li>\r\n<li>[ec:4.1.2.22]:  fructose-6-P + Pi = acetyl-P + erythrose-4-P</li></ul>\r\n<p>Phosphoketolases are distantly related to transketolases, e.g. [interpro:IPR005475].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ahc", "name" "Resting form of Phosphoketolase from Bifidobacterium Breve"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31273" "PHOSPHOKETOLASE-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03894" "D-xylulose 5-phosphate/D-fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017245" "Phosphoketolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Xylulose 5-phosphate/Fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase", "short" "Xul5P/Fru6P_PKetolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 43, "proteomes" 3571, "taxa" 13514, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14781, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10988}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC60002", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC60002"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
