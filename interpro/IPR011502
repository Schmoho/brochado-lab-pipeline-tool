{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of nucleoporins conserved from yeast to human.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nup85 Nucleoporin is an essential component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that seems to be required for NPC assembly and maintenance. As part of the NPC Nup107-160 subcomplex plays a role in RNA export and in tethering NUP98/Nup98 and NUP153 to the nucleus. The Nup107-160 complex seems to be required for spindle assembly during mitosis. NUP85 is required for membrane clustering of CCL2-activated CCR2. Seems to be involved in CCR2-mediated chemotaxis of monocytes and may link activated CCR2 to the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase-Rac-lammellipodium protrusion cascade [[cite:PUB00053585], [cite:PUB00053586], [cite:PUB00053587]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The Nup84 complex is composed of one copy each of Nup84, Nup85, Nup120, Nup133, Nup145C, Sec13, and Seh1.

The N terminus of Nup85 is inserted and forms a three-stranded blade that completes the Seh1 6-bladed Î²-propeller in trans.
