{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the L2 minor capsid protein, a late protein from Human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV are dsDNA viruses with no RNA stage in their replication cycle. Their dsDNA is contained within a capsid composed of 72 L1 capsomers and about 36 L2 minor capsid proteins. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after virion disassembly, and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins. L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), one at the N-terminal (nNLS) and the other at the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16  was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) [[cite:PUB00035300], [cite:PUB00035301]]. L2 capsid proteins can also interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04003" "Minor capsid protein L2 [L2]"}, "pfam" {"PF00513" "Late Protein L2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Late protein L2", "short" "Late_L2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 728, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3985, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3956, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000784", :literature {"PUB00035300" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Bordeaux J" "Forte S" "Harding E" "Darshan MS" "Klucevsek K" "Moroianu J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
