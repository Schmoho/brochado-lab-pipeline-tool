{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents transmembrane serine protease 9 (also known as polyserase-1) ([ec:3.4.21]), which belongs to MEROPS peptidase family S1A (clan PA(S)). It is encoded by the TMPRSS9 gene on chromosome 19p13 in Homo sapiens. This protein is synthesised as a membrane-associated polyprotein which undergoes post-translational cleavage to generate 3 independent serine protease chains (serase-1, serase-2 and serase-3); however it is unclear whether cleavage always takes place [[cite:PUB00044624], [cite:PUB00044625]]. The cleaved chains may remain attached to the membrane via disulphide bonds. Two of these products, serase-1 and serase-2, are proteolytically active against synthetic peptides commonly used for assaying serine proteases and their activities, and are blocked by serine protease inhibitors. However, serase-3 lacks the essential Ser residue of the catalytic triad at position 1009 and is predicted to be inactive. The domain architecture includes a type II transmembrane motif, a low-density lipoprotein receptor A domain, and three tandem trypsin-like serine protease domains [[cite:PUB00035951]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037931" "Transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS9 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane protease serine 9", "short" "Tmprss9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 45, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
