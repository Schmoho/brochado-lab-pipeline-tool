{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) protein SPT2 which is a chromatin protein involved in transcriptional regulation [[cite:PUB00017105]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These proteins shows conservation of several domains across numerous species, including having a cluster of positively charged amino acids. This cluster probably functions in the binding properties of the proteins [[cite:PUB00017105]]. Sin1p/Spt2p probably modulates the local chromatin structure by binding two strands of double-stranded DNA at their crossover point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sin1p/Spt2p has sequence similarity to HMG1 and serves as a negative transcriptional regulator of a small family of genes that are activated by the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex. It is also involved in maintaining the integrity of chromatin during transcription elongation. Sin1p/Spt2 is required for, and is directly involved in, the efficient recruitment of the mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation complex [[cite:PUB00044600]]. Spt2 is also involved in regulating levels of histone H3 over transcribed regions [[cite:PUB00044601]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08243" "SPT2 chromatin protein"}, "smart" {"SM00784" "SPT2 chromatin protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromatin SPT2", "short" "Chromatin_SPT2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 71, "proteomes" 2416, "taxa" 7988, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4267, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4262, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2740}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013256", :literature {"PUB00017105" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Novoseler M" "Hershkovits G" "Katcoff DJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
