{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a family of radical SAM/SPASM enzymes largely from the deltaproteobacteria. The family is most closely related to a radical SAM enzyme family regularly in archaea in the vicinity of tungsten-containing oxidoreductases. A single member of the family in archaea may correspond to multiple tungsten enzymes, e.g. five in Pyrococcus furiosus. Therefore, the lack of a conserved gene neighbourhood for members of this family in deltaprotebacteria suggests members may be involved in the maturation of multiple metalloenzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04311" "radical SAM/SPASM family putative metalloenzyme maturase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative radical SAM/SPASM metalloenzyme maturase", "short" "rSAM_metal_mat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 39, "taxa" 265, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 178, "sets" 0, "proteins" 178, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 151}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027586", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034391", "name" "Cmo-like SPASM domain containing protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR027586", "name" "Putative radical SAM/SPASM metalloenzyme maturase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027604", "name" "Tungsten cofactor oxidoreducase radical SAM maturase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030896", "name" "AdoMet-dependent heme synthase AhbD", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
