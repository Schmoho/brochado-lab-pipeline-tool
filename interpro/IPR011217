{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Streptogramins consist of a mixture of two components: cyclic polyunsaturated macrolactones (group A) and cyclic hexadepsipeptides (group B). The latter are cyclized through an ester bond between the hydroxyl group of an N-terminal threonine and the C-terminal carboxyl [[cite:PUB00014395]]. Inactivation of the B streptogramins (e.g., virginiamycin) can occur by linearization of the cyclic depsipeptide (lactone ring) by enzymes such as Vgb from Staphylococcus aureus [[cite:PUB00014436]].</p>\n\n<p>The molecular mechanism of streptogramin B inactivation by S. aureus Vgb and orthologues from Bordetella pertussis and Streptomyces coelicolor has been demonstrated to involve elimination rather than hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00014395]]. Vgb is a member of a large group of streptogramin B lyases that are present not only in resistant clinical isolates but also in the chromosomes of many bacteria [[cite:PUB00014395]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this group contain one or more copies of NHL repeats.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qc5", "name" "Streptogramin B lyase structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01282" "Virginiamycin B lyase [vgb]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF026412" "Streptogramin lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Streptogramin lyase", "short" "Streptogrm_lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 442, "taxa" 1879, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1590, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1586, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1178}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
