{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several glucitol operon activator (GutM) proteins. Expression of the glucitol (gut) operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by an unusual, complex system, which consists of an activator (encoded by the gutM gene) and a repressor (encoded by the gutR gene) in addition to the cAMP-CRP complex (CRP, cAMP receptor protein). Synthesis of the mRNA, which initiates at the promoter specific to the gutR gene, occurs within the gutM gene. Expressional control of the gut operon appears to occur as a consequence of the antagonistic action of the products of the autogenously regulated gutM and gutR genes [[cite:PUB00012919]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06923" "Glucitol operon activator protein (GutM)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011474" "Glucitol operon activator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucitol operon activator", "short" "Glucitol_operon_activator"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 410, "taxa" 2492, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2440, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2439, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1929}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009693", :literature {"PUB00012919" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yamada M" "Saier MH Jr."], "ISO_journal" "J.
