{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is found exclusively in epsilon-proteobacteria. Proteins in this family are approximately 180 amino acids in length. The crystal structure of HobA from Helicobacter pylori has been reported at 1.7A resolution; HobA represents a modified Rossmann fold consisting of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β1-5) flanked on one side by α2, α3 and α6 helices and α4 and α5 on the other. The α1 helix is extended away from and has minimal interaction with the globular part of the protein. Four monomers interact to form a tetrameric molecule. Four calcium atoms bind to the tetramer and these binding sites may have functional relevance. The closest structural homologue of HobA is a sugar isomerase (SIS) domain containing protein, the phosphoheptose isomerase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The SIS proteins share strong sequence homology with DiaA from Escherichia coli; yet, HobA and DiaA share no sequence homology [[cite:PUB00049482]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2uvp", "name" "Crystal structure of HobA (HP1230)from Helicobacter pylori"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038381", "name" "DNA replication regulator HobA superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12163" "DNA replication regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA replication regulator, HobA", "short" "HobA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 77, "taxa" 475, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 557, "sets" 0, "proteins" 557, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 464}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021011", :literature {"PUB00049482" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Natrajan G" "Hall DR" "Thompson AC" "Gutsche I" "Terradot L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
