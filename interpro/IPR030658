{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), also known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) or CD115 (Cluster of Differentiation 115). CSF1R is a tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as cell-surface receptor for CSF1 and IL34 and plays an essential role in the regulation of survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells, especially mononuclear phagocytes, such as macrophages and monocytes [[cite:PUB00073517]]. CSF-1 and CSF-1R play an important role in the development of the mammary gland and may be involved in the process of mammary gland carcinogenesis [[cite:PUB00073519]]. Mutations in the CSF1R gene cause hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids, which is an autosomal-dominant central nervous system white-matter disease with variable clinical presentations, including personality and behavioral changes, dementia, depression, parkinsonism, seizures and other phenotypes [[cite:PUB00073520]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes the tyrosine-protein kinase transforming protein v-fms from Feline sarcoma virus. CSF1R (the c-fms product) is its cellular counterpart. It differs in some amino acid substitutions and the replacement of 50 C-terminal amino acids by 11 unrelated residues in v-fms [[cite:PUB00073518], [cite:PUB00073716], [cite:PUB00073717]]. v-fms can bind CSF-1 and has constitutive tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity, providing growth stimulatory signals in the absence of ligand [[cite:PUB00073718]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500947" "Macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor", "short" "CSF-1_receptor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 594, "taxa" 2098, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1977, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1597, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 988}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
