{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a structurally complex cofactor, consisting of a modified tetrapyrrole with a centrally chelated cobalt. Cobalamin is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: methylcobalamin and adocobalamin. Most prokaryotes, as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes, whereas plants and fungi do not appear to use it. In bacteria and archaea, these include methionine synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, glutamate and methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, ethanolamine ammonia lyase, and diol dehydratase [[cite:PUB00015657]]. In mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [[cite:PUB00035308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents CobZ (also known as TcuA), which is essential for cobalamin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00016702], [cite:PUB00106694], [cite:PUB00106878]] and is complemented by precorrin 3B synthase CobG ([ec:1.3.99.1]). The enzyme has been shown to contain flavin, haem and Fe-S cluster cofactors, and is believed to require dioxygen as a substrate. In Rhodobacter capsulatus, CobZ is found as a N-terminal domain, whereas in other species it exists as a separate protein. The C-terminal portion is homologous to the 2-component signal transduction system protein CitB/TcuB ([interpro:IPR012830]) [[cite:PUB00106878]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02485" "FAD-dependent tricarballylate dehydrogenase TcuA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Precorrin 3B synthase CobZ", "short" "CobZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 485, "taxa" 2596, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2475, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2475, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1960}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012831", :literature {"PUB00035309" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Heldt D" "Lawrence AD" "Lindenmeyer M" "Deery E" "Heathcote P" "Rigby SE" "Warren MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
