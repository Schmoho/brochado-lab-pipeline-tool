{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA-directed RNA polymerases [ec:2.7.7.6] (also known as  DNA-dependent RNA polymerases) are responsible for the polymerisation of ribonucleotides into a sequence complementary to the template DNA. In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases transcribing different sets of genes. Most RNA polymerases are multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits. The core RNA polymerase complex consists of five subunits (two alpha, one beta, one beta-prime and one omega) and is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a \"crab claw\"-like structure with an internal channel running along the full length [[cite:PUB00033173]]. The key functional sites of the enzyme, as defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, are located on the inner wall of this channel.</p>\n\n<p>RNA synthesis follows after the attachment of RNA polymerase to a specific site, the promoter, on the template DNA strand.  The RNA synthesis process continues until a termination sequence is reached. The RNA product, which is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, is known as the primary transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic nuclei contain three distinct types of RNA polymerases that differ in the RNA they synthesise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RNA polymerase I: located in the nucleoli, synthesises precursors of most ribosomal RNAs.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase II: occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises mRNA precursors.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase III: also occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises the precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, the tRNAs, and a variety of other small nuclear and cytosolic RNAs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic cells are also known to contain separate mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA polymerases. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases, whose molecular masses vary in size from 500 to 700kDa, contain two non-identical large (>100kDa) subunits and an array of up to 12 different small (less than 50kDa) subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The phage-type enzymes are a family of single chain polymerases found in bacteriophages and mitochondria [[cite:PUB00003849], [cite:PUB00101425]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043502", "name" "DNA/RNA polymerase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037159", "name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR024075", "name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, helix hairpin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00489" "Bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase family active site signature 2", "PS00900" "Bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase family active site signature 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR10102" "DNA-DIRECTED RNA POLYMERASE, MITOCHONDRIAL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, phage-type", "short" "DNA-dir_Rpol_phage-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 44, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3126, "taxa" 11999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9454, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9051, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3444}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00410", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00410"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
