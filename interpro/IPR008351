{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MAP (Mitogen Activated Protein) kinases participate in kinase cascades, whereby at least 3 protein kinases act in series, culminating in activation of MAP kinase [[cite:PUB00011603]]. MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine residues of a conserved TXY motif.</p>\n\n<p>JNK (Jun N-terminal Kinase), also known as Stress Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK), belongs to the family of MAP kinases [[cite:PUB00008480]]. JNKs are activated by cytokines, certain ligands for GPCRs, agents that interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, and to some extent by growth factors, serum and transforming agents. Three genes have been identified in humans: JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3. Knockouts of these genes have revealed that JNK1 and/or JNK2 must have a role in both apoptosis and the immune response.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the JNK MAP kinases. In addition, it matches mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 from rice ([swissprot:Q10N20]), which is also induced in response to stress [[cite:PUB00060226]], and JNK-like MAP kinase KGB-1 from Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00075320]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01772" "JNKMAPKINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, JNK", "short" "MAPK_JNK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 103, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1031, "taxa" 4236, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62651, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7768, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4902}, "pathways" 57}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
