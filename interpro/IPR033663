{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes proteins that are required for DNA packing in viruses of the Herpesviridae family. The tripartite terminase is a complex of three subunits, (TRM1, TRM2 and TRM3) that forms in the host cytoplasm.  The complex moves to the host nucleus where it interacts with the capsid portal vertex, which forms a ring permitting genomic DNA to translocate to the viral capsule.  Subunit TRM3 (also known as UL15) is an RNase H-like nuclease that cleaves concatenated viral DNA into unit length genomes [[cite:PUB00079960]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04013" "Tripartite terminase subunit 3 [TRM3]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tripartite terminase subunit 3", "short" "HSV_TRM3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 310, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 306, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033663", :literature {"PUB00079960" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Heming JD" "Huffman JB" "Jones LM" "Homa FL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
