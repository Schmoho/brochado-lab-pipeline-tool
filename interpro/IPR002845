Biochemical assays showed that aTrm56 forms a dimer and prefers the L-shaped tRNA to the lambda form as its substrate [[cite:PUB00046137], [cite:PUB00046138]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8x6k", "name" "The X-ray structure of N-terminal catalytic domain of Thermoplasma acidophilum tRNA methyltransferase Trm56 (Ta0931)."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029026", "name" "tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR029028", "name" "Alpha/beta knot methyltransferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42197" "TRNA (CYTIDINE(56)-2'-O)-METHYLTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00077" "tRNA (cytidine(56)-2'-O)-methyltransferase"}, "pfam" {"PF01994" "tRNA ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase, aTrm56"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016123" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP016123 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase, aTrm56", "short" "tRNA_mtfrase_aTrm56"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 285, "taxa" 2091, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2705, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2704, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2296}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
