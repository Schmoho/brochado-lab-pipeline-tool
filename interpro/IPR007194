{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TRAPP plays a key role in the targeting and/or fusion of ER-to-Golgi transport vesicles with their acceptor compartment. TRAPP is a large multimeric protein that contains at least 10 subunits. This family contains many TRAPP family proteins. The Bet3 subunit is one of the better characterised TRAPP proteins and has a dimeric structure [[cite:PUB00020480]] with hydrophobic channels. The channel entrances are located on a putative membrane-interacting surface that is distinctively flat, wide and decorated with positively charged residues. Bet3 is proposed to localise TRAPP to the Golgi [[cite:PUB00020479]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bjn", "name" "X-ray Structure of human TPC6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024096", "name" "NO signalling/Golgi transport ligand-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04051" "Transport protein particle (TRAPP) component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transport protein particle (TRAPP) component", "short" "TRAPP_component"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 213, "proteomes" 2722, "taxa" 9286, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13896, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9234}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007194", :literature {"PUB00020480" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kim YG" "Sohn EJ" "Seo J" "Lee KJ" "Lee HS" "Hwang I" "Whiteway M" "Sacher M" "Oh BH."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
