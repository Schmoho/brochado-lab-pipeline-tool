{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of remarkably well-conserved proteins from gamma and beta Proteobacteria, heavily skewed towards organisms of marine environments. Its gene neighbourhood is not conserved. This family has an OsmC-like N-terminal domain. It shares a YcaO domain, frequently associated with ATP-dependent cyclodehydration for peptide modification [[cite:PUB00064880]]. The function of the family is unknown. A number of members of this family are from selenouridine-positive genomes, but this correlation may not be meaningful.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03549" "OsmC domain/YcaO domain-containing protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YcaO domain protein", "short" "YcaO_dom_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 389, "taxa" 2200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2193, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2193, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1770}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019938", :literature {"PUB00064880" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Dunbar KL" "Melby JO" "Mitchell DA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
