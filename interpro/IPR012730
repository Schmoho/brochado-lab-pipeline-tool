{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the molybdopterin biosynthesis protein MoeB in Escherichia coli and related species. MoeB and MoaD are involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, an evolutionarily conserved pathway. The MoeB enzyme covalently modifies the molybdopterin synthase MoaD by sulphurylation. The crystal structure of the complex between the E. coli MoeB and MoaD proteins reveals a MoeB(2)-MoaD(2) heterotetramer in which the MoeB subunits form a mainly hydrophobic dimer [[cite:PUB00011756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jw9", "name" "Structure of the Native MoeB-MoaD Protein Complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035985", "name" "Ubiquitin-activating enzyme", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02355" "molybdopterin-synthase adenylyltransferase MoeB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase MoeB", "short" "Mopterin_Synthase_Sase_MoeB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 241, "taxa" 1814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2094, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2094, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1556}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1711", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1711"} {"accession" "GenProp1158", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1158"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
