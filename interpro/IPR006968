{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is composed of root UVB sensitive proteins and their homologues. In Arabidopsis thaliana, proteins in this family are involved in UVB-sensing and in early seedling morphogenesis and development [[cite:PUB00072694]].</p>\n\n<p>In plants, these proteins play a role in auxin-transport, plant growth and development [[cite:PUB00057512], [cite:PUB00057513]] and appears to be expressed by all cells in the plant as well as in plastids. The family has been shown to play a role in vitamin B6 photo-protection and homoeostasis in plants [[cite:PUB00066759]].</p>\n\n<p>In line with various literature findings describing this family in plants, it was proposed that these proteins may be directly involved in the transport of one or more forms of the vitamin B6.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12770" "RUS1 FAMILY PROTEIN C16ORF58"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Root UVB sensitive family", "short" "RUS_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1959, "taxa" 7041, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7335, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7335, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4587}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006968", :literature {"PUB00072694" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Tong H" "Leasure CD" "Hou X" "Yuen G" "Briggs W" "He ZH."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
