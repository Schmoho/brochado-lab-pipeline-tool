{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are PsaM, which is subunit XII of the photosystem I reaction centre. PsaM forms part of the photosystem I complex and its binding is stabilised by PsaI [[cite:PUB00013169]]. This protein is found in both the Cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants, but is absent from non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Species that contain photosystem I also contain photosystem II, which splits water and releases molecular oxygen.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7fix", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of cyanobacterial photosystem I in the presence of ferredoxin and cytochrome c6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037279", "name" "Photosystem I PsaM, reaction centre superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00828" "Photosystem I reaction center subunit XII [psaM]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03053" "photosystem I reaction center subunit XII"}, "pfam" {"PF07465" "Photosystem I protein M (PsaM)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem I PsaM, reaction centre", "short" "PSI_PsaM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 73, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 188, "taxa" 3645, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1953, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1953, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1548}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0660", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0660"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010010", :literature {"PUB00013169" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Schluchter WM" "Shen G" "Zhao J" "Bryant DA."], "ISO_journal" "Photochem.
