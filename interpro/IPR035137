{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Dmd peptides from T4 phages. Dmd can suppress the toxicities of toxins such as LsoA (an endoribonucleases toxin expressed by E.coli). Crystal structure analysis show that Dmd is inserted into the deep groove between the N-terminal repeated domain (NRD) and the Dmd-binding domain (DBD) of LsoA. Site-directed mutagenesis of Dmd revealed the conserved residues (W31 and N40) are necessary for LsoA binding and the toxicity suppression [[cite:PUB00085215]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5i8j", "name" "Crystal structure of Dmd from phage RB69"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17587" "Discriminator of mRNA degradation"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Discriminator of mRNA degradation", "short" "Dmd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 397, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035137", :literature {"PUB00085215" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Wan H" "Otsuka Y" "Gao ZQ" "Wei Y" "Chen Z" "Masuda M" "Yonesaki T" "Zhang H" "Dong YH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
