{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) toxins are expressed by Gram-negative bacteria as part of a mechanism to inhibit the growth of neighbouring bacteria. This entry includes the inhibitor (CdiI) of the CdiA effector protein from Escherichia coli EC869 (which is a DNAse). CdiA secretion is dependent on the outer membrane protein CdiB. Upon binding to a receptor on the surface of target bacteria, the CDI toxin is delivered. The inhibitors are intracellular proteins that inactivate the toxin/effector protein  [[cite:PUB00065129], [cite:PUB00057480]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2gkp", "name" "Protein of Unknown Function NMB0488 from Neisseria meningitidis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037891", "name" "Immunity protein Cdil-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13445" "Inhibitor of the contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system of Escherichia coli EC869, and related proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF07262" "CDI immunity protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunity protein CdiI, Proteobacteria type", "short" "CdiI_Proteobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 620, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 534, "sets" 0, "proteins" 534, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 389}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009888", :literature {"PUB00065129" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Morse RP" "Nikolakakis KC" "Willett JL" "Gerrick E" "Low DA" "Hayes CS" "Goulding CW."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
