{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial and eukaryotic Aegerolysin-like proteins. Aegerolysin and ostreolysin are expressed during formation of primordia and fruiting bodies, and these haemolysins may play an important role in initial phase of fungal fruiting. The bacterial members of this family are expressed during sporulation [[cite:PUB00012335]]. Ostreolysin was found cytolytic to various erythrocytes and tumour cells [[cite:PUB00044762]]. It forms transmembrane pores 4 nm in diameter. Its activity is inhibited by total membrane lipids, and modulated by lysophosphatides.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6myi", "name" "Pleurotus ostreatus OstreolysinA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06355" "Aegerolysin"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF007951" "Hemolysin, aegerolysin type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hemolysin, aegerolysin type", "short" "Aegerolysin-typ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 318, "taxa" 1126, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 827, "sets" 0, "proteins" 820, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 560}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009413", :literature {"PUB00012335" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Berne S" "Krizaj I" "Pohleven F" "Turk T" "Macek P" "Sepcic K."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
