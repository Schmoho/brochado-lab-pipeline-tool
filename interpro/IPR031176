{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ELL/occludin family. Occludin is found in the tight junction and may play a role in the formation and regulation of the tight junction (TJ) paracellular permeability barrier [[cite:PUB00064483]]. ELL is a family of RNA polymerase II elongation factors. It is bound stably to elongation-associated factors 1 and 2, EAFs, and together these act as a strong regulator of transcription activity by direct interaction with Pol II. ELL binds to pol II on its own but the affinity is greatly increased by the cooperation of EAF [[cite:PUB00044244]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wpa", "name" "1.5 Angstrom crystal structure of human occludin fragment 413-522"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23288" "OCCLUDIN AND RNA POLYMERASE II ELONGATION FACTOR ELL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ELL/occludin family", "short" "ELL/occludin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 985, "taxa" 3993, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6985, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6985, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4530}, "pathways" 29}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031176", :literature {"PUB00064483" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Suzuki T" "Elias BC" "Seth A" "Shen L" "Turner JR" "Giorgianni F" "Desiderio D" "Guntaka R" "Rao R."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
