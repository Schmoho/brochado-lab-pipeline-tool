All GH36 enzymes cleave a terminal carbohydrate moiety from a substrate that varies considerably in size, depending on the enzyme, and may be either a starch or a glycoprotein. GH36 members are retaining enzymes that cleave their substrates via an acid/base-catalyzed, double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate [[cite:PUB00083912]]. Two aspartic acid residues have been identified as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this entry also include AgaSK, a bifunctional protein that contains two domains: one closely related to alpha-galactosidases from glycoside hydrolase family GH36 and the other containing a nucleotide-binding motif.
