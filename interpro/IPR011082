{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The CD1 family of proteins includes exosome-associated cofactor Rrp47, and DNA double-strand repair protein C1D.  Both of these proteins are implicated in DNA double-strand repair and in nuclear exosome activity.</p>\r\n<p>Rrp47 functions in nuclear RNA processing. Rrp47 is associated with nuclear exosomes, and with the nuclear exosome-specific 3'-5' exonuclease Rrp6.Rrp47 appears to be a substrate-specific nuclear cofactor that is required for the 3' processing of pre-rRNAs, snoRNAs and snRNAs (specifically U4 and U5) [[cite:PUB00014272]]. However, Rrp47 is not required for cytoplasmic exosome mRNA degradation. It also appears to have a role in DNA strand repair.</p>\r\n<p>C1D is an inducible nuclear matrix proteins that interacts with and activates the DNA-dependent protein kinase essential for DNA double-strand repair and V(D)J recombination [[cite:PUB00035574]]. C1D can interact with condensin, which is required for DNA repair and replication checkpoint control [[cite:PUB00035576]]. C1D also binds to nuclear exosomes and might regulate their functional activities, as it has RNA-binding activity [[cite:PUB00035575]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15341" "SUN-COR STEROID HORMONE RECEPTOR CO-REPRESSOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosome-associated factor Rrp47/DNA strand repair C1D", "short" "Exosome-assoc_fac/DNA_repair"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2405, "taxa" 8137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3807, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3807, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2509}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011082", :literature {"PUB00035574" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Erdemir T" "Bilican B" "Cagatay T" "Goding CR" "Yavuzer U."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
