{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Silene latifolia (White campion) and Silene dioica (Red campion) are plants with separate sexes and with X and Y sex chromosomes. The presence or absence of the Y chromosome determines which sex organs will develop. Y4 is a Y-linked gene that has a homologue on the X chromosome, X4. Both Y4 and X4 are expressed and potentially encode enzymes related to phosphoglycerate mutase and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase [[cite:PUB00027903]]. This group also includes sequences from plants that do not have separate sexes, such as Arabidopsis and other species of Silene, thus providing examples for comparison of substitution rates in the X-and Y-linked genes of plants [[cite:PUB00027980]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029033", "name" "Histidine phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036920" "Uncharacterised protein with phosphoglycerate mutase domain, plant X4/Y4 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP036920, phosphoglycerate mutase, plant X4/Y4", "short" "UCP036920_PGAM-like_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 180, "taxa" 719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 419, "sets" 0, "proteins" 405, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 262}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017070", :literature {"PUB00027903" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Atanassov I" "Delichere C" "Filatov DA" "Charlesworth D" "Negrutiu I" "Moneger F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
