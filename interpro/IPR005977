{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase, shows a high degree of conservation of structure, function, and amino acid sequence across wide phylogenetic ranges. All known Mo-nitrogenases consist of two components, component I (also called dinitrogenase, or Fe-Mo protein), an alpha2beta2 tetramer encoded by the nifD and nifK genes, and component II (dinitrogenase reductase, or Fe protein) a homodimer encoded by the nifH gene [[cite:PUB00033167], [cite:PUB00033168]] which has an Fe4S4 cluster bound between the subunits and two ATP-binding domains. The Fe protein supplies energy by ATP hydrolysis, and transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin or flavodoxin to component 1 for the reduction of molecular nitrogen to ammonia [[cite:PUB00080687], [cite:PUB00080688]]. Nitrogenase contains two unusual rare metal clusters; one of them is the iron molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), which is considered to be the site of dinitrogen reduction and whose biosynthesis requires the products of the nifNE operon and of some other nif genes [[cite:PUB00033169]]. It has been proposed that nifNE might serve as a scaffold upon which FeMo-co is built and then inserted into component I [[cite:PUB00033170]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the nitrogenase iron protein (component II), which is encoded by nifH.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7qqa", "name" "MgADP-bound Fe protein of the iron-only nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01287" "nitrogenase iron protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_00533" "Nitrogenase iron protein [nifH]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogenase iron protein NifH", "short" "Nitrogenase_Fe_NifH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 60, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 909, "taxa" 4773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4497, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4497, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3906}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
