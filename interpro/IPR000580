{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of eukaryotic proteins that are evolutionary related and involved in transcriptional regulation. These proteins are highly similar in a region of about 50 residues that include a conserved leucine-zipper domain most probably involved in homo- or hetero-dimerisation. Proteins included in this entry are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vertebrate proteins TSC22 1-4 [[cite:PUB00001471], [cite:PUB00147007]], transcriptional regulators that act in different pathways, for instance, TSC22-1 acts on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) promoter [[cite:PUB00001471]], it also promotes CASP3-mediated apoptosis [[cite:PUB00151118]] and positively regulates TGF-beta signaling [[cite:PUB00151116]]; TSC22-3 (also known as DIP) protects T-cells from IL2 deprivation-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of FOXO3A transcriptional activity that leads to the down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic factor BCL2L11 [[cite:PUB00147024]] and it also contributes to enhancement of TGF-beta signaling by binding to and modulating the transcription activator activity of SMAD4 [[cite:PUB00151117]].</li>\n<li>Drosophila protein bunched [[cite:PUB00001102]] (gene bun) (also known as shortsighted), a probable transcription factor required for peripheral nervous system morphogenesis, eye development and oogenesis.</li>\n<li>Caenorhabditis elegans protein tsct-1 (also known as T18D3.7), whose function is unknown.</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01166" "TSC-22/dip/bun family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TSC22/Bun", "short" "TSC22/Bun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 967, "taxa" 3815, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5354, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5348, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3491}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00991", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00991"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000580", :literature {"PUB00001471" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ohta S" "Shimekake Y" "Nagata K."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
