Proteins in this entry include solute carrier family 35 member F6 (SLC35F6, also known as C2orf18) from humans and PH domain-containing rcdII from Dictyostelium discoideum. SLC35F6 is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. It promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell growth [[cite:PUB00066821]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036436" "Predicted permease related to nucleotide-sugar transporters"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleotide-sugar transporter-related", "short" "UCP036436"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1546, "taxa" 5276, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2390, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2332, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1480}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012404", :literature {"PUB00066821" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kashiwaya K" "Hosokawa M" "Eguchi H" "Ohigashi H" "Ishikawa O" "Shinomura Y" "Nakamura Y" "Nakagawa H."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01058.x", "medline_journal" "Cancer Sci", "title" "Identification of C2orf18, termed ANT2BP (ANT2-binding protein), as one of the key molecules involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "457-64", "volume" "100", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19154410}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012404", "name" "Nucleotide-sugar transporter-related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
