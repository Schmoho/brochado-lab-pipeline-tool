{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of several eukaryotic BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) proteins. Members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, including TGF-beta, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins and nodals, are vital for regulating growth and differentiation. BAMBI is related to TGF-beta-family type I receptors but lacks an intracellular kinase domain [[cite:PUB00012288]].</p>\n\n<p>BAMBI is an essential regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation that represses TGF-beta and enhances Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in various cell types [[cite:PUB00077059], [cite:PUB00099037]]. Thus, it is involved in a high number of physiological and pathological processes [[cite:PUB00099038], [cite:PUB00099036], [cite:PUB00099039]]. It stably associates with TGF-beta-family receptors and inhibits BMP and activin as well as TGF-beta signalling [[cite:PUB00012288]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037456" "BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor", "short" "BAMBI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 620, "taxa" 2096, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 850, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 624}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009345", :literature {"PUB00077059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Zhang Q" "Shi XE" "Song C" "Sun S" "Yang G" "Li X."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms160817734", "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "BAMBI Promotes C2C12 Myogenic Differentiation by Enhancing Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "17734-45", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26247931}, "PUB00012288" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6752", "authors" ["Onichtchouk D" "Chen YG" "Dosch R" "Gawantka V" "Delius H" "Massague J" "Niehrs C."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/46794", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Silencing of TGF-beta signalling by the pseudoreceptor BAMBI.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "480-5", "volume" "401", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10519551}, "PUB00099036" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Yang X" "Ning Y" "Mei C" "Zhang W" "Sun J" "Wang S" "Zan L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Rep", "title" "The role of BAMBI in regulating adipogenesis and myogenesis and the association between its polymorphisms and growth traits in cattle.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "5963-5974", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32740798}, "PUB00099037" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhao HJ" "Chang HM" "Klausen C" "Zhu H" "Li Y" "Leung PCK."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Signal", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Signal", "title" "Bone morphogenetic protein 2 induces the activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling and human trophoblast invasion through up-regulating BAMBI.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "109489", "volume" "67", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31786181}, "PUB00099038" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yao X" "Yu T" "Xi F" "Xu Y" "Ma L" "Pan X" "Chen S" "Han M" "Yin Y" "Dai X" "Xu G" "Zhang H" "Yang G" "Xie L."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "BAMBI shuttling between cytosol and membrane is required for skeletal muscle development and regeneration.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "125-132", "volume" "509", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30580997}, "PUB00099039" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lai H" "Chen A" "Cai H" "Fu J" "Salem F" "Li Y" "He JC" "Schlondorff D" "Lee K."], "ISO_journal" "Kidney Int", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Kidney Int", "title" "Podocyte and endothelial-specific elimination of BAMBI identifies differential transforming growth factor-β pathways contributing to diabetic glomerulopathy.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "601-614", "volume" "98", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32739209}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030512", "name" "negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0090263", "name" "positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009345", "name" "BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
