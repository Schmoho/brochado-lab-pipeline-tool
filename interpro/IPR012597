{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family corresponds to mating-type pheromone proteins. The homobasidiomycetes, or mushroom fungi, have arguably the most complex mating system of all known organisms. Many species possess a mating system known as bifactorial incompatibility, where two unlinked loci control the mating-type of an individual incompatibility loci (the A and B mating-type loci). Each A mating-type sublocus encodes a pair of divergently transcribed homeodomain transcription factors while the genes responsible for B mating-type activity encode lipopeptide pheromones and G-protein -coupled pheromone receptors [[cite:PUB00016395]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08015" "Fungal mating-type pheromone"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fungal mating-type pheromone", "short" "Pheromone"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 63, "taxa" 233, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 226, "sets" 0, "proteins" 225, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 183}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012597", :literature {"PUB00016395" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["James TY" "Liou SR" "Vilgalys R."], "ISO_journal" "Fungal Genet.
