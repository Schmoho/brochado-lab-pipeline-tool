{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Hpn protein found in different strains of Helicobacter pylori  [[cite:PUB00105257]]. Hpn is a histidine-rich polypeptide, 60 amino acids in length, capable of binding nickel and several other metals. It can store a reserve of nickel for biosynthesis of active urease, critical to the ability of the bacterium to survive acid exposure during colonisation, and hydrogenase [[cite:PUB00105258], [cite:PUB00105260]]. Hpn is closely related in its N-terminal region to a somewhat longer His and Gln-rich protein, called the Hpn-like protein. Both are expressed, under control of NikR, in response to nickel.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033705" "nickel storage protein Hpn"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nickel storage protein Hpn", "short" "Hpn-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 14, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049950", :literature {"PUB00105258" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Benoit SL" "Miller EF" "Maier RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "Helicobacter pylori stores nickel to aid its host colonization.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "580-4", "volume" "81", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23230291}, "PUB00105257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Seshadri S" "Benoit SL" "Maier RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Roles of His-rich hpn and hpn-like proteins in Helicobacter pylori nickel physiology.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "4120-6", "volume" "189", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17384182}, "PUB00105260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Saylor Z" "Maier R."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Helicobacter pylori nickel storage proteins: recognition and modulation of diverse metabolic targets.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1059-1068", "volume" "164", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29906255}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049950", "name" "Nickel storage protein Hpn", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
