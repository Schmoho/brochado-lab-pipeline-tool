{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the rpoE leader peptide from Escherichia coli (RseD) and similar proteins from enterobacterales. RseD is a short protein whose stop codon overlaps with the start codon of downstream rpoE, the gene for the extracytoplasmic stress response sigma factor RpoE. A premature stop codon at position 12 results in decreased expression of RpoE, thus they are translationally coupled [[cite:PUB00105252]]. It participates in the CrsA-mediated fine-tuning of the stress response. The corresponding locus in Klebsiella pneumoniae appears to be split into an upstream and a downstream peptide.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033697" "rpoE leader peptide RseD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RpoE leader peptide", "short" "RseD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 320, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 319, "sets" 0, "proteins" 319, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 240}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049933", :literature {"PUB00105252" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Yakhnin H" "Aichele R" "Ades SE" "Romeo T" "Babitzke P."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Circuitry Linking the Global Csr- and ÏƒE-Dependent Cell Envelope Stress Response Systems.
