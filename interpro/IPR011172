{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytokines can be grouped into a family on the basis of sequence, functional and structural similarities [[cite:PUB00002042], [cite:PUB00004130], [cite:PUB00015257]]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (also known as TNF-alpha or cachectin) is a monocyte-derived cytotoxin that has been implicated in tumour regression, septic shock and cachexia [[cite:PUB00006091], [cite:PUB00006095]]. The protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine [[cite:PUB00006101]]. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00006098]]. Both the mature protein and a partially-processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide [[cite:PUB00006098]].</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of different families of TNF, but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that are recognised by their specific receptors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>TNF exerts its function mainly through two TNF receptors, TNF-1 and TNF-2, which are expressed on nearly all cells of the body.
