{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of bacteria obtain nitrogen from urea by means of a biotin-and ATP-dependent urea degradation system distinct from the urease enzyme. The two characterised proteins of this system are the enzymes urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase, but other, uncharacterised proteins are encoded nearby in multiple organisms. This entry includes predicted permeases of the amino acid permease family, likely to transport either urea or a compound from which urea is derived. It is found so far only Actinobacteria, whereas a number of other species with the urea carboxylase have an adjacent ABC transporter operon.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03428" "permease, urea carboxylase system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urea carboxylase-associated, permease", "short" "Urea_CO2ase-assoc_permease"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 95, "taxa" 414, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 371, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017794", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002293", "name" "Amino acid/polyamine transporter I", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004754", "name" "Amino acid antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR022461", "name" "Arginine/ornithine antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR004755", "name" "Cationic amino acid transport permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004756", "name" "Amino acid permease subfamily", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004757", "name" "Ethanolamine permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004758", "name" "Amino acid transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004759", "name" "Glutamate:g-aminobutyrate antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004760", "name" "L-type amino acid transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017794", "name" "Urea carboxylase-associated, permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022520", "name" "Putative glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027562", "name" "Histidine-histamine antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027566", "name" "Putrescine transporter PotE", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044566", "name" "Polyamine transporter RMV1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
