{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the conjugative transfer signal peptidase (TraF), which belongs to MEROPS peptidase family S26, subfamily S26C (TraF signal peptidase, clan SF). It is found in operons that encode elements of conjugative transfer systems. This family is homologous to a broader family of signal (leader) peptidases such as LepB. This family is present in both Ti-type and I-type conjugative systems [[cite:PUB00034405]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036286", "name" "LexA/Signal peptidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02771" "conjugative transfer signal peptidase TraF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S26C, conjugative transfer signal peptidase TraF", "short" "Peptidase_S26C_TraF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 199, "taxa" 1470, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1258, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1258, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1025}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0490", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0490"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014139", :literature {"PUB00034405" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Waters VL" "Strack B" "Pansegrau W" "Lanka E" "Guiney DG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
