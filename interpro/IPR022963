{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Galactokinase catalyses the first reaction in the galactose metabolism pathway, the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of galactose, yielding galactose-1-phosphate [[cite:PUB00003653], [cite:PUB00004765]]. Deficiency in this enzyme results in the disease galactosemia, which is responsible for the formation of cataracts in newborn babies, and is possibly responsible for presenile cataracts in adults [[cite:PUB00004765]]. In yeast, the GAL3 gene product is required for the GAL4-mediated induction of other enzymes involved in galactose metabolism. The induction of GAL1 production then reinforces this process, increasing the expression of other galactose-inducible genes. GAL3 has been shown to be similar to the GAL1 protein [[cite:PUB00003653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents bacterial-type galactokinases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2cz9", "name" "Crystal Structure of galactokinase from Pyrococcus horikoshi"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014721", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5 domain 2-type fold, subgroup", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00246" "Galactokinase [galK]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galactokinase, bacterial", "short" "Galactokinase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2167, "taxa" 8899, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9162, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9162, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6976}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
