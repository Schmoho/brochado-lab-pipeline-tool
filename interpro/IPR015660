{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Basic helix-loop-helix proteins (bHLH) are a group of eukaryotic transcription factors that exert a determinative influence in a variety of developmental pathways. These transcription factors are characterised by a highly evolutionary conserved bHLH domain that mediates specific dimerisation [[cite:PUB00004974]]. They facilitate the conversion of inactive monomers to trans-activating dimers at appropriate stages of development [[cite:PUB00000717]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this entry include MASH1/Ascl1a and related proteins from plants, worms, insects and mammals. MASH1/Ascl1a is a regulator of axonal growth across vertebrates and can induce modifications to the intrinsic state of neurons to promote functional regeneration in response to CNS injury [[cite:PUB00085019], [cite:PUB00085017]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13935" "ACHAETE-SCUTE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Achaete-scute transcription factor-related", "short" "MASH1/Ascl1a-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 971, "taxa" 5743, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7570, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4155}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015660", :literature {"PUB00000717" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Garrell J" "Campuzano S."], "ISO_journal" "Bioessays", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.950131002", "medline_journal" "Bioessays", "title" "The helix-loop-helix domain: a common motif for bristles, muscles and sex.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "493-8", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1755826}, "PUB00085019" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gao L" "Zhu X" "Chen G" "Ma X" "Zhang Y" "Khand AA" "Shi H" "Gu F" "Lin H" "Chen Y" "Zhang H" "He L" "Tao Q."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.126292", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "A novel role for Ascl1 in the regulation of mesendoderm formation via HDAC-dependent antagonism of VegT.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "492-503", "volume" "143", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26700681}, "PUB00085017" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Williams RR" "Venkatesh I" "Pearse DD" "Udvadia AJ" "Bunge MB."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118918", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "MASH1/Ascl1a leads to GAP43 expression and axon regeneration in the adult CNS.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e0118918", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25751153}, "PUB00004974" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Littlewood TD" "Evan GI."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Profile", "title" "Transcription factors 2: helix-loop-helix.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "621-702", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7553065}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006357", "name" "regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015660", "name" "Achaete-scute transcription factor-related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
