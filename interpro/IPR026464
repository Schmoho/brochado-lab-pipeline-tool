However, NosDFY-like complexes appear to occur also in species whose copper requiring enzymes are something other than nitrous-oxide reductase [[cite:PUB00060489]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011050", "name" "Pectin lyase fold/virulence factor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04247" "nitrous oxide reductase family maturation protein NosD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrous oxide reductase family maturation protein NosD", "short" "NosD_copper_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1014, "taxa" 4629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4403, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4403, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3243}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026464", :literature {"PUB00060489" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wunsch P" "Herb M" "Wieland H" "Schiek UM" "Zumft WG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
