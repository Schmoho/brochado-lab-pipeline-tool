{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the putative surface-exposed virulence protein BigA from Salmonella typhimurium ([swissprot:P25927]) and related Salmonella species. BigA is an autotransporter, meaning is has a C-terminal outer membrane -barrel ([interpro:IPR005546]), through which passenger regions of the proteins are transported. The N terminus of the proteins of this family contain the variable passenger domain that is translocated across the membrane. Once the passenger domain is exported it is cleaved auto-catalytically in some proteins, in others a different protease is used and in some cases no cleavage occurs [[cite:PUB00008435]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033178" "autotransporter adhesin BigA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Virulence protein BigA-like", "short" "BigA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 109, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1422, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1422, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049865", :literature {"PUB00008435" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Henderson IR" "Navarro-Garcia F" "Nataro JP."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Microbiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0966-842X(98)01318-3", "medline_journal" "Trends Microbiol", "title" "The great escape: structure and function of the autotransporter proteins.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "370-8", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9778731}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049865", "name" "Virulence protein BigA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
