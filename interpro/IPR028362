{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alginate biosynthesis protein AlgI is a probable poly(beta-D-mannuronate) O-acetylase. Together with AlgJ and AlgF, it forms an inner membrane complex which probably interacts with the alginate polymerisation-transport complex and adds acetyl groups at the O-2 and O-3 positions of polymannuronic acid. Acetylation of alginate is important for the architecture of biofilms [[cite:PUB00068170]]. Alginate is also a major microbial factor in resistance to immune effectors [[cite:PUB00068171]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500217" "Alginate O-acetyltransferase AlgI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alginate O-acetyltransferase AlgI", "short" "AlgI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2988, "taxa" 13374, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24571, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23950, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17656}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
