{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several latent membrane protein 1 or LMP1s mostly from Epstein-Barr virus (strain GD1) (HHV-4) (Human herpesvirus 4). LMP1 of HHV-4 is a 62-65kDa plasma membrane protein possessing six membrane spanning regions, a short cytoplasmic N terminus and a long cytoplasmic carboxy tail of 200 amino acids. HHV-4 virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is essential for HHV-4 mediated transformation and has been associated with several cases of malignancies. HHV-4-like viruses in Macaca fascicularis (Cynomolgus monkeys) have been associated with high lymphoma rates in immunosuppressed monkeys [[cite:PUB00010472]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05297" "Herpesvirus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus latent membrane 1", "short" "Herpes_LMP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1753, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1721, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007961", :literature {"PUB00010472" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Faucher S" "Dimock K" "Wright KE."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1702(02)00144-2", "medline_journal" "Virus Res", "title" "Characterization of the Cyno-EBV LMP1 homologue and comparison with LMP1s of EBV and other EBV-like viruses.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "63-75", "volume" "90", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12457963}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019087", "name" "symbiont-mediated transformation of host cell", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007961", "name" "Herpesvirus latent membrane 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 10}}}
