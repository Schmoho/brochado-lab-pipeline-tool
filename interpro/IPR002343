{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many eukaryotic proteins that are either known or thought to bind single-stranded RNA contain one or more copies of a putative RNA-binding domain of about 90 amino acids [[cite:PUB00001891], [cite:PUB00005341]]. This region has been found in, for example, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, pre-RNA and mRNA associated proteins, Drosophila sex determination and elav proteins, human paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen HuD, and many others. The structure of an RNA-binding domain of Drosophila Sex-lethal (Sxl) protein has been determined using multi-dimensional hetero-nuclear NMR [[cite:PUB00000396]]. Sxl contains two RNP consensus-type RNA-binding domains (RBDs) - the determined structure represents the second of these (RBD-2) [[cite:PUB00000396]]. The calculated intermediate-resolution family of structures exhibits the β-α-β/β-α-β tertiary fold found in other RBD-containing proteins [[cite:PUB00000396]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fxl", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF HUD AND AU-RICH ELEMENT OF THE C-FOS RNA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035979", "name" "RNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012677", "name" "Nucleotide-binding alpha-beta plait domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00961" "HUDSXLRNA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen", "short" "Hud_Sxl_RNA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1459, "taxa" 6138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 87958, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12112}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002343", :literature {"PUB00000396" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Lee AL" "Kanaar R" "Rio DC" "Wemmer DE."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00250a031", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Resonance assignments and solution structure of the second RNA-binding domain of sex-lethal determined by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "13775-86", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7524663}, "PUB00001891" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bandziulis RJ" "Swanson MS" "Dreyfuss G."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/abstract/3/4/431", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "RNA-binding proteins as developmental regulators.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "431-7", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2470643}, "PUB00005341" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Dreyfuss G" "Swanson MS" "Pinol-Roma S."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
