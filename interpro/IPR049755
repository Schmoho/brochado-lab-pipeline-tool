{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the uncharacterised HTH-type transcriptional regulator YafC found in Escherichia coli ([swissprot:P30864]) [[cite:PUB00106047]] and related proteins, such as the Neisseria meningitidis CrgA protein ([swissprot:Q9JXW7]). CrgA is a regulatory protein that activates transcription of the NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase MdaB and represses its own transcription [[cite:PUB00117985]]. This protein is involved in the regulation of bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells and may play a central regulatory role in meningococcal adhesion, particularly in switching from initial adhesion to intimate adhesion by downregulating the bacterial surface structures that hinder this adhesion [[cite:PUB00153125], [cite:PUB00153126]]. CrgA is directly responsible for transcriptional repression through specific base contacts, probably in the major DNA groove, resulting in DNA looping. Upon contact with target cells, CrgA is released from the DNA, allowing transcription of the target gene to proceed to elongation and facilitating tight control of the expression of genes regulated by CrgA [cite:PUB00153127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040888" "DNA-binding transcriptional regulator YafC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding transcriptional regulators YafC/CrgA", "short" "YafC/CrgA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 916, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1220, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1220, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 940}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049755", :literature {"PUB00153125" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Deghmane AE" "Petit S" "Topilko A" "Pereira Y" "Giorgini D" "Larribe M" "Taha MK."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/emboj/19.5.1068", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Intimate adhesion of Neisseria meningitidis to human epithelial cells is under the control of the crgA gene, a novel LysR-type transcriptional regulator.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1068-78", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10698947}, "PUB00153127" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Deghmane AE" "Giorgini D" "Maigre L" "Taha MK."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04167.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Analysis in vitro and in vivo of the transcriptional regulator CrgA of Neisseria meningitidis upon contact with target cells.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "917-27", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15255902}, "PUB00153126" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Deghmane AE" "Giorgini D" "Larribe M" "Alonso JM" "Taha MK."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02838.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Down-regulation of pili and capsule of Neisseria meningitidis upon contact with epithelial cells is mediated by CrgA regulatory protein.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1555-64", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11952904}, "PUB00106047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Gao Y" "Yurkovich JT" "Seo SW" "Kabimoldayev I" "Drager A" "Chen K" "Sastry AV" "Fang X" "Mih N" "Yang L" "Eichner J" "Cho BK" "Kim D" "Palsson BO."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Systematic discovery of uncharacterized transcription factors in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "10682-10696", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30137486}, "PUB00117985" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Ieva R" "Alaimo C" "Delany I" "Spohn G" "Rappuoli R" "Scarlato V."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "CrgA is an inducible LysR-type regulator of Neisseria meningitidis, acting both as a repressor and as an activator of gene transcription.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3421-30", "volume" "187", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15866928}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049755", "name" "DNA-binding transcriptional regulators YafC/CrgA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
