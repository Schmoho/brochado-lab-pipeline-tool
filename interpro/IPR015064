{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein group contain two antiparallel Î± helices that are linked by a highly structured inter-helix loop to form a helical hairpin; the structure is stabilised by numerous hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. These sporulation inhibitors are antikinases that bind to the histidine kinase KinA phosphotransfer domain and act as a molecular barricade that inhibit productive interaction between the ATP binding site and the phosphorylatable KinA His residue. This results in the inhibition of sporulation (by preventing phosphorylation of spo0A) [[cite:PUB00029984]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3fyr", "name" "Crystal structure of the sporulation histidine kinase inhibitor Sda from Bacillus subtilis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036916", "name" "Sporulation inhibitor A superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08970" "Sporulation inhibitor A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation inhibitor A", "short" "Sda"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 449, "taxa" 1267, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1820, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1820, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1428}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015064", :literature {"PUB00029984" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Rowland SL" "Burkholder WF" "Cunningham KA" "Maciejewski MW" "Grossman AD" "King GF."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
