{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Escherichia coli, Haemophilus spp and Campylobacter spp. all produce a toxin that is seen to cause distension in certain cell lines [[cite:PUB00006646], [cite:PUB00006675]], which eventually disintegrate and die. This novel toxin, termed cytolethal distending toxin (cdt), has three subunits: A, B and C. Their sizes are approx. 27.7, 29.5 and 19.9kDa respectively [[cite:PUB00006646]], and they appear to be entirely novel [[cite:PUB00006675]].<p>Further research on the complete toxin has revealed that it blocks the cell cycle at stage G2, through inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1, and without induction of DNA breaks. This leads to multipolar abortive mitosis and micronucleation, associated with centrosomal amplification [[cite:PUB00006618]]. The roles of each subunit are unclear, but it is believed that they have separate roles in pathogenicity.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the A and C subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sr4", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal distending toxin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035992", "name" "Ricin B-like lectins", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03498" "Cytolethal distending toxin A/C domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytolethal distending toxin A/C", "short" "CDtoxinA/C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 514, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 789, "sets" 0, "proteins" 789, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 675}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003558", :literature {"PUB00006646" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Pickett CL" "Cottle DL" "Pesci EC" "Bikah G."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
