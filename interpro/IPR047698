{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ArsF from Shewanella putrefaciens ([swissprot:E6XPK1]) and similar prokaryotic sequences. ArsF acts together with ArsE as a nitroreductase for trivalent forms (having As(III) instead of As(V)) of two synthetic aromatic organoarsenical biocides, nitarsone and roxarsone, reducing the nitro group to an amine, after which efflux confers resistance to the arsenical [[cite:PUB00105794]]. Because the nitro group is rather far from the As(III) moiety of the known substrates, it is likely that conversed properties of members of this family include nitroreductase activity but not arsenical resistance activity.</p>\n\n<p>Members of this family are likely to adopt Thioredoxin-like fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040494" "nitrophenyl compound nitroreductase subunit ArsF family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitroreductase subunit ArsF-like", "short" "ArsF-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 165, "taxa" 1412, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1431, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1430, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1108}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047698", :literature {"PUB00105794" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Chen J" "Zhang J" "Rosen BP."], "ISO_journal" "Environ Sci Technol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Environ Sci Technol", "title" "Role of ArsEFG in Roxarsone and Nitarsone Detoxification and Resistance.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "6182-6191", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31059239}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047698", "name" "Nitroreductase subunit ArsF-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
