{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Initiation of eukaryotic mRNA transcription requires melting of promoter DNA with the help of the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH. In higher eukaryotes, the general transcription factor TFIIE consists of two subunits: the large alpha subunit ([interpro:IPR002853]) and the small beta ([interpro:IPR003166]). TFIIE beta has been found to bind to the region where the promoter starts to open to be single-stranded upon transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The approximately 120-residue central core domain of TFIIE beta plays a role in double-stranded DNA binding of TFIIE [[cite:PUB00006521]].</p>\n\n<p>The TFIIE β-central core DNA-binding domain consists of three helices with a β-hairpin at the C terminus, resembling the winged helix proteins. It shows a novel double-stranded DNA-binding activity where the DNA-binding surface locates on the opposite side to the previously reported winged helix motif by forming a positively charged furrow [[cite:PUB00006521]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents a transcription initiation factor TFIIE, beta subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016398" "Transcription initiation factor IIE, beta subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR12716" "TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION FACTOR IIE, BETA SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation factor TFIIE, beta subunit", "short" "TFIIE-bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 70, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2537, "taxa" 10352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5117, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5082, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2844}, "pathways" 33}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016656", :literature {"PUB00006521" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Okuda M" "Watanabe Y" "Okamura H" "Hanaoka F" "Ohkuma Y" "Nishimura Y."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/19.6.1346", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Structure of the central core domain of TFIIEbeta with a novel double-stranded DNA-binding surface.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1346-56", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10716934}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006367", "name" "transcription initiation at RNA polymerase II promoter", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005673", "name" "transcription factor TFIIE complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016656", "name" "Transcription initiation factor TFIIE, beta subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
