{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This subfamily falls within the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. The Class II subfamilies are characterised by a domain that is located between the second and third conserved catalytic motifs of the superfamily domain. The IIB subfamily is distinguished from the IIA subfamily ([interpro:IPR006357]) by homology and the predicted secondary structure of this domain by PSI-PRED. The IIB subfamilys Class II domain has the following predicted structure: Helix-Sheet-Sheet-(Helix or Sheet)-Helix-Sheet-(variable)-Helix-Sheet-Sheet. The IIB subfamily consists of trehalose-6-phosphatase, plant and cyanobacterial sucrose-phosphatase and a closely related group of bacterial and archaeal sequences, eukaryotic phosphomannomutase, a large subfamily of Cof-like hydrolases, containing many closely related bacterial sequences, a hypothetical equivalog containing the Escherichia coli YedP protein, as well as two other small clusters whose relationship to the other groups is unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7xhz", "name" "Crystal structure of SAV2152 from MRSA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043169", "name" "Phosphomannomutase, cap domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01484" "HAD-IIB family hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD-superfamily hydrolase, subfamily IIB", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IIB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 88, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10360, "taxa" 40137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 113147, "sets" 0, "proteins" 112545, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83941}, "pathways" 105}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1407", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1407"} {"accession" "GenProp1306", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1306"} {"accession" "GenProp1534", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1534"} {"accession" "GenProp1734", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1734"} {"accession" "GenProp1344", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1344"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
