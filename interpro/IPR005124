{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the eukaryotic vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) G subunit. V-ATPases generate an acidic environment in several intracellular compartments. Correspondingly, they are found as membrane-attached proteins in several organelles. They are also found in the plasma membranes of some specialised cells. V-ATPases consist of peripheral (V1) and membrane integral (V0) heteromultimeric complexes. The G subunit is part of the V1 subunit, but is also thought to be strongly attached to the V0 complex. It may be involved in the coupling of ATP degradation to H+ translocation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12713" "VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE SUBUNIT G"}, "pfam" {"PF03179" "Vacuolar (H+)-ATPase G subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01147" "V-type ATPase subunit G"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar (H+)-ATPase G subunit", "short" "V-ATPase_G"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 71, "domain_architectures" 94, "proteomes" 2588, "taxa" 9101, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6192, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6168, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4136}, "pathways" 48}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005124", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046961", "name" "proton-transporting ATPase activity, rotational mechanism", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:1902600", "name" "proton transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016471", "name" "vacuolar proton-transporting V-type ATPase complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005124", "name" "Vacuolar (H+)-ATPase G subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 25, "alignment:full" 3762}}}
