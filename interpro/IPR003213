{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:7.1.1.9]) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex that is a component of the respiratory chain complex and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen [[cite:PUB00000581]]. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane.</p>\n\n<p>In eukaryotes, in addition to the three large subunits, I, II and III, that form the catalytic centre of the enzyme complex, there are a variable number of small polypeptide subunits. One of these subunits is the potentially haem-binding subunit, VIb, which is encoded in the nucleus [[cite:PUB00014035]].  Subunit VIb is one of three mammalian subunits that lacks a transmembrane region. It is located on the cytosolic side of the membrane and helps form the dimer interface with the corresponding subunit on the other monomer complex [[cite:PUB00081734], [cite:PUB00081733]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7coh", "name" "Dimeric Form of Bovine Heart Cytochrome c Oxidase in the Fully Oxidized State"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036549", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B/Cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46281" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT 6B", "PTHR11387" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT 6B"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000278" "Cytochrome-c oxidase, subunit VIb"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIb", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_su6B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 113, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2150, "taxa" 7474, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4972, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4963, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3158}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1426", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1426"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003213", :literature {"PUB00000581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Capaldi RA" "Malatesta F" "Darley-Usmar VM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
