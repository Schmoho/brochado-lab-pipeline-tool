{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribosome biogenesis protein C1orf109 is involved in the cytoplasmic maturation steps of pre-60S ribosomal particles by promoting the release of shuttling protein RSL24D1/RLP24 from the pre-ribosomal particles [[cite:PUB00101098]].  It has been first identified as the downstream target of a protein kinase, casein kinase 2 (CK2) which is upregulated in cancer cells.  C1orf109 has been found upregulated in cancer cells and therefore, it has been suggested to be important in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation. The precise mechanism of CK2 targeting C1orf109 is not well characterised. It is found to be localised in the nucleus and cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00069830]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16234" "SIMILAR TO HYPOTHETICAL PROTEIN FLJ20508"}, "pfam" {"PF15011" "Ribosome biogenesis protein C1orf109-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome biogenesis protein C1orf109-like", "short" "CA109-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 45, "proteomes" 748, "taxa" 3252, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1569, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 965}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029159", :literature {"PUB00069830" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Liu SS" "Zheng HX" "Jiang HD" "He J" "Yu Y" "Qu YP" "Yue L" "Zhang Y" "Li Y."], "ISO_journal" "J.
