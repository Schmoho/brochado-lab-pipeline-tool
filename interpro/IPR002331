{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Triglyceride lipases ([ec:3.1.1.3]) are lipolytic enzymes that hydrolyse ester linkages of triglycerides [[cite:PUB00000684]]. Lipases are widely distributed in animals, plants and prokaryotes. At least three tissue-specific isozymes exist in higher vertebrates: pancreatic, hepatic and gastric/lingual. These lipases are closely related to each other and to lipoprotein lipase ([ec:3.1.1.34]), which hydrolyses triglycerides of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) [[cite:PUB00001369]]. Pancreatic lipase (triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, [ec:3.1.1.3]) plays a key role in dietary fat absorption by hydrolysing dietary long chain triacyl-glycerol to free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols in the intestinal lumen [[cite:PUB00002523]]. The activity of lipase is stimulated by colipase in the presence of bile acids.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structure of human pancreatic lipase has been determined by X-ray crystallography [[cite:PUB00004055]]. The enzyme is a single-chain glycoprotein of 449 amino acids. Structural results suggest that Ser 152 is the nucleophilic residue essential for catalysis [[cite:PUB00004055]]. The residue is located in the N-terminal domain at the C-terminal edge of a doubly-wound parallel Î²-sheet, and forms part of an Asp-His-Ser triad that is chemically analogous to, but structurally different from, that of the serine proteases [[cite:PUB00004055]]. The putative hydrolytic site is covered by a surface loop, and is thus inaccessible to solvent. It is thought that interfacial activation may involve a reorientation of this flap, not only in pancreatic lipases but also in the related hepatic and lipoprotein lipases [[cite:PUB00004055]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00823" "PANCLIPASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pancreatic lipase", "short" "Lipase_panc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 597, "taxa" 2807, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15927, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2859, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1568}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
