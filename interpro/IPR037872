{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Rab3 subfamily contains Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab3C, and Rab3D. All four isoforms were found in mouse brain and endocrine tissues, with varying levels of expression. Rab3A, Rab3B, and Rab3C localized to synaptic and secretory vesicles; Rab3D was expressed at high levels only in adipose tissue, exocrine glands, and the endocrine pituitary, where it is localized to cytoplasmic secretory granules [[cite:PUB00087749]]. Rab3 appears to control Ca2+-regulated exocytosis. The appropriate GDP/GTP exchange cycle of Rab3A is required for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis to occur, and interaction of the GTP-bound form of Rab3A with effector molecule(s) is widely believed to be essential for this process [[cite:PUB00034797]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rab", "name" "GPPNHP-BOUND RAB3A AT 2.0 A RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01865" "Rab GTPase family 3 contains Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab3C and Rab3D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab3", "short" "Rab3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 869, "taxa" 3484, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2944, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2944, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1940}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037872", :literature {"PUB00087749" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Millar AL" "Pavios NJ" "Xu J" "Zheng MH."], "ISO_journal" "Histol.
