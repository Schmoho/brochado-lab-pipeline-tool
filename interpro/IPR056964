{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of putative holin proteins found in various phages infecting actinobacterial hosts, particularly Gordonia, Mycobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Microbacterium. Holins are small membrane proteins involved in the timing of host cell lysis during bacteriophage infection. Members of this family typically range from 94 to 151 amino acids in length and contain 3 to 4 predicted transmembrane helices. While some members have an N-terminal signal peptide or lipoprotein signal, most do not. It is unclear where the annotation for these proteins as holins arose.  However it appears plausible based on their sequence features. This entry shows similarity to [interpro:IPR046027], a bacterial family of unknown function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23778" "Putative phage holin family 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative phage holin 2", "short" "Phage_holin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 174, "taxa" 733, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 458, "sets" 0, "proteins" 458, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 142}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056964", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056964", "name" "Putative phage holin 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 100, "alignment:full" 189}}}
