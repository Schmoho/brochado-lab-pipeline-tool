{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a structurally complex cofactor, consisting of a modified tetrapyrrole with a centrally chelated cobalt. Cobalamin is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: methylcobalamin and adocobalamin. Most prokaryotes, as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes, whereas plants and fungi do not appear to use it. In bacteria and archaea, these include methionine synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, glutamate and methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, ethanolamine ammonia lyase, and diol dehydratase [[cite:PUB00015657]]. In mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [[cite:PUB00035308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents CobW proteins, which are generally found proximal to the trimeric cobaltochelatase subunit CobN, an essential protein for vitamin B12 (cobalamin) biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00015657]].
