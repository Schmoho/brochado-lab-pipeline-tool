{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is represented by a peptidoglycan deacetylase (HP0310, HpPgdA) from the Gram-negative pathogen Helicobacter pylori. HpPgdA has the ability to bind a metal ion at the active site and is responsible for a peptidoglycan modification that counteracts the host immune response. It functions as a homotetramer. The monomer is composed of a 7-stranded barrel with detectable sequence similarity to the 6-stranded barrel NodB homology domain of polysaccharide deacetylase (DCA)-like proteins in the CE4 superfamily, which removes N-linked or O-linked acetyl groups from cell wall polysaccharides. In contrast to typical NodB-like DCAs, HpPgdA does not exhibit a solvent-accessible polysaccharide binding groove, suggesting that the enzyme binds a small molecule at the active site [[cite:PUB00058910]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes peptidoglycan deacetylase-like protein FGM2 from Gibberella zeae, its function is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10938" "Catalytic domain of Helicobacter pylori peptidoglycan deacetylase (HpPgdA) and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidoglycan deacetylase PgdA-like", "short" "PgdA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1676, "taxa" 6623, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8140, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6070}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
