{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents single domain 2Fe-2S (also called plant type) ferredoxins. In general, these occur as a single domain proteins or with a chloroplast transit peptide. In higher plants, ferredoxin is the unique soluble electron carrier protein located in the stroma, and a wide variety of essential metabolic and signalling processes depend upon the reduction by ferredoxin. Species tend to be photosynthetic, but several forms may occur in one species and individually may not be associated with photosynthesis. For instance, in Arabidopsis two ferredoxins are leaf-type that support high photosynthetic activity, while one is a root-type that is more efficiently reduced under non-photosynthetic conditions and supporting a higher activity of sulphite reduction [[cite:PUB00014946]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6lk1", "name" "Ultrahigh resolution X-ray structure of Ferredoxin I from C. reinhardtii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036010", "name" "2Fe-2S ferredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012675", "name" "Beta-grasp domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02008" "ferredoxin [2Fe-2S]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferredoxin [2Fe-2S], plant", "short" "Fd_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 74, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 690, "taxa" 4580, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6817, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6792, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4660}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010241", :literature {"PUB00014946" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hanke GT" "Kimata-Ariga Y" "Taniguchi I" "Hase T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.103.032755", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "A post genomic characterization of Arabidopsis ferredoxins.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "255-64", "volume" "134", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14684843}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009055", "name" "electron transfer activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051537", "name" "2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0022900", "name" "electron transport chain", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010241", "name" "Ferredoxin [2Fe-2S], plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
