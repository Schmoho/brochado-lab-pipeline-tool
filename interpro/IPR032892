{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase WecB (also known as RffE) from Enterobacteriaceae. WecB is involved in the Enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis, which is part of bacterial outer membrane biogenesis. ECA is a specific surface antigen (polysaccharide) shared by all members of the Enterobacteriaceae and is restricted to this family [[cite:PUB00060945]]. It catalyses the reversible epimerization at C-2 of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and thereby provides bacteria with UDP-N-acetylmannosamine (UDP-ManNAc), the activated donor of ManNAc residues [[cite:PUB00076992]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02028" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase [wecB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase WecB", "short" "WecB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 1181, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1302, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1302, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 983}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
