{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase ([ec:6.3.4.21]) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyses the first reaction in the NAD salvage synthesis [[cite:PUB00067936]]. Members in this family can be split into two further subfamilies represented in [interpro:IPR006405] and [interpro:IPR006406]. Members in [interpro:IPR006405] have a different (longer) spacing of several key motifs and have an additional C-terminal domain of up to 100 residues. However, one argument suggesting that this family represents the same enzyme is that no species has a member of both subfamilies. Another is that the gene encoding this protein is located near other NAD salvage biosynthesis genes in Nostoc and in at least four different Gram-positive bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1vlp", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (yor209c, npt1) from saccharomyces cerevisiae at 1.75 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036068", "name" "Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase-like, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000484" "Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11098" "NICOTINATE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase family", "short" "Nic_PRibTrfase-Fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9171, "taxa" 34864, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36134, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35409, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26823}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1296", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1296"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
