{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CsdE (formerly known as YgdK), the sulphur acceptor subunit of a cysteine desulfurase. This protein, found as a paralogue of SufE in Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Photorhabdus luminescens and related species, works together and physically interacts with CsdA (a paralogue of SufS). CsdA has cysteine desulfurase activity that is enhanced by this protein, where  Cys-61 (numbered as in E. coli) is a sulphur acceptor site. CsdA and CsdE, although involved in FeS cluster biosynthesis, are not encoded next to other like the paralogous Suf proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03391" "cysteine desulfurase sulfur acceptor subunit CsdE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine desulfurase, sulphur acceptor subunit CsdE", "short" "Cysteine_desulfurase_CsdE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 186, "taxa" 1554, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1732, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1732, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1307}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0739", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0739"} {"accession" "GenProp1174", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1174"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017763", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017763", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase, sulphur acceptor subunit CsdE", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
