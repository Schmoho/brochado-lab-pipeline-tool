{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial translation elongation factor G (EF-G) catalyses translocation during peptide elongation and mediates ribosomal disassembly during ribosome recycling with the aid of the ribosomal recycling factor (RRF). This entry represents plant plastid EF-G (also known as SCO1), which displays a 59% homology to prokaryotic EF-G proteins. It is a chloroplast-localised elongation factor involved in protein synthesis in plastids. In Arabidopsis, the mutations in sco1 affect the chloroplast mRNA translation that does not only influence chlorophyll accumulation during chloroplast formation in cotyledons, but also other developmental processes such as germination and flowering [[cite:PUB00074122]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03063" "Elongation factor G, chloroplastic"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Elongation factor G, chloroplastic", "short" "EF_G_plantC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 228, "taxa" 921, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 422, "sets" 0, "proteins" 422, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 250}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030848", :literature {"PUB00074122" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Albrecht V" "Ingenfeld A" "Apel K."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
