{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents proteins that contain an N-terminal CbiX (class II chelatase) domain, and an additional unique C-terminal domain of unknown function.</p>\n\n<p>This group of proteins is able to chelate both Fe<sup>2+</sup>and Co<sup>2+</sup>and can therefore act in both sirohaem and cobalamin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00014361]]. It functions primarily as a cobaltochelatase that inserts cobalt into sirohydrochlorin during the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) [[cite:PUB00000554], [cite:PUB00015833]]. This form of the enzyme contains two copies of the cobalamin biosynthesis CbiX domain ([interpro:IPR002762]),while the stand-alone form contains one. A similar protein named SirB (YlnE), encoded within a small sirohaem biosynthetic operon, has been shown to be capable of inserting ferrous iron into sirohydrochlorin during the biosynthesis of sirohaem [[cite:PUB00015809]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this family belong to the class II chelatases, which are defined as homomeric monofunctional chelatases that do not require ATP for catalysis [[cite:PUB00014361]]. Class II chelatases include, in addition to CbiX and SirB, cobaltochelatase CbiK ([InterPro:IPR010388]) and protoporphyrin ferrochelatase HemH [[cite:PUB00014675]]. All of these enzymes share some distant sequence similarity, and CbiK and HemH have a similar overall topology [[cite:PUB00014383]], which is also predicted for CbiX. It has been suggested that class II chelatases may have evolved from a primordial CbiX<sup>S</sup>type of enzyme [[cite:PUB00014361]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jh3", "name" "The crystal structure of DR2241 from Deinococcus radiodurans at 1.9 A resolution reveals a multi-domain protein with structural similarity to chelatases but also with two additional novel domains"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF018636" "Predicted Co/Fe-chelatase, CbiX type with a unique C-terminal domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Co/Fe-chelatase, CbiX-related", "short" "CbiX-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012374", :literature {"PUB00014361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Brindley AA" "Raux E" "Leech HK" "Schubert HL" "Warren MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
