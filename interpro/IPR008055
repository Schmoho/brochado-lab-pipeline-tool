{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Neurotensin is a 13-residue peptide transmitter, sharing significant similarity in its 6 C-terminal amino acid residues with several other neuropeptides, including neuromedin N (which is derived from the same precursor). This C-terminal region is responsible for the full biological activity, the N-terminal portion having a modulatory role.</p>\n\n<p>Neurotensin is distributed throughout the central nervous system, with highest levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. It induces a variety of effects, including: analgesia, hypothermia and increased locomotor activity. It is also involved in regulation of dopamine pathways. In the periphery, neurotensin is found in endocrine cells of the small intestine, where it leads to secretion and smooth muscle contraction [[cite:PUB00010549]]. The neurotensin/neuromedin N precursor can also be processed to produce large 125-138 amino acid peptides with the neurotensin or neuromedin N sequence at their C terminus. These large peptides appear to be less potent than their smaller counterparts, but are also less sensitive to degradation and may represent endogenous, long-lasting activators in a number of pathophysiological situations.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07421" "Neurotensin/neuromedin N precursor"}, "panther" {"PTHR15356" "NEUROTENSIN/NEUROMEDIN N"}, "prints" {"PR01668" "NEUROTENSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neurotensin/neuromedin N", "short" "NeurotensiN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 591, "taxa" 2027, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 916, "sets" 0, "proteins" 839, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 590}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008055", :literature {"PUB00010549" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Friry C" "Feliciangeli S" "Richard F" "Kitabgi P" "Rovere C."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
