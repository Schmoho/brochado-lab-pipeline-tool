{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase is involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), a critical precursor for glycan synthesis. In vertebrates it is involved in the biosynthesis of matrix glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfan) which play significant roles in signaling, inflammation, morphogenesis, cancer growth and matrix organisation [[cite:PUB00056285]]. In plants, it provides nucleotide sugars for cell-wall polymers [[cite:PUB00068160]].
