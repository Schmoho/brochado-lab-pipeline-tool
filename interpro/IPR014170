{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are Gram-negative bacterial inner membrane proteins, generally designated ExbD, related to the TolR [interpro:IPR014168]. Members are always found next to a protein designated ExbB ([interpro:IPR014164]), which is related to the TolQ family ([interpro:IPR014163]). ExbD and ExbB together form a proton channel through which they can harness the proton-motive force to energize TonB, which in turn energizes TonB-dependent receptors in the outer membrane. TonB-dependent receptors with known specificity tend to import siderophores or vitamin B12. A TonB system and Tol-Pal system often will co-exist in a single bacterial genome.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02803" "TonB system transport protein ExbD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TonB system transport protein ExbD type-1", "short" "TonB_ExbD_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 596, "taxa" 3586, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3699, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3699, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2971}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0543", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0543"} {"accession" "GenProp1157", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1157"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014170", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0055085", "name" "transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003400", "name" "Biopolymer transport protein ExbD/TolR", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR014168", "name" "Tol-Pal system protein TolR", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR014170", "name" "TonB system transport protein ExbD type-1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR014171", "name" "TonB system transport protein ExbD type-2", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
