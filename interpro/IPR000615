{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Bestrophin family that includes four paralogous genes in mammals (BEST1, BEST2, BEST3, BEST4) encoding integral membrane calcium (Ca2+)-activated chloride (Cl-) channels. In humans, they are widely distributed in various organs including the airways, colon, kidney, pancreas and central nervous system, but best known for their physiological roles in the eye. In particular, BEST1 that is genetically linked to a spectrum of retinal degenerative disorders collectively known as bestrophinopathies [[cite:PUB00153738], [cite:PUB00153737], [cite:PUB00153739]]</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Bestrophin is a 68kDa basolateral plasma membrane protein expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). It is encoded by the VMD2 gene, which is mutated in Best macular dystrophy, a disease characterised by a depressed light peak in the electrooculogram [[cite:PUB00011864]]. VMD2 encodes a 585-amino acid protein with an approximate mass of 68kDa which has been designated bestrophin. Bestrophin shares homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans RFP gene family, named for the presence of a conserved arginine (R), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), amino acid sequence motif. Bestrophin is a plasma membrane protein, localised to the basolateral surface of RPE cells consistent with a role for bestrophin in the generation or regulation of the EOG light peak. Bestrophin and other RFP family members represent a new class of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC) [[cite:PUB00096752]], indicating a direct role for bestrophin in generating the light peak [[cite:PUB00011864], [cite:PUB00096747], [cite:PUB00096748]]. Bestrophins are also permeable to other monovalent anions including bicarbonate, bromine, iodine, thiocyanate an nitrate [[cite:PUB00096752], [cite:PUB00096748]]. Structural analysis revealed that N-terminal region of the proteins is highly conserved and sufficient for its CaCC activity. The C-terminal region has low sequence identity. The VMD2 gene underlying Best disease was shown to represent the first human member of the RFP-TM protein family. More than 97% of the disease-causing mutations are located in the N-terminal domain altering the electrophysiological properties of the channel [[cite:PUB00096752], [cite:PUB00011865]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8d1n", "name" "bBest2_345 Ca2+-bound open state"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10736" "BESTROPHIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bestrophin", "short" "Bestrophin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1021, "taxa" 4077, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8456, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8456, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5581}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000615", :literature {"PUB00011864" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Stohr H" "Marquardt A" "Nanda I" "Schmid M" "Weber BH."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
