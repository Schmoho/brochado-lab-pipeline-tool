{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>At least five distinct pathways exist for the catabolism of propionate by way of propionyl-CoA. Most members of this family are bacterial proteins known or predicted to act as 2-methylcitrate dehydratase; an enzyme which catalyses the third step the methylcitrate cycle of propionate catabolism [[cite:PUB00019867]]. A related clade of archaeal proteins that may or may not be functionally equivalent is excluded from this family. The PrpD enzyme of Escherichia coli is responsible for the minor aconitase activity (AcnC) not accounted for by AcnA and AcnB [[cite:PUB00017752]]. Some proteins in this entry are annotated as MmgE, a Bacillus subtilis protein encoded within an operon which is expressed during sporulation, subject to catabolite repression [[cite:PUB00033360]].  An enzyme from Bacillus subtilis (citrate/2-methylcitrate synthase) acts as both a citrate synthase and a methylcitrate synthase [[cite:PUB00033360], [cite:PUB00090961]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5mux", "name" "Crystal structure of 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (MmgE) from Bacillus subtilis."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042183", "name" "MmgE/PrpD superfamily, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036148", "name" "MmgE/PrpD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02330" "2-methylcitrate dehydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-methylcitrate dehydratase PrpD", "short" "2Me_IsoCit_deHydtase_PrpD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1728, "taxa" 6888, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4838}, "pathways" 52}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1687"} {"accession" "GenProp0240", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0240"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
