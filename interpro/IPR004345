{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes members from a wide variety of eukaryotes and includes Receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEPs), its homologues from fungi Yop1 and similar sequences from plants. REEP/DP1/Yop1 family of proteins are involved in the control of endoplasmic reticulum organisation and mutations in some members of this family are associated with inherited diseases like Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) [[cite:PUB00095230], [cite:PUB00155129]]. REEP5, also known as TB2/DP1 (deleted in polyposis) protein [[cite:PUB00155131]], plays an essential role in heart function and development by regulating the organization and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiomyocytes [[cite:PUB00155130]]. In human is deleted in severe forms of familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal dominant oncological inherited disease [[cite:PUB00020410]].</p>\n\n<p>The family also includes the plant protein of known similarity to TB2/DP1, the HVA22 abscisic acid-induced protein, which is thought to be a regulatory protein [[cite:PUB00020411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03134" "TB2/DP1, HVA22 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12300" "HVA22-LIKE PROTEINS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TB2/DP1/HVA22", "short" "TB2_DP1_HVA22"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 336, "proteomes" 2684, "taxa" 11023, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22036, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21908, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13639}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004345", :literature {"PUB00020411" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Shen Q" "Uknes SJ" "Ho TH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
