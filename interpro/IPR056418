{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Tail Tube Terminator Protein family is involved in the assembly of bacteriophage tail structures. Members of this family, such as the Tail Tube Terminator Protein p142, are responsible for capping the tail tube during its polymerisation, ensuring that it reaches the correct length [[cite:PUB00155631]]. This capping function is crucial for the proper formation of the phage tail, which is essential for the phage's ability to infect host bacteria by facilitating the injection of genetic material.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23818" "Bacteriophage Tail Tube Terminator Protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tail tube terminator protein p142", "short" "Phage_tail_terminator_p142"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 517, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 342, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056418", :literature {"PUB00155631" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Linares R" "Arnaud CA" "Effantin G" "Darnault C" "Epalle NH" "Boeri Erba E" "Schoehn G" "Breyton C."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade9674", "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Structural basis of bacteriophage T5 infection trigger and <i>E. coli</i> cell wall perforation.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "eade9674", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36961893}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056418", "name" "Tail tube terminator protein p142", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 10, "alignment:full" 44}}}
