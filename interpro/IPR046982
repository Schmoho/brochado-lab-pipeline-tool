{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a group of BAR-domain containing proteins, including BIN3 from human, its homologues RVS161 and hob3 from S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, respectively, and related proteins, which contain the N-BAR domain, related to the amphiphysin family of proteins [[cite:PUB00086944], [cite:PUB00101553]]. BIN3 is widely expressed in many tissues except in the brain. It plays roles in regulating filamentous actin localization and in cell division [[cite:PUB00086944]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes reduced viability upon starvation protein 167 (RVS167) from S. cerevisiae and its homologue in S. pombe, hob1 [[cite:PUB00101550], [cite:PUB00101551], [cite:PUB00101552]]. RVS161/167 are components of a cytoskeletal structure that is required for the formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane level and form a complex that regulates actin, endocytosis, and viability following starvation or osmotic stress. Hob1 is structurally similar to RVS167, while hob3 is more similar to human BIN3 and RVS161, however, neither hob1 nor hob3 is required for endocytosis, [[cite:PUB00101552]]. Hob1 is dispensable for endocytosis, actin organization, or osmotic sensitivity but it participates in DNA damage signalling as a part of stress response processes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2a08", "name" "Structure of the yeast YHH6 SH3 domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47174" "BRIDGING INTEGRATOR 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bridging integrator 3/RVS161-like", "short" "BIN3/RVS161-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 53, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1989, "taxa" 6637, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6964, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6964, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4383}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046982", :literature {"PUB00101552" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Coll PM" "Rincon SA" "Izquierdo RA" "Perez P."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Hob3p, the fission yeast ortholog of human BIN3, localizes Cdc42p to the division site and regulates cytokinesis.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1865-77", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17363901}, "PUB00101551" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Friesen H" "Colwill K" "Robertson K" "Schub O" "Andrews B."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Interaction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cortical actin patch protein Rvs167p with proteins involved in ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "555-68", "volume" "170", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15802519}, "PUB00101553" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Douglas LM" "Martin SW" "Konopka JB."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "BAR domain proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 contribute to Candida albicans endocytosis, morphogenesis, and virulence.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "4150-60", "volume" "77", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19596778}, "PUB00101550" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Routhier EL" "Donover PS" "Prendergast GC."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "hob1+, the fission yeast homolog of Bin1, is dispensable for endocytosis or actin organization, but required for the response to starvation or genotoxic stress.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "637-48", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12569356}, "PUB00086944" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Routhier EL" "Burn TC" "Abbaszade I" "Summers M" "Albright CF" "Prendergast GC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
