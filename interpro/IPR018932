{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents Salivary thrombin inhibitor anophelin from Anopheles albimanus and similar proteins from insects. AT is a salivary protein with anticoagulant activity that inhibits host thrombin (F2), the peptidase that is at the end of the blood coagulation cascade and which creates the clot by cleaving fibrinogen [[cite:PUB00044904], [cite:PUB00154982], [cite:PUB00154983]]. The interaction between thrombin and fibrinogen involves two different areas of contact - via the thrombin active site and via a second substrate-binding site known as an exosite. The inhibitor acts by blocking the exosite, rather than by interacting with the active site. The inhibitors are from mosquitoes that feed on human blood and which, by inhibiting thrombin, prevent the blood from clotting and keep it flowing.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5nhu", "name" "HUMAN ALPHA THROMBIN COMPLEXED WITH ANOPHELES GAMBIAE cE5 ANTICOAGULANT"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10731" "Thrombin inhibitor from mosquito"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Salivary thrombin inhibitor anophelin, mosquito", "short" "Thrombin_inhibitor_anophelin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 79, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018932", :literature {"PUB00154982" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["Francischetti IM" "Valenzuela JG" "Ribeiro JM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1021/bi991231p", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Anophelin: kinetics and mechanism of thrombin inhibition.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "16678-85", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10600131}, "PUB00154983" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Figueiredo AC" "de Sanctis D" "Gutierrez-Gallego R" "Cereija TB" "Macedo-Ribeiro S" "Fuentes-Prior P" "Pereira PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211614109", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Unique thrombin inhibition mechanism by anophelin, an anticoagulant from the malaria vector.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "E3649-58", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23223529}, "PUB00044904" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Valenzuela JG" "Francischetti IM" "Ribeiro JM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi990761i", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Purification, cloning, and synthesis of a novel salivary anti-thrombin from the mosquito Anopheles albimanus.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "11209-15", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10460178}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018932", "name" "Salivary thrombin inhibitor anophelin, mosquito", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 2}}}
