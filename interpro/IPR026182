{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human ANAPC15 is a component of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In the complex, it plays a role in the release of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) from the APC/C; it is not required for APC/C activity itself, but promotes the turnover of CDC20 and MCC on the APC/C, thereby participating to the responsiveness of the spindle assembly checkpoint. It also required for degradation of CDC20 [[cite:PUB00060168]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15243" "Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 15"}, "panther" {"PTHR22526" "ANAPHASE PROMOTING COMPLEX C SUBUNIT 15, PSEUDOGENE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 15", "short" "ANAPC15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 898, "taxa" 3951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1753, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1749, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1157}, "pathways" 76}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026182", :literature {"PUB00060168" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Mansfeld J" "Collin P" "Collins MO" "Choudhary JS" "Pines J."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
