{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The small Ras-like GTPase Ran plays an essential role in the transport of macromolecules in and out of the nucleus and has been implicated in spindle and nuclear envelope formation during mitosis in higher eukaryotes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORF YGL164c encoding a novel RanGTP-binding protein, termed Yrb30p was identified. The protein competes with S. cerevisiae RanBP1 (Yrb1p) for binding to the GTP-bound form of S. cerevisiae Ran (Gsp1p) and is, like Yrb1p, able to form trimeric complexes with RanGTP and some of the karyopherins [[cite:PUB00011451]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31010" "RAN-SPECIFIC GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 30-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF05508" "RanGTP-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran-related", "short" "Ran_GTP-bd-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 874, "taxa" 2283, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1301, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 829}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008812", :literature {"PUB00011451" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Braunwarth A" "Fromont-Racine M" "Legrain P" "Bischoff FR" "Gerstberger T" "Hurt E" "Kunzler M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
