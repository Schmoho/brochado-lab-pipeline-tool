{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is encoded within the CRISPR-associated RAMP module, a set of six genes found together in prokaryotic genomes [[cite:PUB00020781]]. This gene cluster is found only in species with CRISPR repeats, usually near the repeats themselves. Because most of the six genes (but not those encoding this entry) contain RAMP domains, and because its appearance in a genome appears to depend on other CRISPR-associated Cas genes, the set is designated the CRISPR RAMP module. This entry represents Cmr2, the largest and an essential subunit of a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex (the Cmr complex) which was originally thought to be the catalytic subunit of the effector complex, however, in vitro studies showed that Cmr2 is not required for cleavage and suggested that another component provides the catalytic function. Therefore, the essential role by Cmr2 does not require the ADP- or metal-binding or HD domains [[cite:PUB00065747]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic defence mechanism against foreign genetic elements.
