{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is a complex consisting of 17 subunits, which synthesizes small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs. Pol III is essential for efficient transcription from both the type 2 VAI and type 3 U6 RNA polymerase III promoters and plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses, being involved in innate immune response, as it induces type I interferon and NF-Kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway [[cite:PUB00060118]]. DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC5 is a specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III complex. This subunit forms a subcomplex with RPC4 which is close to the active centre allowing the formation of the open promoter complex and facilitates termination and reinitiation. RPC5 mutations are associated with impaired type I INF and increased susceptibility to viral infections [[cite:PUB00095453]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7asv", "name" "Crystal structure of tWHD2 of Rpc5 subunit of human RNA Polymerase III"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12069" "DNA-DIRECTED RNA POLYMERASES III 80 KDA POLYPEPTIDE RNA POLYMERASE III SUBUNIT 5"}, "pfam" {"PF04801" "RPC5 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit Rpc5", "short" "RNA_pol_III_Rpc5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 77, "proteomes" 2608, "taxa" 8908, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5248, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3293}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006886", :literature {"PUB00095453" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Ramanathan A" "Weintraub M" "Orlovetskie N" "Serruya R" "Mani D" "Marcu O" "Stepensky P" "Weisblum Y" "Djian E" "Shaag A" "Revel-Vilk S" "Fried I" "Kotler M" "Rouvinski A" "Wolf D" "Elpeleg O" "Jarrous N."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
