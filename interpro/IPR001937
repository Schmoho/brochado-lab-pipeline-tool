{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase [ec:2.7.7.12] (GalT) catalyses the transfer of an uridyldiphosphate group on galactose (or glucose) 1-phosphate. During the reaction, the uridyl moiety links to a histidine residue. In the Escherichia coli enzyme, it has been shown [[cite:PUB00004352]] that two histidine residues separated by a single proline residue are essential for enzyme activity.</p>\r\n<p>On the basis of sequence similarities, two apparently unrelated families seem to exist. Class-I enzymes are found in eukaryotes as well as some bacteria such as E. coli or Streptomyces lividans, while class-II enzymes have been found so far only in bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis or Lactobacillus helveticus [[cite:PUB00002146]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gup", "name" "STRUCTURE OF NUCLEOTIDYLTRANSFERASE COMPLEXED WITH UDP-GALACTOSE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036265", "name" "HIT-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11943" "GALACTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE"}, "cdd" {"cd00608" "GalT"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000808" "Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00209" "galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, class I", "short" "GalP_UDPtransf1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5173, "taxa" 20931, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20805, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20539, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15167}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00108", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00108"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0143", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0143"} {"accession" "GenProp1310", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1310"} {"accession" "GenProp1661", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1661"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
