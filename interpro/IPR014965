{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Solution of the structure of the Lactobacillus plantarum protein from this family has indicated a potential new fold with remote similarities to TBP-like (TATA-binding protein) structures. This similarity, in combination with genomic context analysis, leads us to propose an involvement in amino-acid metabolism. The potentially novel fold is an α + β fold comprising two β sheets packed against a single helix [[cite:PUB00055862]].
