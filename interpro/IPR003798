{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein contains several bacterial RmuC DNA recombination proteins. The function of the RMUC protein is unknown but it is suspected that it is either a structural protein that protects DNA against nuclease action, or is itself involved in DNA cleavage at the regions of DNA secondary structures [[cite:PUB00020261]]. Proteins in this family are predicted to contain a central endonuclease-like fold domain, surrounded by coiled coils, consistent with a direct role in DNA cleavage [[cite:PUB00020736], [cite:PUB00054003]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30563" "DNA RECOMBINATION PROTEIN RMUC"}, "pfam" {"PF02646" "RmuC family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA recombination RmuC", "short" "DNA_recombination_RmuC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 46, "proteomes" 5981, "taxa" 24933, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31018, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30978, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23702}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003798", :literature {"PUB00020736" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kinch LN" "Ginalski K" "Rychlewski L" "Grishin NV."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki676", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Identification of novel restriction endonuclease-like fold families among hypothetical proteins.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3598-605", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15972856}, "PUB00020261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Slupska MM" "Chiang JH" "Luther WM" "Stewart JL" "Amii L" "Conrad A" "Miller JH."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00341.x", "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Genes involved in the determination of the rate of inversions at short inverted repeats.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "425-37", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10886369}, "PUB00054003" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kosinski J" "Feder M" "Bujnicki JM."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Bioinformatics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-6-172", "medline_journal" "BMC Bioinformatics", "title" "The PD-(D/E)XK superfamily revisited: identification of new members among proteins involved in DNA metabolism and functional predictions for domains of (hitherto) unknown function.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "172", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16011798}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003798", "name" "DNA recombination RmuC", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 243, "alignment:full" 6107}}}
