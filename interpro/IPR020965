{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes prenyltransferase-like proteins, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aromatic prenyltransferases NovQ from Streptomyces niveus and CloQ from Streptomyces roseochromogenes. They catalyse the transfer of a dimethylallyl group to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to produce the ring A structure in the novobiocin and clorobiocin biosynthesis pathways, respectively [[cite:PUB00072698], [cite:PUB00072699]].</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Flaviolin linalyltransferase from Streptomyces cinnamonensis. It is involved in the biosynthesis of furanonaphthoquinone I (FNQ I). It catalyses C- and O-prenylations of different phenolic substrates [[cite:PUB00072912], [cite:PUB00072911]].</li>\r\n\r\n<li>5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylate 9-dimethylallyltransferase from Streptomyces anulatus. It is involved in the biosynthesis of prenylated phenazines. It catalyses the transfer of a dimethylallyl moiety to C-9 of 5,10-dihydrophenazine 1-carboxylate (dihydro-PCA). It is specific for both dimethylallyl diphosphate and dihydro-PCA [[cite:PUB00072913]].</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1zdy", "name" "Co-crystal structure of Orf2 an aromatic prenyl transferase from Streptomyces sp. strain CL190 complexed with TAPS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036239", "name" "Prenyltransferase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01163" "II"}, "cdd" {"cd13931" "Aromatic Prenyltransferases (PTases) of the CloQ/NphB family"}, "pfam" {"PF11468" "Aromatic prenyltransferase Orf2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aromatic prenyltransferase, CloQ-type", "short" "Prenyltransferase_CloQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 161, "taxa" 587, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 490, "sets" 0, "proteins" 489, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 364}, "pathways" 44}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
