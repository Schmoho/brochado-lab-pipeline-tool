{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ethylene insensitive 3 (EIN3) proteins are a family of plant DNA-binding proteins that regulate transcription in response to the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, and are essential for ethylene-mediated responses [[cite:PUB00101835]]. In the presence of ethylene, dark-grown dicotyledonous seedlings undergo dramatic morphological changes collectively known as the 'triple response'. In Arabidopsis, these changes consist of a radial swelling of the hypocotyl, an exaggeration in the curvature of the apical hook, and the inhibition of cell elongation in the hypocotyl and root [[cite:PUB00019506], [cite:PUB00019507]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4zds", "name" "Crystal Structure of core DNA binding domain of Arabidopsis Thaliana Transcription Factor Ethylene-Insensitive 3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023278", "name" "Ethylene insensitive 3-like protein, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33305" "ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 2 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ethylene insensitive 3", "short" "EIN3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 1060, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3049, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3049, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1847}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006957", :literature {"PUB00101835" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Song J" "Zhu C" "Zhang X" "Wen X" "Liu L" "Peng J" "Guo H" "Yi C."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Biochemical and Structural Insights into the Mechanism of DNA Recognition by Arabidopsis ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e0137439", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26352699}, "PUB00019506" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Chao Q" "Rothenberg M" "Solano R" "Roman G" "Terzaghi W" "Ecker JR."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80300-1", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Activation of the ethylene gas response pathway in Arabidopsis by the nuclear protein ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 and related proteins.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "1133-44", "volume" "89", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9215635}, "PUB00019507" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Chang C" "Shockey JA."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
