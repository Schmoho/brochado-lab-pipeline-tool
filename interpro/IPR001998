{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Xylose isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.5]) [[cite:PUB00001569]] is an enzyme found in microorganisms which catalyzes the interconversion of D-xylose to D-xylulose. It can also isomerize D-ribose to D-ribulose and D-glucose to D-fructose. The enzyme is a homotetramer, which is stabilised by cobalt, and requires magnesium for its catalytic activity. Each subunit contains 2 domains: the core domain is a parallel α-β barrel; the C-terminal domain is a loop structure consisting of 5 helices and is involved in intermolecular contacts between adjacent subunits [[cite:PUB00003247]]. The active site lies in a deep pocket near the C-terminal ends of the strands of the barrel domain and includes residues from a second subunit. The tetramer is effectively a dimer of \"active\" dimers, the active sites being composed of residues from both subunits [[cite:PUB00003247]].</p>\r\n<p>Xylose isomerase also exists in plants [[cite:PUB00001465]] where it is homodimeric and is manganese-dependent.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ktc", "name" "Crystal structure of Putative sugar isomerase (YP_050048.1) from ERWINIA CAROTOVORA ATROSEPTICA SCRI1043 at 1.54 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036237", "name" "Xylose isomerase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48408" "PTHR48408"}, "profile" {"PS51415" "Xylose isomerase family profile"}, "hamap" {"MF_00455" "Xylose isomerase [xylA]"}, "prints" {"PR00688" "XYLOSISMRASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Xylose isomerase", "short" "Xylose_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 196, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4063, "taxa" 15839, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18917, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18770, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14468}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00156", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00156"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
