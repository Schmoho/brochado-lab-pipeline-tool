{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit A of topoisomerase VI, a type IIB topoisomerase found predominantly in archaea, but also in a few eukayotes, such as the plant Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00020804]]. This enzyme assembles as a heterotetramer, consisting of two A subunits required for DNA cleavage and two B subunits required for ATP hydrolysis. The B subunit is structurally similar to the ATPase domain of type IIA topoisomerases, but the A subunit is distinct, and instead shares homology with the Spo11 protein that mediates double-strand DNA breaks during meiotic recombination in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00007202]]. The core of subunit A is a dimer, with a deep groove in which the DNA molecule is thought to bind, with the monomers separating during DNA transport. Therefore, though related to type IIA topoisomerases, topoisomerase VI may have a distinctive mechanism of action.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>DNA topoisomerases regulate the number of topological links between two DNA strands (i.e. change the number of superhelical turns) by catalysing transient single-or double-strand breaks, crossing the strands through one another, then resealing the breaks [[cite:PUB00005437]].
