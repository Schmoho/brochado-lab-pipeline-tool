{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Coronavirus encodes two viroporins, E protein and protein 3a, which act as ion-conductive pores in planar lipid bilayers and are required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence [[cite:PUB00094125]]. In betacoronavirus, this protein plays a role in viral egress via lysosomal trafficking [[cite:PUB00097964], [cite:PUB00100499]]. Protein 3a from SARS-CoV-2 also blocks autolysosomes formation by binding and sequestering the host component VPS39 for homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) on late endosomes. This prevents fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, disrupting autophagy and facilitating virus egress [[cite:PUB00097963]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents protein 3a encoded by Orf3/3a, also known as X1, which forms homotetrameric potassium, sodium or calcium sensitive ion channels (viroporin) and may modulate virus release. It has also been shown to up-regulate expression of fibrinogen subunits FGA, FGB and FGG in host lung epithelial cells [[cite:PUB00056030], [cite:PUB00056031], [cite:PUB00056032], [cite:PUB00094124]].</p>\n\n<p>3a protein is a pro-apoptosis-inducing protein. It localises to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment. SARS-CoV causes apoptosis of infected cells through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as ORF3a is a potent activator of the signals required for this activation, pro-IL-1beta gene transcription and protein maturation. This protein also promotes the ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) mediated by its interaction with TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). The expression of ORF3a induces NF-kappa B activation and up-regulates fibrinogen secretion with the consequent high cytokine production [[cite:PUB00056032], [cite:PUB00094124], [cite:PUB00075660], [cite:PUB00075661]]. Another apoptosis mechanism described for this protein is the activation of the PERK pathway of unfolded protein response (UPR), which causes phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and leads to reduced translation of cellular proteins as well as the activation of pro-apoptotic downstream effectors (i.e ATF4, CHOP) [[cite:PUB00075662]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21648" "accessory protein ORF3a of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and similar proteins from related betacoronavirus"}, "pfam" {"PF11289" "Betacoronavirus viroporin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein 3a, betacoronavirus", "short" "Protein_3a_bCoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 128, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 657, "sets" 0, "proteins" 639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024407", :literature {"PUB00075662" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Minakshi R" "Padhan K" "Rani M" "Khan N" "Ahmad F" "Jameel S."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008342", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The SARS Coronavirus 3a protein causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and induces ligand-independent downregulation of the type 1 interferon receptor.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e8342", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20020050}, "PUB00075661" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shen S" "Lin PS" "Chao YC" "Zhang A" "Yang X" "Lim SG" "Hong W" "Tan YJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
