{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of plant lysine-rich arabinogalactan proteins, including AGP9/17/18 from Arabidopsis. They are members of the lysine-rich arabinogalactan protein (AGP) subfamily within the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) superfamily. AGPs are hyperglycosylated proteins implicated in different aspects of plant growth and development. Protein backbones of AGPs are rich in Pro/Hyp (hydroxyproline), Ser, Ala and Thr and are modified by the addition of type II arabinogalactan polysaccharides and arabinose oligosaccharides to Hyp residues [[cite:PUB00088431]]. They are predicted to contain the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and are localized to the plasma membrane. AtAGP18 is involved in a signal transduction pathway regulating plant growth and development [[cite:PUB00097663]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37209" "LYSINE-RICH ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN 17-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysine-rich arabinogalactan protein AGP9/17/18", "short" "AGP9/17/18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 206, "taxa" 826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 936, "sets" 0, "proteins" 936, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 542}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044981", :literature {"PUB00088431" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yang J" "Zhang Y" "Liang Y" "Showalter AM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00407.x", "medline_journal" "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "title" "Expression analyses of AtAGP17 and AtAGP19, two lysine-rich arabinogalactan proteins, in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "431-8", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21489093}, "PUB00097663" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Yang J" "Showalter AM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "title" "AtAGP18, a lysine-rich arabinogalactan protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, functions in plant growth and development as a putative co-receptor for signal transduction.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "855-7", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21849816}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005886", "name" "plasma membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044981", "name" "Lysine-rich arabinogalactan protein AGP9/17/18", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
