{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents IbpB, which belongs to the small heat shock protein (HSP20) family. IbpB associates with aggregated proteins, together with IbpA, to stabilise and protect them from irreversible denaturation and extensive proteolysis during heat shock and oxidative stress. Aggregated proteins bound to the IbpAB complex are more efficiently refolded and reactivated by the ATP-dependent chaperone systems ClpB and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. Its activity is ATP-independent.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008978", "name" "HSP20-like chaperone", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02001" "Small heat shock protein IbpB [ibpB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small heat shock protein IbpB", "short" "HSP20_IbpB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 52, "taxa" 806, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 791, "sets" 0, "proteins" 791, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 607}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022848", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022848", "name" "Small heat shock protein IbpB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
