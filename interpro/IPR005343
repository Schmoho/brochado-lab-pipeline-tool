{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nucleolar complex protein 2 (Noc2) forms a nucleolar complex with Mak21 that binds to 90S and 66S pre-ribosomes. It also forms a nuclear complex with Noc3 that binds to 66S pre-ribosomes [[cite:PUB00020526]]. Both complexes mediate intranuclear transport of ribosomal precursors [[cite:PUB00020526]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, Noc2 (also known as NIR) acts as an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase activity; prevents acetylation of all core histones by the EP300/p300 histone acetyltransferase at p53/TP53-regulated target promoters in a histone deacetylases (HDAC)-independent manner. It also acts as a transcription corepressor of p53/TP53- and TP63-mediated transactivation of the p21/CDKN1A promoter. It is involved in the regulation of p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis [[cite:PUB00063056], [cite:PUB00063057], [cite:PUB00063058]].</p>\n\n<p>Nucleolar complex-associated protein 2 (Noc2) from Arabidopsis thaliana appears to be involved in pre-ribosome export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00090619]]. Also from A.thaliana, Protein REBELOTE influences floral meristem (FM) determinacy in an AGAMOUS and SUPERMAN-dependent manner, thus contributing to the floral developmental homeostasis [[cite:PUB00100279]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03715" "Noc2p family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12687" "NUCLEOLAR COMPLEX 2 AND RAD4-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleolar complex protein 2", "short" "Noc2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 83, "proteomes" 2592, "taxa" 10403, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6273, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3564}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005343", :literature {"PUB00063056" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Hublitz P" "Kunowska N" "Mayer UP" "Muller JM" "Heyne K" "Yin N" "Fritzsche C" "Poli C" "Miguet L" "Schupp IW" "van Grunsven LA" "Potiers N" "van Dorsselaer A" "Metzger E" "Roemer K" "Schule R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.351205", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "NIR is a novel INHAT repressor that modulates the transcriptional activity of p53.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2912-24", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16322561}, "PUB00063057" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Heyne K" "Willnecker V" "Schneider J" "Conrad M" "Raulf N" "Schule R" "Roemer K."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq016", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "NIR, an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases, regulates transcription factor TAp63 and is controlled by the cell cycle.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "3159-71", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20123734}, "PUB00063058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wu L" "Ma CA" "Zhao Y" "Jain A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
