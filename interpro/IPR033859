{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a conserved protein complex that regulates the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of SCF-type E3 ligase complexes [[cite:PUB00078142]], which leads to a decrease in Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2 [[cite:PUB00087569]]. Protein kinases CK2 and D, which phosphorylate proteins such as cJun and p53 resulting in their degradation by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system, also binds to CSN [[cite:PUB00087570], [cite:PUB00087571]]. The mammalian CSN typically consistis of eight subunits designated CSN1-CSN8. The fission yeast possesses a smaller version of the CSN, consisting only of six subunits, whereas a more distant CSN-like complex has been described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00088094]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>CSN6 (COP9 signalosome subunit 6; COP9 subunit 6; MOV34 homolog, 34 kD; MEROPS identifier M67.972) is one of the eight subunits of COP9 signalosome. CSN6 is an MPN-domain protein that directly interacts with the MPN+-domain subunit CSN5 [[cite:PUB00081745]]. It is cleaved during apoptosis by activated caspases. CSN6 processing occurs in CSN/CRL (cullin-RING Ub ligase) complexes and is followed by the cleavage of Rbx1, the direct interaction partner of CSN6 [[cite:PUB00081449]]. CSN6 cleavage enhances CSN-mediated deneddylating activity (i.e. cleavage of ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8)) in the cullin 1 in cells [[cite:PUB00081450]]. The cleavage of Rbx1 and increased deneddylation of cullins inactivate CRLs and presumably stabilize pro-apoptotic factors for final apoptotic steps. While CSN6 shows a typical MPN metalloprotease fold, it lacks the canonical JAMM motif, and therefore does not show catalytic isopeptidase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4qft", "name" "Structure of COP9 signalosome complex subunit 6"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08063" "Mpr1p, Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domains without catalytic isopeptidase activity, found in COP9 signalosome complex subunit 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "COP9 signalosome subunit 6", "short" "MPN_CSN6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1900, "taxa" 6808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3279, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3279, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2025}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2047", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2047"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033859", :literature {"PUB00088094" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Wei N" "Serino G" "Deng XW."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
