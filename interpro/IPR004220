{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase transforms 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxy-muconic acid into 5-oxo-pent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylic acid during the third step of the homoprotocatechuate catabolic pathway [[cite:PUB00035626]]. Homoprotocatechuate (HPC; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate) is catabolized to Krebs cycle intermediates via extradiol (meta-) cleavage and the necessary enzymes are chromosomally encoded in a variety of bacteria [[cite:PUB00043417]]. 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase is probably a dimer of two identical subunits [[cite:PUB00035626]]. A comparison of the N-terminal half of the isomerase/decarboxylase sequence from the pathway (both encoded by the gene hpcE), with the second half showed significant similarity. This suggests that a duplication may have occurred to produce a bifunctional gene [[cite:PUB00001446]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3e6q", "name" "Putative 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014347", "name" "Tautomerase/MIF superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00580" "CHMI"}, "panther" {"PTHR37950" "4-HYDROXYPHENYLACETATE CATABOLISM PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF02962" "5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase", "short" "5-COMe_2-OHmuconate_Isoase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 1328, "taxa" 6591, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7302, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7302, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5633}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0231", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0231"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
