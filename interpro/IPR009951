{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Gam protein, originally characterised in Bacteriophage Mu, protects linear double stranded DNA from exonuclease degradation<i>in vitro</i>and<i>in vivo</i>[[cite:PUB00013109]]. This protein is also found in many bacterial species as part of a suspected prophage. Further studies have shown that Gam is a functional counterpart of the eukaryotic Ku protein, which has key roles in DNA repair and in certain transposition events.\r\nGam displays DNA binding characteristics remarkably similar to those of human Ku [[cite:PUB00014993]]. In addition, Gam can interfere with Ty1 retrotransposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast). These data reveal structural and functional parallels between bacteriophage Gam and eukaryotic Ku and suggest that their functions have been evolutionarily conserved [[cite:PUB00014993]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07352" "Bacteriophage Mu Gam like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Host-nuclease inhibitor protein Gam", "short" "Host-nuc_inhib_Gam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 373, "taxa" 2723, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2021, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2021, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1433}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009951", :literature {"PUB00014993" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["d'Adda di Fagagna F" "Weller GR" "Doherty AJ" "Jackson SP."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO Rep.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.embor709", "medline_journal" "EMBO Rep", "title" "The Gam protein of bacteriophage Mu is an orthologue of eukaryotic Ku.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "47-52", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12524520}, "PUB00013109" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Akroyd JE" "Clayson E" "Higgins NP."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/14.17.6901", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Purification of the gam gene-product of bacteriophage Mu and determination of the nucleotide sequence of the gam gene.", "year" 1986, "raw_pages" "6901-14", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2945162}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003690", "name" "double-stranded DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0042262", "name" "DNA protection", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009951", "name" "Host-nuclease inhibitor protein Gam", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR009859", "name" "Protein of unknown function, Gam-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 39, "alignment:full" 418}}}
