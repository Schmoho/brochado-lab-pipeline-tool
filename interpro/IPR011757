{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of lytic murein transglycosylases (murein hydrolases) related to MltB ([swissprot:P41052]), which is a 38kDa membrane-bound lipoprotein in Escherichia coli. The N-terminal region of this protein contains a lipoprotein-processing site which is conserved in about half the members of this family. Proteolytic cleavage of MltB produces a fully-active, soluble form of this enzyme known as Slt35 (for soluble lytic transglycosylase). This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in peptidoglycan. Its physiological role is unknown as deletion of the gene shows no obvious phenotype [[cite:PUB00028076]], though it has been suggested to play a role in recycling of muropeptides during cell elongation and/or cell division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Slt35 enzyme is a monomer with an ellipsoid shape and is composed of three distinct domains known as the alpha, beta and core domains [[cite:PUB00027135], [cite:PUB00028077]]. The alpha domain contains mainly α-helices, while the beta domain consists of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by a short α-helix. The core domain is sandwiched between the alpha and beta domains and its fold is similar to that of lysozyme, but contains a single metal ion binding site in a helix-loop-helix module that is similar to the eukaryotic EF-hand calcium-binding fold, though in this case the loop is slightly longer than usual. Binding of Ca(2+) to this EF hand motif has been shown to be important for thermal stability of the protein [[cite:PUB00028078]]. The substrate binding sites are found in the cleft formed by the core domain of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00024079]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this family do not contain the putative peptidoglycan binding domain described by [interpro:IPR002477], which is associated with several other classes of bacterial cell wall lytic enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ltm", "name" "ACCELERATED X-RAY STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION OF A 36 KDA MURAMIDASE/TRANSGLYCOSYLASE USING WARP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023346", "name" "Lysozyme-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02282" "lytic murein transglycosylase B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lytic transglycosylase MltB", "short" "Lytic_transglycosylase_MltB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1392, "taxa" 6522, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7737, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7737, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5899}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011757", :literature {"PUB00028076" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ehlert K" "Holtje JV" "Templin MF."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
