{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TTLL10 is a polyglycylase, which modifies both tubulin and non-tubulin proteins, generating side chains of glycine on the Î³-carboxyl groups of specific glutamate residues of target proteins [[cite:PUB00066571]]. It polyglycylates alpha tubulin and beta tubulin, but is not able to initiate glycylation and only has activity toward monoglycylated tubulin [[cite:PUB00066572]]. It has the ability to polyglycylate non-tubulin proteins such as NAP1; in this case it can initiate glycylation and does not require preliminary monoglycylation by another glycylase [[cite:PUB00066573]].</p>\r\n<p>This family also includes [swissprot:Q6ZVT0], which is inactive [[cite:PUB00066571]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46810" "INACTIVE POLYGLYCYLASE TTLL10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein polyglycylase TTLL10", "short" "TTLL10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 467, "taxa" 1900, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1185, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1185, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 823}, "pathways" 44}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
