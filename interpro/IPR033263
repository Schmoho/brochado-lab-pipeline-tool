{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNF180 (also known as Rines: RING finger protein in neural stem cells) is an integral membrane protein located mainly on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. It promotes polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome pathway of ZIC2. It is thought that it is involved in modulation of neuronal function, such as regulation of synaptic structure and synaptic plasticity due to its high expression in mature brain. It has been related to neurodegenerative diseases and to disorders associated with emotion [[cite:PUB00078285], [cite:PUB00098997]]. Methylation of RNF180 has been linked to gastric cancer [[cite:PUB00078286], [cite:PUB00098998]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46717" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE RNF180"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF180", "short" "RNF180"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 642, "taxa" 2711, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1233, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1233, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 750}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
