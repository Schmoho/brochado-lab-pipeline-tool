{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Canonical DinG is a bacterial helicase with 5'->3' polarity. In the bacilli and clostridia, the DinG helicase has become fused with an N-terminal exonuclease domain and lacks the FeS-binding domain essential for the helicase activity. Instead of being an helicase, the enzyme is a 3'->5' exonuclease acting on single-stranded DNA and RNA substrates. The inactive helicase domain seems to have a role in the control of the nuclease activity. By degrading rather than displacing RNA or DNA strands, exonuclease DinG may accomplish the same function as the canonical DinG helicase [[cite:PUB00088400]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02206" "3'-5' exonuclease DinG [dinG]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01407" "putative DnaQ family exonuclease/DinG family helicase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3'-5' exonuclease DinG", "short" "DinG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 838, "taxa" 3280, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4055, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4055, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3021}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006310", :literature {"PUB00088400" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["McRobbie AM" "Meyer B" "Rouillon C" "Petrovic-Stojanovska B" "Liu H" "White MF."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
