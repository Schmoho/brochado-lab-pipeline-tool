Dok proteins are involved in processes such as modulation of cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as in control of the cell spreading and migration The Dok protein contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a central phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which has a PH-like fold, and a proline- and tyrosine-rich C-terminal tail. The PH domain binds to acidic phospholids and localizes proteins to the plasma membrane, while the PTB domain mediates protein-protein interactions by binding to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs [[cite:PUB00087566]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21636" "PROTEIN DOK-7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein Dok-7", "short" "Dok-7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 860, "taxa" 3398, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1968, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1968, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1158}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037746", :literature {"PUB00065407" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bergamin E" "Hallock PT" "Burden SJ" "Hubbard SR."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
