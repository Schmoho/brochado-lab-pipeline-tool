{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of uncharacterised homologues of Site-2 protease (S2P), zinc metalloproteases from the MEROPS family M50, which cleave transmembrane domains of substrate proteins, regulating intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of diverse signal transduction mechanisms. Members of the S2P/M50 family of RIP proteases transfer information across membranes through its proteolytic activity, connecting gene expression with physiologic stresses occurring in another cellular compartment [[cite:PUB00096378]]. In eukaryotic cells they regulate different processes including sterol and lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. In prokaryotes they regulate sporulation, cell division, stress response, and cell differentiation. This group includes S2P/M50s homologues with a minimal core protein and no PDZ domains [[cite:PUB00096377], [cite:PUB00050509]], including the putative zinc metalloprotease Rip2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06158" "S2P-M50_like_1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterized M50 metalloprotease, S2P-like", "short" "S2P-M50-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3485, "taxa" 15916, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19018, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19017, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14471}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
