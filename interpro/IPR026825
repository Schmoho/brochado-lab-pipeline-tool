{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Vac14 is a component of the PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex, which regulates both the synthesis and turnover of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) [[cite:PUB00061897]]. This complex is composed of Atg18, Fig4, Fab1, Vac14 and Vac7 in yeast. In mammals it consists of PIKfyve, FIG4 and VAC14. Fab1/PIKfyve (Fab1 in yeast and PIKfyve in mammals) is a kinase that converts PI(3)P into PI(3,5)P2 by phosphorylation at the 5-position; conversely Fig4 dephosphorylates PI(3,5)P2 back to PI(3)P. Vac14 is a scaffolding adaptor protein whose multimerisation is a prerequisite step for PI(3,5)P2 complex assembly and function [[cite:PUB00069629]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16023" "TAX1 BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuole morphology and inheritance protein 14", "short" "Vac14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2592, "taxa" 8753, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5752, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5752, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3615}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026825", :literature {"PUB00061897" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Jin N" "Chow CY" "Liu L" "Zolov SN" "Bronson R" "Davisson M" "Petersen JL" "Zhang Y" "Park S" "Duex JE" "Goldowitz D" "Meisler MH" "Weisman LS."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2008.248", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "VAC14 nucleates a protein complex essential for the acute interconversion of PI3P and PI(3,5)P(2) in yeast and mouse.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "3221-34", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19037259}, "PUB00069629" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Alghamdi TA" "Ho CY" "Mrakovic A" "Taylor D" "Mao D" "Botelho RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
