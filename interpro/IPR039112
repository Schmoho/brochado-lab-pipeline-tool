{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PID1 (PTB-containing, cubilin and LRP1-interacting protein; also known as NYGGF4)  is a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain-containing protein. It is an inhibitor of insulin-mediated signaling in adipocytes and muscle cells. It binds through its PTB domain to the second NPXY motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)[[cite:PUB00088940]]. Besides being involved in obesity-associated insulin resistance [[cite:PUB00088941]], PID1 has been shown to inhibit growth of medulloblastoma, glioblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour cell lines [[cite:PUB00088940]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011993", "name" "PH-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16265" "PTB-CONTAINING, CUBILIN AND LRP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1", "short" "PID1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 627, "taxa" 2188, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 693}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039112", :literature {"PUB00088940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Xu J" "Ren X" "Pathania AS" "Fernandez GE" "Tran A" "Zhang Y" "Moats RA" "Shackleford GM" "Erdreich-Epstein A."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00947-6", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "PID1 increases chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells in a manner that involves NFÎºB.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "835", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28400607}, "PUB00088941" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Shi CM" "Wang YM" "Zhang CM" "Qiu J" "Shen YH" "Zhu JG" "Chen L" "Xu GF" "Zhao YP" "Ji CB" "Guo XR."], "ISO_journal" "Mitochondrion", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2012.10.008", "medline_journal" "Mitochondrion", "title" "Knockdown of NYGGF4 (PID1) rescues insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by FCCP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "600-6", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23085536}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042127", "name" "regulation of cell population proliferation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0046627", "name" "negative regulation of insulin receptor signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051881", "name" "regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039112", "name" "Phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
