This subunit contains a tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) prosthetic group derived from Trp-114 and Trp-165 of the precursor, numbered according to the sequence from Paracoccus denitrificans [[cite:PUB00021028], [cite:PUB00065256]]. The enzyme forms a complex with the type I blue copper protein amicyanin and cytochrome.
