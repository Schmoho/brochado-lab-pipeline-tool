{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a Wee1-like protein kinase ([ec:2.7.10.2]), which is a key regulator for G(2)-to-M progression. This enzyme phosphorylates Tyr15 on Cdc2 (cell division control protein 2) when Cdc2 is complexed to cyclin B1, which results in blocking the progression of cells into M phase [[cite:PUB00044669]]. As such, it negatively regulates the entry of a cell into mitosis (G2 to M transition) by protecting the nucleus from cytoplasmically activated cyclin B1-complexed Cdc2 before the onset of mitosis [[cite:PUB00042736], [cite:PUB00044670]]. The activity of this enzyme increases during S and G2 phases and decreases at M phase when it is hyperphosphorylated; it is then ubiquitinated and degraded at the onset of G2/M phase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037281" "Wee1-like protein kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Wee1-like protein kinase", "short" "Wee1-like_protein_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 780, "taxa" 3032, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2513, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2139, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1415}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
