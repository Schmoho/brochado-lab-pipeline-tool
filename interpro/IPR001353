In eukaryotes the 20S proteasome is composed of 28 distinct subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure (20S ring) of about 700kDa.  Proteasome subunits can be classified on the basis of sequence similarities into two groups, alpha (A) and beta (B). The proteasome consists of four stacked rings composed of α/β/β/α subunits. There are seven different alpha subunits and seven different beta subunits [[cite:PUB00030848]]. Three of the seven beta subunits are peptidases, each with a different specificity.  Subunit beta1c (MEROPS identifier T01.010) has a preference for cleaving glutaminyl bonds (\"peptidyl-glutamyl-like\" or \"caspase-like\"), subunit beta2c (MEROPS identifier T01.011) has a preference for cleaving arginyl and lysyl bonds (\"trypsin-like\"), and subunit beta5c (MEROPS identifier T01.012) cleaves after hydrophobic amino acids (\"chymotrypsin-like\") [[cite:PUB00080992]].
