{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (or isopropylmalate isomerase; [ec:4.2.1.33]) catalyses the stereo-specific isomerisation of 2-isopropylmalate and 3-isopropylmalate, via the formation of 2-isopropylmaleate. This enzyme performs the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine, and is present in most prokaryotes and many fungal species. The prokaryotic enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a large (LeuC) and small (LeuD) subunit, while the fungal form is a monomeric enzyme. Both forms of isopropylmalate are related and are part of the larger aconitase family [[cite:PUB00005471]]. Aconitases are mostly monomeric proteins which share four domains in common and contain a single, labile [4Fe-4S] cluster. Three structural domains (1, 2 and 3) are tightly packed around the iron-sulphur cluster, while a fourth domain (4) forms a deep active-site cleft. The prokaryotic enzyme is encoded by two adjacent genes, leuC and leuD, corresponding to aconitase domains 1-3 and 4 respectively [[cite:PUB00033924], [cite:PUB00016210]]. LeuC does not bind an iron-sulphur cluster. It is thought that some prokaryotic isopropylamalate dehydrogenases can also function as homoaconitase [ec:4.2.1.36], converting cis-homoaconitate to homoisocitric acid in lysine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00032014]]. Homoaconitase has been identified in higher fungi (mitochondria) and several archaea and one thermophilic species of bacteria, Thermus thermophilus [[cite:PUB00036023]].  It is also found in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, where it is targeted to the chloroplast [[cite:PUB00082326]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the large subunit of 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, or the large subunit domain of single-chain forms of this enzyme.
