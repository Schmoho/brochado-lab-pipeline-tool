{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The independent cloning of rodent EBF/Olf-1 and Drosophila melanogaster Collier has defined a family of transcription factors, the Collier or COE family [[cite:PUB00006682]]. COE proteins have various functions in different organisms.</p>\n\n<p>In mouse, COE1 has a role in B-cell differentiation, and could also perform a role in neuronal differentiation. All three COE are expressed in immature olfactory neuronal precursors and mature olfactory neurons as well as in developping nervous system during embryogenesis.</p>\n\n<p>In Drosophila, Collier is involved in the formation of the embryonic somatic muscle DA3, in the patterning of the wing by mediating Hedgehog activity. It could also act as a second-level regulator in the patterning of embryonic head.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3muj", "name" "Early B-cell factor 3 (EBF3) IPT/TIG and dimerization helices"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038173", "name" "Transcription factor COE, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10747" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR COE FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor COE", "short" "Transcription_factor_COE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1010, "taxa" 3921, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7965, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7965, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4683}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC01044", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC01044"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003523", :literature {"PUB00006682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Crozatier M" "Valle D" "Dubois L" "Ibnsouda S" "Vincent A."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/126/19/4385", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Head versus trunk patterning in the Drosophila embryo; collier requirement for formation of the intercalary segment.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "4385-94", "volume" "126", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10477305}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003523", "name" "Transcription factor COE", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
