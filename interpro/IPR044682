{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) is localised in the thylakoid lumen and catalyses the two-step mono de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to form antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin, to control the concentration of zeaxanthin in chloroplasts. It is part of a conserved system that dissipates excess energy as heat in the light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II (PSII) and protects them from photodamage [[cite:PUB00096785], [cite:PUB00096784], [cite:PUB00096786]]. The thylakoid lumen pH decreases under excessive light that allows VDE to attach to the thylakoid membrane where violaxanthin is located. This acidic condition causes the opening of the lipocalin barrel [[cite:PUB00096786]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3cqr", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Lipocalin domain of Violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) at pH5"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33970" "VIOLAXANTHIN DE-EPOXIDASE, CHLOROPLASTIC-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Violaxanthin de-epoxidase", "short" "VDE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 333, "taxa" 1510, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1487, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1487, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 955}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
