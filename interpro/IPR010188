{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes HisA (1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5-phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino] imidazole-4-carboxamide isomerase) and  HisA homologues from Actinobacteria, known as PriA (phosphoribosyl Isomerase A). These enzymes are involved in both the histidine and tryptophan biosynthetic pathways.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to their ancestral HisA activity, PriA enzymes also have a proficient N'-(5'-phosphoribosyl) anthranilate (PRA) isomerase or TrpF activity. Therefore, where a trpF gene is lacking, as in the Actinobacteria or Gram-positive eubacteria with high (G C) content, PriA participates in the biosynthesis of both L-histidine and L-tryptophan [[cite:PUB00093465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2y88", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS PHOSPHORIBOSYL ISOMERASE (VARIANT D11N) WITH BOUND PRFAR"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01919" "bifunctional 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-((5-phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino)imidazole-4-carboxamide isomerase/phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase PriA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HisA/PriA, Actinobacteria", "short" "HisA/PriA_Actinobacteria"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1844, "taxa" 5108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4915, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4915, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3905}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0037"} {"accession" "GenProp0109", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0109"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
