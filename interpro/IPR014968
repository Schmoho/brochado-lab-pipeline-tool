{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains XisI proteins, also known as FdxN element excision controlling factors, and similar proteins. FdxN element is excised from the chromosome during heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria. This is accomplished by the large serine recombinase XisF (fdxN element site-specific recombinase). The xisH as well as the xisF and xisI genes are required. XisI may function as recombination directionality factor (RDF), and needs XisH which may function as an endonuclease [[cite:PUB00035486]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2nwv", "name" "Crystal structure of XisI protein-like (YP_323822.1) from Anabaena Variabilis ATCC 29413 at 1.85 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035943", "name" "XisI-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16382" "XisI is FdxN element excision controlling factor protein"}, "pfam" {"PF08869" "XisI protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "XisI protein", "short" "XisI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 189, "taxa" 1253, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5456, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5456, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4080}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014968", :literature {"PUB00035486" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ramaswamy KS" "Carrasco CD" "Fatma T" "Golden JW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
