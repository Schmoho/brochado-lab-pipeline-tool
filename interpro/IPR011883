{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase, subunit D (also know as PaaD) and related bacterial proteins. PaaD ia a component of 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase multicomponent enzyme system which catalyses the reduction of phenylacetyl-CoA (PA-CoA) to form 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA. The subunit D may have a function related to the maturation of the monooxygenase complex, rather than direct involvement in catalysis. PaaD could assist either in maturation of PaaE or PaaA [[cite:PUB00010200], [cite:PUB00153012]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Phenylacetate-CoA oxygenase is comprised of a five gene complex responsible for the hydroxylation of phenylacetate-CoA (PA-CoA) as the second catabolic step in phenylacetic acid (PA) degradation [[cite:PUB00005820], [cite:PUB00010200]].
