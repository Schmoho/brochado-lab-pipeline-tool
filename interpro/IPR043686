{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Uup is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein of the F type (ABCF).  It has ATPase activity and possesses two nucleotide binding domains which comprise Walker A/B motifs connected by a linker and a coiled-coil C-terminal domain. It binds double-stranded DNA with no sequence specificity [[cite:PUB00076511]]. The Uup ATPase activity functions cooperatively thus the inactivation of one site suppresses all ATP hydrolytic activity [[cite:PUB00094461]]. It is implicated in precise excision of transposons. It bind to branched DNAs and is involved in resolution of branched DNA intermediates that result from template switching in post replication gaps [[cite:PUB00094461]].It may also be involved in the 50S ribosome subunit assembly due to its genetic interaction with translational GTPase BipA [[cite:PUB00093675]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00848" "ATP-binding protein Uup [uup]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-binding protein Uup", "short" "Uup"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2273, "taxa" 10182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10809, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10809, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8279}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
