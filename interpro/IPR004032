{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Several vertebrate small integral membrane glycoproteins are evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00002934], [cite:PUB00002936], [cite:PUB00001869]], including eye lens specific membrane protein 20 (MP20 or MP19); epithelial membrane protein-1 (EMP-1), which is also known as tumor-associated membrane protein (TMP) or as squamous cell-specific protein Cl-20; epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP-2), which is also known as XMP; epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP-3), also known as YMP; and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22), which is expressed in many tissues but mainly by Schwann cells as a component of myelin of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). PMP-22 probably plays a role both in myelinization and in cell proliferation. Mutations affecting PMP-22 are associated with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT-1A) in human or the trembler phenotype in mice. The proteins of this family are about 160 to 173 amino acid residues in size, and contain four transmembrane segments. PMP-22, EMP-1, -2 and -3 are highly similar, while MP20 is more distantly related.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS01222" "PMP-22 / EMP / MP20 family signature 2", "PS01221" "PMP-22 / EMP / MP20 family signature 1"}, "prints" {"PR01453" "EPMEMFAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PMP-22/EMP/MP20", "short" "PMP22_EMP_MP20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 652, "taxa" 2255, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17928, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3078}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00939", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00939"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004032", :literature {"PUB00002934" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Taylor V" "Welcher AA" "Program AE" "Suter U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
