Rtf2 was thought to stabilise the replication fork stalled at the RTS1 element by preventing replication restart until completion of DNA synthesis by a converging replication fork initiated at a flanking origin [[cite:PUB00066779]]. However, this protein has been later reported to be associated with mRNA processing and splicing factors, and essential for the correct splicing of the rtf1 transcript, necessary for a functional Rtf1 protein (Replication Termination Factor 1) and thus for RTS activity [[cite:PUB00153784]].
