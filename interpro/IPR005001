{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the RNA-binding pleiotropic regulator Hfq, a small, Sm-like protein of bacteria [[cite:PUB00103793]]. It helps pair regulatory non-coding RNAs with complementary mRNA target regions. It enhances the elongation of poly(A) tails on mRNA [[cite:PUB00017770]]. It appears also to protect RNase E recognition sites (A/U-rich sequences with adjacent stem-loop structures) from cleavage [[cite:PUB00017771]]. Being pleiotropic, it differs in some of its activities in different species. Hfq binds the non-coding regulatory RNA DsrA (see Rfam:RF00014) in the few species known to have it: Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella spp. In Azorhizobium caulinodans, an hfq mutant is unable to express nifA, and Hfq is called NrfA, for nif regulatory factor [[cite:PUB00016696]]. The name Hfq reflects phenomenology as a host factor for phage Q-beta RNA replication.</p>\n\n<p>The Hfq protein is conserved in a wide range of bacteria and varies in length from 70 to 100 amino acids. In all cases, a conserved Sm motif is located in the N-terminal halves of the molecules. The Hfq protein of E. coli is an 11kDa polypeptide that forms a hexameric ring-shaped structure. Structural studies have suggested that the β4 strand in one molecule dimerises with the β5 strand of a neighbouring subunit to form the hexamer. These two strands move with a concerted mobility which may explain the stability of the entire structure [[cite:PUB00007236]].</p>\n\n<p>The architecture of the Hfq-RNA complex suggests two, not mutually exclusive, mechanisms by which Hfq might exert its function as modulator of RNA-RNA interactions. First, when Hfq binds single-stranded RNA, the target site is unwound in a circular manner. This would greatly destabilise surrounding RNA structures that are located several nucleotides on either side of the binding site, thereby permitting new RNA-RNA interactions. Secondly, the repetition of identical BPs on the Hfq hexamer implies that the binding surface can accommodate more than just a single RNA target. This would allow simultaneous binding of two RNA strands and could greatly enhance interaction between the strands [[cite:PUB00014979]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4pno", "name" "Escherichia coli Hfq-RNA complex at 0.97 A Resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010920", "name" "LSM domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17209" "Hfq protein"}, "cdd" {"cd01716" "bacterial Hfq-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR34772" "RNA-BINDING PROTEIN HFQ"}, "hamap" {"MF_00436" "RNA-binding protein Hfq [hfq]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02383" "RNA chaperone Hfq"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding protein Hfq", "short" "Hfq"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 70, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 4319, "taxa" 16606, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18624, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17959, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13939}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005001", :literature {"PUB00016696" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kaminski PA" "Desnoues N" "Elmerich C."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
