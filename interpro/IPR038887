{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nus1 (also known as Nogo-B receptor, NgBR) is a subunit of cis-prenyltransferase, a enzymatic activity critical for the synthesis of dolichol, an obligate carrier of oligosaccharides for protein glycosylation reactions [[cite:PUB00088515]]. It plays an essential role in angiogenesis during wound healing and embryonic development. In mice, it is essential for endothelial cell glycosylation and vascular development [[cite:PUB00088516]]. In zebrafish, it is bound by Nogo-B ligand that activates Akt pathway to stimulate endothelial cell chemotaxis [[cite:PUB00088517]].
