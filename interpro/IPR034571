{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Several peroxisome biogenesis factors, termed peroxins (PEXs), are involved in the transport of peroxisomal proteins from the cytosol to peroxisomes. ABERRANT PEROXISOME MORPHOLOGY9 (APEM9) is involved in peroxisomal protein transport through its recruitment of the AAA ATPase complex PEX1-PEX6 to peroxisomal membranes via protein-protein interactions with PEX6 [[cite:PUB00083731]]. APEM9 has a similar function in plants to mammalian Pex26 and yeast Pex15p, although the amino acid conservation among them is very low. APEM9 plays critical roles in peroxisome biogenesis and function, which is essential for jasmonic acid production and pollen maturation and germination [[cite:PUB00083732]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36361" "PROTEIN APEM9"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein APEM9", "short" "APEM9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 962, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 581, "sets" 0, "proteins" 581, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 349}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034571", :literature {"PUB00083731" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Goto S" "Mano S" "Nakamori C" "Nishimura M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.110.080770", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis ABERRANT PEROXISOME MORPHOLOGY9 is a peroxin that recruits the PEX1-PEX6 complex to peroxisomes.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1573-87", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21487094}, "PUB00083732" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Li XR" "Li HJ" "Yuan L" "Liu M" "Shi DQ" "Liu J" "Yang WC."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.113.121087", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis DAYU/ABERRANT PEROXISOME MORPHOLOGY9 is a key regulator of peroxisome biogenesis and plays critical roles during pollen maturation and germination in planta.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "619-35", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24510720}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015919", "name" "peroxisomal membrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034571", "name" "Protein APEM9", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
