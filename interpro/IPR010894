The functions of the proteins encoded by the spoVA operon are unknown, but it has been suggested they are involved in DPA transport during sporulation [[cite:PUB00008450]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3lma", "name" "Crystal structure of the stage V sporulation protein AD (SpoVAD) from Bacillus licheniformis.
