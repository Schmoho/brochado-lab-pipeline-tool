{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>All tRNA molecules are synthesised as long precursors with extra sequence at both the 5' and 3' ends, which undergo several processing steps to form the mature tRNA molecule. In many bacteria, the tRNA precursors do not contain the CCA sequence which forms the 3' end of the mature tRNA and is essential for aminoacylation. In these organisms ribonucleotide Z cleaves the precursor to form a 3' end to which CCA is added. Proteins in this entry, by contrast, are ribonuclease Z enzymes with unusual activity, found in the genus Thermotoga, which include the CCA sequence in the tRNA precursor and ribonuclease Z cleaves the molecule immediately after this sequence producing a mature 3' end. The sequence of these proteins differs considerably from the majority of ribonuclease Z sequences [[cite:PUB00047351], [cite:PUB00021022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2e7y", "name" "High resolution structure of T. maritima tRNase Z"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02650" "ribonuclease Z, Thermotoga type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease Z, Thermotoga-type", "short" "RNase_Z_T_toga"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 22, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013470", :literature {"PUB00021022" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Ishii R" "Minagawa A" "Takaku H" "Takagi M" "Nashimoto M" "Yokoyama S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
