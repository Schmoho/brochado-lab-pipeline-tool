{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include UL42 proteins found in Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). UL42 has two Pro-Pro-X-Tyr (PPxY) sequences, a hydrophobic region at the C terminus and no N-terminal signal peptide. These features are shared with herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL56. UL42 has a putative C-terminal trans-membrane region. HCMV UL42 interacts with Itch, a member of the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, through its PY motifs as observed in HSV UL56, suggestive of a regulatory function [[cite:PUB00085198]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17638" "HCMV UL42"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HCMV protein UL42", "short" "UL42"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 59, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 55, "sets" 0, "proteins" 55, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035110", :literature {"PUB00085198" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Koshizuka T" "Tanaka K" "Suzutani T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
