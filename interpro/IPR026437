{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a rare family of small putative polypeptides, including three encoded in tandem in Sphingobacterium spiritivorum ATCC 33300, in the vicinity of a [ncbifam:TIGR04085] protein. This pairing is conserved in Chryseobacterium gleum ATCC 35910, Kordia algicida OT-1, and other species. TIGR04085 describes a C-terminal additional 4Fe4S-binding domain in PqqE and other radical SAM enzymes that seems to be a marker for peptide modification, and the family here is a candidate modified peptide precursor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04139" "TIGR04139 family peptide modification target"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative peptide modification target", "short" "CxxCx5CxxC_targ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 86, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 98, "sets" 0, "proteins" 98, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 94}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1002", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1002"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026437", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026437", "name" "Putative peptide modification target", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
