{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ras-related protein Rab33 is a member of the large Rab GTPase family. Rab33B is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues and cells, where it is localized to the medial Golgi cisternae. It colocalizes with alpha-mannose II. Together with the other cisternal Rabs, Rab6A and Rab6A', it is believed to regulate the Golgi response to stress and is likely a molecular target in stress-activated signaling pathways [[cite:PUB00091893]]. Rab33A (previously known as S10) is expressed primarily in the brain and immune system cells. In humans, it is located on the X chromosome at Xq26 and its expression is down-regulated in tuberculosis patients. Experimental evidence suggests that Rab33A is a novel CD8+ T cell factor that likely plays a role in tuberculosis disease processes [[cite:PUB00091895]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1z06", "name" "GppNHp-Bound Rab33 GTPase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04115" "Rab GTPase family 33 includes Rab33A and Rab33B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab33A/B", "short" "Rab33A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 735, "taxa" 2815, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1797, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1797, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1208}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041822", :literature {"PUB00020223" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Stenmark H" "Olkkonen VM."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11387043&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The Rab GTPase family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS3007", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11387043}, "PUB00033000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Dumas JJ" "Zhu Z" "Connolly JL" "Lambright DG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80054-9", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural basis of activation and GTP hydrolysis in Rab proteins.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "413-23", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10196122}, "PUB00091893" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zheng JY" "Koda T" "Fujiwara T" "Kishi M" "Ikehara Y" "Kakinuma M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
