{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Mad1 and Cdc20-bound-Mad2 binding proteins that are involved in the cell-cycle surveillance mechanism called the spindle checkpoint [[cite:PUB00053369]]. This mechanism monitors the proper bipolar attachment of sister chromatids to spindle microtubules and ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. A key player in mitosis is Mad2, which exhibits an unusual two-state behaviour. A Mad1-Mad2 core complex recruits cytosolic Mad2 to kinetochores through Mad2 dimerisation and converts Mad2 to a conformer amenable to Cdc20 binding. p31comet inactivates the checkpoint by binding to Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2 in such a way as to stop Mad2 activation and to promote the dissociation of the Mad2-Cdc20 complex [[cite:PUB00049186]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053729", "name" "MAD2L1-binding domain-containing protein", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15681" "MAD2L1-BINDING PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF06581" "Mad1 and Cdc20-bound-Mad2 binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mad1/Cdc20-bound-Mad2 binding protein", "short" "MAD1/Cdc20-bound-Mad2-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 1127, "taxa" 4521, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1863, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1210}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009511", :literature {"PUB00049186" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Yang M" "Li B" "Tomchick DR" "Machius M" "Rizo J" "Yu H" "Luo X."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.048", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "p31comet blocks Mad2 activation through structural mimicry.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "744-55", "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18022368}, "PUB00053369" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Habu T" "Kim SH" "Weinstein J" "Matsumoto T."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf659", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Identification of a MAD2-binding protein, CMT2, and its role in mitosis.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "6419-28", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12456649}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007096", "name" "regulation of exit from mitosis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009511", "name" "Mad1/Cdc20-bound-Mad2 binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 850}}}
