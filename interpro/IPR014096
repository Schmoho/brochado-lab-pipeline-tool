{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are the beta subunit of phenylphosphate carboxylase. Phenol (methyl-benzene) is converted to phenylphosphate, then para-carboxylated by this four-subunit enzyme, with the release of phosphate, to 4-hydroxybenzoate. The enzyme contains neither biotin nor thiamin pyrophosphate. This beta subunit is homologous to the alpha subunit and, more broadly, to UbiD family decarboxylases [[cite:PUB00034531]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02724" "phenylphosphate carboxylase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phenylphosphate carboxylase, beta subunit", "short" "Phenyl_P_COase_b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 263, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 205, "sets" 0, "proteins" 205, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 141}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014096", :literature {"PUB00034531" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Schuhle K" "Fuchs G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
