{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of aminotransferases, including ALAT1/2 from humans. ALAT1/2 catalyzes the reversible transamination between alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to form pyruvate and glutamate [[cite:PUB00098013]]. This entry also includes ALAT1/2 found in Arabidopsis mitochondria and GGAT1/2 found in Arabidopsis peroxisomes. GGAT1/2 catalyzes the Glu:glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGT), Ala:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), Ala:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (AKT) and Glu:pyruvate aminotransferase (GPT) reactions in peroxisomes [[cite:PUB00098017]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11751" "ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminotransferase ALAT1/2-like", "short" "ALAT1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2607, "taxa" 9305, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9826, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9826, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6108}, "pathways" 64}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
