{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins, predominantly found in Gammaproteobacteria, has no known function. The conserved hypothetical protein VC1805 from Vibrio cholerae is included in this entry. VC1805 adopts a monomeric assembly, showing an unusual topology with a flat seven-stranded anti-parallel Î²-sheet and two helices located on the same side of the sheet. It has some structural homology with the human protein p32 and binds to the complement protein C1q, which suggests a possible role in the adherence of the bacteria to the intestinal wall [[cite:PUB00049533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2w56", "name" "Structure of the hypothetical protein VC0508 from Vibrio cholerae VSP- II pathogenicity island"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38978" "DUF2787 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF10980" "Protein of unknown function (DUF2787)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF2787", "short" "DUF2787"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 635, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1134, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1134, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 766}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021248", :literature {"PUB00049533" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sheikh MA" "Potter JA" "Johnson KA" "Sim RB" "Boyd EF" "Taylor GL."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.21993", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of VC1805, a conserved hypothetical protein from a Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity island, reveals homology to human p32.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1563-71", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18300248}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021248", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF2787", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 120}}}
