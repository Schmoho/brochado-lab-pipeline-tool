{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins of unknown function. The crystal structure of HP0242, a hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori (Campylobacter pylori) has been determined. It reveals an acid-adaptive protein possibly of physiological significance when H. pylori colonises the human stomach. The protein adopts a unique four Î±-helical triangular conformations. The biologically active form is thought to be a tetramer. The gene exist in an operon along with 6 other genes where the gene products appear to be related to iron storage and haem biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00039697]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4u12", "name" "Crystal structure of protein HP0242 from Helicobacter pylori at 1.94 A resolution: a knotted homodimer"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023126", "name" "HP0242-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09442" "Domain of unknown function (DUF2018)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF2018", "short" "DUF2018"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 472, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 516, "sets" 0, "proteins" 516, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 441}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018563", :literature {"PUB00039697" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Tsai JY" "Chen BT" "Cheng HC" "Chen HY" "Hsaio NW" "Lyu PC" "Sun YJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.20864", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of HP0242, a hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori with a novel fold.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1138-43", "volume" "62", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16395670}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018563", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF2018", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 79}}}
