{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of aspartic peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family A22 (presenilin family, clan AD): subfamily A22A, the type example being presenilin 1 from Homo sapiens (Human).</p>\n\n<p>Presenilins are polytopic transmembrane (TM) proteins, mutations in which are associated with the occurrence of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, a rare form of the disease that results from a single-gene mutation [[cite:PUB00000974], [cite:PUB00002010]]. The physiological functions of presenilins are unknown, but they may be related to developmental signalling, apoptotic signal transduction, or processing of selected proteins, such as the beta-amyloid precursor protein(beta-APP). There are a number of subtypes which belong to this presenilin family. That presenilin homologues have been identified in species that do not have an Alzhemier's disease correlate suggests that they may have functions unrelated to the disease, homologues having been identified in mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00004220]] and other members of the eukarya including plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01074" "PRESENILIN2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase A22A, presenilin 2", "short" "Pept_A22A_PS2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 381, "taxa" 1191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1979, "sets" 0, "proteins" 691, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 506}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
