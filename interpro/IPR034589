{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The mannonate dehydratase (manD) group consists of the subset of enolase superfamily enzymes with a conserved tyrosine, presumably acting as an active site base, at the position of Y159 in the experimentally characterized manD from<i>Novosphingobium aromaticivorans</i>. An additional conserved arginine controls the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>of this tyrosine (R147 in<i>N. aromaticivorans</i>manD). At the present time, mannonate dehydratase is the only characterized family within this group. Other enzymes within the group have been shown to catalyze the low efficiency dehydration of D-gluconate and/or D-mannonate, but the biologically relevant function of these enzymes is unclear [[cite:PUB00049026], [cite:PUB00083762], [cite:PUB00083763]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qjj", "name" "Crystal structure of D-Mannonate dehydratase from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036849", "name" "Enolase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR029017", "name" "Enolase-like, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG00033" "mannonate dehydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-mannonate dehydratase-like", "short" "D-mannonate_dehydratase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 939, "taxa" 4383, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4350, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4350, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3432}, "pathways" 54}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
