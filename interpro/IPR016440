{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductases. This includes enzymes such as the flavorubredoxin oxidoreductase NorV (or nitric oxide reductase flavorubredoxin) that contains one rubredoxin domain and binds FMN as a cofatror, acting to sense nitric oxide (NO) by formation of a mono-nitrosyl iron complex. NorV uses NADH to detoxify nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions, thereby protecting several 4Fe-4S NO-sensitive enzymes [[cite:PUB00042734], [cite:PUB00042735]]. NorV has at least two reductase partners, one of which is NorW (flavorubredoxin reductase). NorV can also function as an aerobic oxygen reductase.</p>\n<p>Other enzymes include the metalloflavoprotein FprA (also known as F420H2 oxidase) that functions as a low-potential electron donor to a number of redox enzymes [[cite:PUB00032624]], it catalyses the oxidation of two coenzymes F420H2 with one O2 to two coenzyme F420 and two H2O [[cite:PUB00093740], [cite:PUB00042197]]. There is also FpaA (flavoprotein A) that probably functions as an electron acceptor for a hydrogenase [[cite:PUB00042737]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ohh", "name" "Crystal Structure of coenzyme F420H2 oxidase (FprA), a diiron flavoprotein, active oxidized state"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005243" "Rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductase", "short" "Rubredoxin-O_OxRdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1593, "taxa" 8493, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11278, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11270, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8842}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
