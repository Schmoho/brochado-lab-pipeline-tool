{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the virulence-associated protein, VapD type, found in bacteria. These proteins are defined by a conserved region found at the N terminus of the protein [[cite:PUB00010080]]. The crystal structure VapD from Helicobacter pylori, which showed endoribonuclease activity, was solved by X-ray chrystallography, showing a modified ferredoxin-like fold, very similar to that of the Cas2 family. It was also related to toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, sltho it does not belong to them [[cite:PUB00094356]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002882" "Virulence-associated protein, VapD type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endoribonuclease VapD", "short" "VapD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 82, "taxa" 813, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 444, "sets" 0, "proteins" 444, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 379}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016368", :literature {"PUB00010080" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Katz ME" "Strugnell RA" "Rood JI."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
