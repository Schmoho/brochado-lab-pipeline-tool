{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The post-translational attachment of ubiquitin ([interpro:IPR000626]) to proteins (ubiquitinylation) alters the function, location or trafficking of a protein, or targets it to the 26S proteasome for degradation [[cite:PUB00015621], [cite:PUB00015619], [cite:PUB00015625]]. Ubiquitinylation is an ATP-dependent process that involves the action of at least three enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2, [interpro:IPR000608]), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3, [interpro:IPR000569], [interpro:IPR003613]), which work sequentially in a cascade [[cite:PUB00015620]]. The E1 enzyme is responsible for activating ubiquitin, the first step in ubiquitinylation. The E1 enzyme hydrolyses ATP and adenylates the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, and then links this residue to the active site cysteine of E1, yielding a ubiquitin-thioester and free AMP. To be fully active, E1 must non-covalently bind to and adenylate a second ubiquitin molecule. The E1 enzyme can then transfer the thioester-linked ubiquitin molecule to a cysteine residue on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2, in an ATP-dependent reaction.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7zh9", "name" "Uba1 in complex with ATP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042063", "name" "Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, SCCH domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038252", "name" "Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01408" "ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1", "short" "UBQ-activ_enz_E1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 50, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2515, "taxa" 8694, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7523, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7509, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4302}, "pathways" 75}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1754", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1754"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
