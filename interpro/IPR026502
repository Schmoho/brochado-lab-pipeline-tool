{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the histone stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP1) and the Xenopus Oocyte-specific histone RNA stem-loop-binding protein 2 (SLBP2). They both bind to the 3' end of histone mRNA in frog oocytes. However, their functions are different. SLBP1 participates in histone pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, while oocyte specific SLBP2 doesn't support the histone pre-mRNA processing and locates in the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00060527]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SLBP1 binds the 5' side of the stem-loop structure of replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs and contributes to efficient 3'-end processing by stabilising the complex between histone pre-mRNA and U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), via the histone downstream element (HDE) [[cite:PUB00060526]]. It plays an important role in targeting mature histone mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and to the translation machinery. It stabilises mature histone mRNA and could be involved in cell-cycle regulation of histone gene expression [[cite:PUB00060522], [cite:PUB00060523], [cite:PUB00060524], [cite:PUB00060525]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038294", "name" "SLBP, RNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17408" "HISTONE RNA HAIRPIN-BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone RNA stem-loop-binding protein SLBP1/SLBP2", "short" "SLBP1/SLBP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1178, "taxa" 4687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3168, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3168, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2270}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026502", :literature {"PUB00060522" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Arnold DR" "Francon P" "Zhang J" "Martin K" "Clarke HJ."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
