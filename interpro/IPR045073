{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of cytosolic GSTs, including Omega and Tau family members. Proteins in this family are known to catalyse the following reaction types: conjugate addition, dehydroascorbate reductase, disulfide bond reductase, nucleophilic addition, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, nucleophilic substitution (SN2), peroxidase, and thiolysis reactions. For example, protein sepia ([swissprot:Q9VSL3]) has experimentally-confirmed pyrimidodiazepine synthase activity with 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin, which is a reaction involved in eye pigment synthesis in Drosophila. Additionally, it has experimentally-confirmed dehydroascorbate reductase activity and disulfide bond reductase activity with beta-hydroxyethylene disulfide [[cite:PUB00097984], [cite:PUB00097983]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8a0r", "name" "Crystal structure of poplar glutathione transferase U20 in complex with pinocembrin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036282", "name" "Glutathione S-transferase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01152" "Main.3: Omega- and Tau-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR11260" "GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, GST, SUPERFAMILY, GST DOMAIN CONTAINING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutathione S-transferase Omega/Tau-like", "short" "Omega/Tau-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 65, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1107, "taxa" 5196, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17938, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17451, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10917}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
