{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Drosophila species specific Turandot proteins. The Turandot A (TotA) gene encodes a humoral factor, which is secreted from the fat body and accumulates in the body fluids. TotA is strongly induced upon bacterial challenge, as well as by other types of stress such as high temperature, mechanical pressure, dehydration, UV irradiation, and oxidative agents. It is also upregulated during metamorphosis and at high age. Flies that overexpress TotA show prolonged survival and retain normal activity at otherwise lethal temperatures. Although TotA is only induced by severe stress, it responds to a much wider range of stimuli than heat shock genes such as hsp70 or immune genes such as Cecropin A1 [[cite:PUB00013058], [cite:PUB00095647]]. This proteins are regulated by the JAK/STAT and Imd pathways and Mekk1 [[cite:PUB00095648]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07240" "Stress-inducible humoral factor Turandot"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stress-inducible humoral factor Turandot", "short" "Turandot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 110, "sets" 0, "proteins" 110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 94}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010825", :literature {"PUB00013058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Ekengren S" "Tryselius Y" "Dushay MS" "Liu G" "Steiner H" "Hultmark D."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
