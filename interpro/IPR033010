{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase that targets mitotic regulators for degradation in exit from mitosis. At the end of mitosis, APC/C is activated by phosphorylation and association with the WD-40 protein Cdc20/Fizzy [[cite:PUB00077383]]. The inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc20/Fizzy may have a role as a safeguard to keep the cyclosome inactive in early mitosis and under conditions of mitotic checkpoint arrest [[cite:PUB00077383]]. This entry includes Cdc20/Fizzy homologues from fungi, plants and animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three characterised budding yeasts homologues are included in this entry: Cdc20, Cdh1 and Ama1. Cdc20 and Cdh1 have been shown to activate APC/C during mitosis, while Ama1 is a meiosis-specific activator of the APC/C [[cite:PUB00077391]]. The APC/C-Cdh1 is also found involved in the cellular response to DNA damage [[cite:PUB00077392]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ggc", "name" "Structural Analysis of Human Cdc20 Supports Multi-site Degron Recognition by APC/C"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19918" "CELL DIVISION CYCLE 20 CDC20 FIZZY -RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat Cdc20/Fizzy", "short" "Cdc20/Fizzy"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2707, "taxa" 9303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14998, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14998, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9362}, "pathways" 120}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033010", :literature {"PUB00077383" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yudkovsky Y" "Shteinberg M" "Listovsky T" "Brandeis M" "Hershko A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
