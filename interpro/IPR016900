{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alg10 (asparagine-linked glycosylation) ([ec:2.4.1.256]) is a dolichyl-phosphoglucose-dependent glucosyltransferase which adds the terminal alpha-1,2 glucose to the lipid-linked Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide. The terminal alpha-1,2-linked glucose residue is important for substrate recognition by the oligosaccharyltransferase [[cite:PUB00019414]]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Alg10 has a role in regulation of the expression of a myo-inositol transporter, Itr1 (hence the name Die2, standing for derepression of Itr1 expression) [[cite:PUB00066987]]. It also regulates the expression of Ino1, which is an inositol-3-phosphate synthase [[cite:PUB00066987]]. Alg10 is homologous to human and rat potassium channel regulatory protein KCR1, which diminishes the cardiac repolarising current I(Kr) drug response [[cite:PUB00043473], [cite:PUB00008706]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04922" "DIE2/ALG10 family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF028810" "Alpha-1,2 glucosyltransferase Alg10"}, "panther" {"PTHR12989" "ALPHA-1,2-GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE ALG10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-2-glucosyltransferase Alg10", "short" "Alg10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 2420, "taxa" 8333, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4447, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4223, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2795}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
