{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Moricin is a antibacterial peptide that is highly basic. The structure of moricin reveals that it is comprised of a long α-helix. The N terminus of the helix is amphipathic, and the C terminus of the helix is predominately hydrophobic. The amphipathic N-terminal segment of the α-helix is mainly responsible for the increase in permeability of the bacterial membrane which kills the bacteria [[cite:PUB00012610]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037043", "name" "Moricin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06451" "Moricin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Moricin family", "short" "Moricin_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 97, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009456", :literature {"PUB00012610" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Hemmi H" "Ishibashi J" "Hara S" "Yamakawa M."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(02)02637-6", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Solution structure of moricin, an antibacterial peptide, isolated from the silkworm Bombyx mori.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "33-8", "volume" "518", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11997013}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042742", "name" "defense response to bacterium", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005576", "name" "extracellular region", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009456", "name" "Moricin family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 19}}}
