Substrate specificity is conferred by the regulatory particle (RP), which can dissociate into stable lid and base subcomplexes. The regulatory subunit RPN7 is one of the lid subunits of the 26S proteasome and has been shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be required for structural integrity [[cite:PUB00045323]].</p>\n\n<p>The COP9 signalosome is a conserved protein complex composed of eight subunits, where individual subunits of the complex have been linked to various signal transduction pathways leading to gene expression and cell cycle control [[cite:PUB00045324]]. The overall organisation and the amino acid sequences of the COP9 signalosome subunits resemble the lid subcomplex of the 19 S regulatory particle for the 26 S proteasome [[cite:PUB00034668]]. COP9 subunit 1 (CSN1 or GPS1) of the COP9 complex is an essential subunit of the complex with regard to both structural integrity and functionality. The N-terminal region of subunit 1 (CSN1-N) can inhibit c-fos expression from either a transfected template or a chromosomal transgene (fos-lacZ), and may contain the activity domain that confers most of the repression functions of CSN1. The C-terminal region of subunit 1 (CSN1-C) allows integration of the protein into the COP9 signalosome.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14145" "26S PROTESOME SUBUNIT 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "26S proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn7/COP9 signalosome complex subunit 1", "short" "Rpn7/CSN1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 107, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2724, "taxa" 11137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10755, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10755, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6573}, "pathways" 268}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019585", :literature {"PUB00045323" {"URL" nil, "issue" "26", "authors" ["Isono E" "Saeki Y" "Yokosawa H" "Toh-e A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
