{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme of lipid metabolism that hydrolyses triglycerides, providing free fatty acids for cells and affecting the maturation of circulating lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00005099]]. The enzyme is thought to play a role in the development of obesity and atherosclerosis [[cite:PUB00005099]]. Human LPL contains 448 amino acids; sequence comparison indicates that human LPL, hepatic lipase, and pancreatic lipase are members of a gene family [[cite:PUB00005099]]. Defects in LPL are a cause of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (or type I hyperlipoproteinemia) and also of a form of deficiency characterised by hypertriglyceridemia. Familial chylomicronemia is a recessive disorder usually manifesting in childhood. On a normal diet, patients often present with abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, eruptive xanthomata, and massive hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes complicated with acute pancreatitis. LPL and pancreatic lipase share ~30% sequence identity, suggesting a similar tertiary fold [[cite:PUB00002888]]. Molecular models of LPL have been constructed, based on X-ray crystal structures of pancreatic lipase [[cite:PUB00003189]]. These models allowed the authors to propose hypotheses on the structural determinants of LPL that are responsible for heparin binding, dimer formation, and phospholipase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03230" "lipoprotein lipase"}, "prints" {"PR00822" "LIPOLIPASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipoprotein lipase", "short" "Lipo_Lipase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 636, "taxa" 2251, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8501, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2680, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1740}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
