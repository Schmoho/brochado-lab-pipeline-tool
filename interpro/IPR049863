{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Ribonuclease HI from Halobacterium salinarum (known as RnhA) ([swissprot:Q9HSF6]) ([pdbe:4NYN]) and similar proteins specific to halobacteria species. RnhA is an enzymatic nuclease with a specific role in the degradation of RNA within RNA-DNA hybrids. Its mode of action suggests exonucleolytic activity in the context of RNA/DNA hybrids. Furthermore, RnhA exhibits endonucleolytic capabilities, playing a crucial role in the removal of RNA primers associated with the Okazaki fragments during the synthesis of the lagging strand [[cite:PUB00106310], [cite:PUB00153134]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4nyn", "name" "Crystal structure of RNase H1 from halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012337", "name" "Ribonuclease H-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036397", "name" "Ribonuclease H superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041306" "ribonuclease HI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease HI, halobacteria", "short" "RnhA-like_halobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 572, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 417, "sets" 0, "proteins" 417, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 366}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
