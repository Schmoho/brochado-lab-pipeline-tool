{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Integrator complex is involved in small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U1 and U2 transcription, and in their 3'-box-dependent processing. This complex associates with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II largest subunit and is recruited to the U1 and U2 snRNAs genes [[cite:PUB00045283]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents integrator complex subunit 3 (Ints3). It is also a component of the sensor of single-stranded DNA complex (SOSS), which associates with single-stranded DNA, important for DNA repair and efficient homologous recombination [[cite:PUB00098617]]. This subunit serves as a central adaptor for SOSS complex assembly and stability, and facilitates the accumulation of the complex to the sites of DNA damage. Its N-terminal region acts as a scaffold for SOSSB1 and SOSSC interaction and it is not essential for ssDNA binding [[cite:PUB00098617]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4owt", "name" "Structural basis of SOSS1 complex assembly"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13587" "INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Integrator complex subunit 3", "short" "INTS3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1299, "taxa" 5154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2893, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2893, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1692}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045334", :literature {"PUB00045283" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Baillat D" "Hakimi MA" "Naar AM" "Shilatifard A" "Cooch N" "Shiekhattar R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.019", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Integrator, a multiprotein mediator of small nuclear RNA processing, associates with the C-terminal repeat of RNA polymerase II.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "265-76", "volume" "123", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16239144}, "PUB00098617" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ren W" "Chen H" "Sun Q" "Tang X" "Lim SC" "Huang J" "Song H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Structural basis of SOSS1 complex assembly and recognition of ssDNA.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "982-991", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24630995}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045334", "name" "Integrator complex subunit 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
