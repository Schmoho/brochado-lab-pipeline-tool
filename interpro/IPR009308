{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial L-rhamnose isomerase proteins ([ec:5.3.1.14]). This enzyme interconverts L-rhamnose and L-rhamnulose. In some species, including Escherichia coli, this is the first step in rhamnose catabolism. Sequential steps are catalysed by rhamnulose kinase (rhaB), then rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (rhaD) to yield glycerone phosphate and (S)-lactaldehyde. Bifunctional enzyme RhaA/RhaB from Bacillus clausii is also included in this entry. It contains both rhamnulokinase and L-rhamnose isomerase domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1d8w", "name" "L-RHAMNOSE ISOMERASE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036237", "name" "Xylose isomerase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00541" "L-rhamnose isomerase [rhaA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01748" "L-rhamnose isomerase"}, "pfam" {"PF06134" "L-rhamnose isomerase (RhaA)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhamnose isomerase", "short" "Rhamnose_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 956, "taxa" 4670, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5182, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5178, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3843}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0457", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0457"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
