{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This domain family is found in eukaryotes, and is approximately 100 amino acids in length. The family is found in association with [pfam:PF10197]. There is a single completely conserved residue Y that may be functionally important. Cwc25 has been identified to associate with pre-mRNA splicing factor Cef1/Ntc85, a component of the Prp19-associated complex (NTC) involved in spliceosome activation. Cwc25 is neither tightly associated with NTC nor required for spliceosome activation, but is required for the first catalytic reaction.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12542" "Pre-mRNA splicing factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA splicing factor", "short" "CWC25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 63, "proteomes" 2394, "taxa" 8110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3779, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3775, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2436}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022209", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022209", "name" "Pre-mRNA splicing factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 107, "alignment:full" 2137}}}
