{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME B (SOB) five-Like (SOFL) family of novel plant-specific proteins which have high sequence similarity and similar protein structures [[cite:PUB00096755], [cite:PUB00096754]]. These proteins are involved in cytokinin-mediated development and contain two highly conserved domains SOFL-A and SOFL-B, which are necessary for their function [[cite:PUB00096754]]. These proteins are positive modulators of the endogenous content of specific cytokinin levels derived from the biosynthetic intermediates trans-zeatin riboside monophosphate (tZRMP) and N6-(Delta2-isopentenyl)adenosine monophosphate (iPRMP) such as N-glucosides trans-zeatin 7-glucoside (tZ7G), cis-zeatin 7-glucoside (cZ7G) and N6-(Delta2-isopentenyl)adenine 7-glucoside (iP7G) [[cite:PUB00096755], [cite:PUB00096754]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33347" "OSJNBA0091C07.3 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SOB-five-like", "short" "SOFL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1088, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2227, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2227, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1337}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044670", :literature {"PUB00096754" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Tayengwa R" "Zhao J" "Pierce CF" "Werner BE" "Neff MM."], "ISO_journal" "G3 (Bethesda)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "G3 (Bethesda)", "title" "Synopsis of the SOFL Plant-Specific Gene Family.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1281-1290", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29467189}, "PUB00096755" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zhang J" "Vankova R" "Malbeck J" "Dobrev PI" "Xu Y" "Chong K" "Neff MM."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "AtSOFL1 and AtSOFL2 act redundantly as positive modulators of the endogenous content of specific cytokinins in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e8236", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20011053}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009690", "name" "cytokinin metabolic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009691", "name" "cytokinin biosynthetic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044670", "name" "SOB-five-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
