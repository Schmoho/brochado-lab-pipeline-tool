{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit Trm82 and its homologues, wuho from flies and WDR4 from humans.</p>\n\n<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Trm82 is the non-catalytic subunit of the tRNA methyltransferase complex which consists of Trm8 and Trm82 [[cite:PUB00049689], [cite:PUB00057963]]. It is essential for the enzyme activity and may function in regulating the the Trm8 protein [[cite:PUB00049689]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, WDR4 forms the tRNA methyltransferase complex with METTL1 (Trm8 homologue). It is required to stabilise and induce conformational changes of the catalytic subunit METTL1 [[cite:PUB00017356]]. It is required for the formation of N7-methylguanine at position 46 (m7G46) in tRNA [[cite:PUB00017356], [cite:PUB00100516]] and also for the formation of N7-methylguanine at internal sites in a subset of mRNAs [[cite:PUB00100516]]. WDR4 is also involved in the methylation of a specific subset of miRNAs, such as let-7 [[cite:PUB00100514]]. Independently of METTL1, it also plays a role in genome stability: localizes at the DNA replication site and regulates endonucleolytic activities of FEN1 [[cite:PUB00100515]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8h0n", "name" "Crystal structure of the human METTL1-WDR4 complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03056" "tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit <gene_name> [WDR4]"}, "panther" {"PTHR16288" "WD40 REPEAT PROTEIN 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit", "short" "Trm82"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2548, "taxa" 8500, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4238, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4238, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2824}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028884", :literature {"PUB00100515" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cheng IC" "Chen BC" "Shuai HH" "Chien FC" "Chen P" "Hsieh TS."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Wuho Is a New Member in Maintaining Genome Stability through its Interaction with Flap Endonuclease 1.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1002349", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26751069}, "PUB00100516" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhang LS" "Liu C" "Ma H" "Dai Q" "Sun HL" "Luo G" "Zhang Z" "Zhang L" "Hu L" "Dong X" "He C."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Transcriptome-wide Mapping of Internal N<sup>7</sup>-Methylguanosine Methylome in Mammalian mRNA.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1304-1316.e8", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31031084}, "PUB00100514" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Pandolfini L" "Barbieri I" "Bannister AJ" "Hendrick A" "Andrews B" "Webster N" "Murat P" "Mach P" "Brandi R" "Robson SC" "Migliori V" "Alendar A" "d'Onofrio M" "Balasubramanian S" "Kouzarides T."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "METTL1 Promotes let-7 MicroRNA Processing via m7G Methylation.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1278-1290.e9", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31031083}, "PUB00057963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Matsumoto K" "Toyooka T" "Tomikawa C" "Ochi A" "Takano Y" "Takayanagi N" "Endo Y" "Hori H."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2007.03.023", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "RNA recognition mechanism of eukaryote tRNA (m7G46) methyltransferase (Trm8-Trm82 complex).", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1599-604", "volume" "581", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17382321}, "PUB00049689" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Leulliot N" "Chaillet M" "Durand D" "Ulryck N" "Blondeau K" "van Tilbeurgh H."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.10.025", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure of the yeast tRNA m7G methylation complex.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "52-61", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18184583}, "PUB00017356" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Alexandrov A" "Martzen MR" "Phizicky EM."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355838202024019", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Two proteins that form a complex are required for 7-methylguanosine modification of yeast tRNA.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1253-66", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12403464}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0036265", "name" "RNA (guanine-N7)-methylation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR028884", "name" "tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
