{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of transcriptional regulators. In mammals, TACO1 ([swissprot:Q9BSH4]) activates the transcription of mitochondrially-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX1). Defects in TACO1 are a cause of Leigh syndrome (LS). LS is a severe neurological disorder characterised by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in subcortical brain regions that is commonly associated with systemic cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency [[cite:PUB00057436]]. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a member of this family, PmpR, is involved in regulation of the quinolone signal (PQS) system and of pyocyanine production. It negatively regulates the quorum-sensing response regulator pqsR of the PQS system by binding to its promoter region [[cite:PUB00057437]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mw7", "name" "X-RAY STRUCTURE OF Y162_HELPY NORTHEAST STRUCTURAL GENOMICS CONSORTIUM TARGET PR6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029072", "name" "YebC-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR026564", "name" "Transcriptional regulator TACO1-like, domain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00693" "Probable transcriptional regulatory protein YebC [yebC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01033" "YebC/PmpR family DNA-binding transcriptional regulator"}, "panther" {"PTHR12532" "TRANSLATIONAL ACTIVATOR OF CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulator TACO1-like", "short" "Transcrip_reg_TACO1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11157, "taxa" 44064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 51070, "sets" 0, "proteins" 51070, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38923}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002876", :literature {"PUB00057436" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Weraarpachai W" "Antonicka H" "Sasarman F" "Seeger J" "Schrank B" "Kolesar JE" "Lochmuller H" "Chevrette M" "Kaufman BA" "Horvath R" "Shoubridge EA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
