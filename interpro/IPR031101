{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes budding yeast RNA polymerase-associated protein Ctr9 and its homologues from other yeasts, animals and plants. The homologue in fission yeast is known as tetratricopeptide repeat protein 1 (Tpr1) [[cite:PUB00074851]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budding yeast Ctr9 is part of the Paf1 complex, an RNA polymerase II-associated protein complex containing Paf1, Cdc73, Ctr9, Rtf1 and Leo1 [[cite:PUB00009800]]. Paf1 complex is involved in histone modifications, transcription elongation and other gene expression processes that include transcript site selection [[cite:PUB00074568]]. Human Paf1 complex (Paf1C) consists of Paf1, Cdc73, Ctr9, Rtf1, Leo1 and Wdr61 (Ski8). As in yeast, the human Paf1C has a central role in co-transcriptional histone modifications [[cite:PUB00074570]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arabidopsis Paf1C related proteins such as VIP4 (Leo1), VIP5 (Rtf1), ELF7 (Paf1), ELF8 (Ctr9) and ATXR7 (Set1) are required for the induction of seed dormancy. They control both germination and flowering time [[cite:PUB00074589]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14027" "RNA POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN CTR9"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase-associated protein Ctr9", "short" "Ctr9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2616, "taxa" 10198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6016, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6016, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3718}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031101", :literature {"PUB00074568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kim J" "Guermah M" "Roeder RG."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.12.050", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "The human PAF1 complex acts in chromatin transcription elongation both independently and cooperatively with SII/TFIIS.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "491-503", "volume" "140", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20178742}, "PUB00009800" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Mueller CL" "Jaehning JA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
