{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic dolichol phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory (DPM2) proteins. Biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol and N-glycan precursor is dependent upon a mannosyl donor, dolichol phosphate-mannose (DPM). DPM2, an 84 amino acid membrane protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), makes a complex with DPM1 that is essential for the ER localisation and stable expression of DPM1. Moreover, DPM2 enhances binding of dolichol phosphate, a substrate of DPM synthase. Biosynthesis of DPM in mammalian cells is regulated by DPM2 [[cite:PUB00013090]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15039" "DOLICHOL PHOSPHATE-MANNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS REGULATORY PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF07297" "Dolichol phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory protein (DPM2)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dolichol phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory", "short" "DPM2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 31, "proteomes" 1961, "taxa" 6531, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2901, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2889, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1897}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1455", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1455"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009914", :literature {"PUB00013090" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Maeda Y" "Tomita S" "Watanabe R" "Ohishi K" "Kinoshita T."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/17.17.4920", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "DPM2 regulates biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate-mannose in mammalian cells: correct subcellular localization and stabilization of DPM1, and binding of dolichol phosphate.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "4920-9", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9724629}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030234", "name" "enzyme regulator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0180047", "name" "dolichol phosphate mannose biosynthetic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005789", "name" "endoplasmic reticulum membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009914", "name" "Dolichol phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 37, "alignment:full" 1778}}}
