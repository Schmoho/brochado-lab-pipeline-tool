{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4HPA) 3-monooxygenase consists of two components, a large component, HpaB, which is an oxygenase, and a small component, HpaC, which is a reductase. 4-HPA 3-monooxygenase is NADH-dependent and uses FAD as the redox chromophore. HpaB utilises FADH2 supplied by HpaC to catalyse the hydroxylation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, leading to the production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPA) [[cite:PUB00050164]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the HpaB from Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00016840]] and similar proteins found in Gammaproteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6qyi", "name" "Structure of HPAB from E.coli in complex with FAD"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009100", "name" "Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase/oxidase, N-terminal and middle domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02310" "4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase, oxygenase component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase oxygenase component, gammaproteobacteria", "short" "HpaB_gammaproteobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 53, "taxa" 751, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 901, "sets" 0, "proteins" 901, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 717}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0231", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0231"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
