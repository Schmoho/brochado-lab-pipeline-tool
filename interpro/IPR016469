{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents carbohydrate sulphotransferase, which catalyses the transfer of a sulphate to position 6 of the galactose (Gal) residues in keratan. It may function in the sulphation of sialyl N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharide chains attached to glycoproteins and participate in the biosynthesis of selectin ligands. Selectin ligands are present in high endothelial cells (HEVs) and play a central role in lymphocyte homing at sites of inflammation. Carbohydrate sulphotransferase CHST1, CHST2, CHST3, and CHST4 are all involved in producing functional L-selectin ligands [[cite:PUB00044060]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deficiency of CHST3 (also known as chondroitin-6-sulphotransferase) has been associated with severe chondrodysplasia with progressive spinal involvement [[cite:PUB00044061]]. Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) has also been shown to be caused by mutations in the carbohydrate sulphotransferase 6 gene (CHST6) [[cite:PUB00044062]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005883" "Carbohydrate sulfotransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbohydrate sulfotransferase", "short" "Carbohydrate_sulfotransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 649, "taxa" 2174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3804, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3789, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2680}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
