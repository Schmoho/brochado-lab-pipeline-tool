{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Autoinducers are signal molecules involved in quorum sensing, the process of chemical communication that bacteria use to assess cell population density and synchronize behaviour. The molecule (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) is produced by many different species of bacteria and is the precursor of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variety of bacterial species have the ability to sequester and process the AI-2 present in their environment, thereby interfering with the cell-cell communication of other bacteria. This process involves the lsr operon, induced by AI-2. This operon consists of a transport system that facilitates uptake of the signal, a kinase that phosphorylates the signal to phospho-DPD (P-DPD), and enzymes that are responsible for processing the phosphorylated signal, thereby terminating induction of the lsr operon [[cite:PUB00056209]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>One of the enzymes responsible for processing the phosphorylated signal is LsrF.
