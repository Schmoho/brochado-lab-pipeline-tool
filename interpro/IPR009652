{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Programmed cell death 10 protein (PDCD10/CCM3) is part of the CCM complex and is required for neuronal migration [[cite:PUB00076417]]. It also has roles outside of this complex [[cite:PUB00076419]], it is crucial in vascularization and in angiogenesis as it functions in vessel permeability and stability [[cite:PUB00096889]]. PDCD10/CCM3 was originally discovered to be upregulated during granulocyte apoptosis and is thought to play a role in cell death [[cite:PUB00076419]]. However, a specific role for PDCD10 in cell survival is not clear as both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic effects have been reported [[cite:PUB00096889], [cite:PUB00076418]]. PDCD10/CCM3 contains an N-terminal dimerisation domain and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting-homology (FAT-H) domain [[cite:PUB00076418]].</p>\n\n<p>There are three CCM proteins: CCM1 (also known as KRIT1), CCM2 (also known as OSM and malcavernin) and CCM3 (also known as PDCD10). Mutations in the genes encoding CCM proteins cause cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), a disease characterised by dilated leaky blood vessels, especially in the neurovasculature, that result in increased risk of stroke, focal neurological defects and seizures. The CCM proteins can form a trimeric complex. They can also interact with a range of signaling, cytoskeletal and adaptor proteins that may account for their roles in a range of basic cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration, polarity and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00076418]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4geh", "name" "Crystal structure of MST4 dimerization domain complex with PDCD10"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053750", "name" "Programmed Cell Death 10 Homolog", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13250" "TF-1 CELL APOPTOSIS RELATED PROTEIN-15"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Programmed cell death protein 10", "short" "PDCD10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 966, "taxa" 3935, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1964, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1964, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1320}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009652", :literature {"PUB00076419" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wang Y" "Liu H" "Zhang Y" "Ma D."], "ISO_journal" "Sci.
