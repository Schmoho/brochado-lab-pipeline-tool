{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of GDSL lipases from Mycobacteriaceae, including Rv0518 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rv0518 catalyses the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl (pNP) esters, being pNP-decanoate (C10) the preferred substrate. It can also use pNP-octanoate (C8), pNP-dodecanoate (C12) and pNP-tetradecanoate (C14). It has lower activity with pNP-butyrate (C4), pNP-palmitate (C16) and pNP-stearate (C18) [[cite31125644]]. It does not have phospholipase A1 activity [[cite:PUB00154697]]. Rv0518 might help bacteria to utilize available lipids for its growth as well as provide resistance to various intracellular stresses by cell wall modulation resulting in enhanced intracellular survival [[cite:PUB00154697]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036514", "name" "SGNH hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045548" "Rv0518 family GDSL lipase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDSL lipase Rv0518", "short" "GDSL_Rv0518"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 71, "taxa" 353, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 374, "sets" 0, "proteins" 374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 312}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
