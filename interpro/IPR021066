{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents fungal proteinase inhibitors found mainly in arthropodes, including fungal protease inhibitor-1 (FPI-1) from Antheraea mylitta (Tasar silkworm). FPI1 inhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin proteases from the fungi Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae. However, they do not inhibit papain-like proteases from the bacterium  Bacillus licheniformis [[cite:PUB00053324]]. The crystal structure of this protein was solved using the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS), which revealed that it is a single domain protein possessing a unique fold that consists of three helices and five Î²-strands stabilized by a network of six disulfide bonds [[cite:PUB00099800]]. Members of this family belong to MEROPS inhibitor family I83, clan JH.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053741", "name" "Serine and fungal protease inhibitor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12190" "Fungal protease inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fungal protease inhibitor-1", "short" "FPI1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 48, "taxa" 357, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021066", :literature {"PUB00053324" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Shrivastava B" "Ghosh AK."], "ISO_journal" "Insect Biochem.
