In plants bZIPs regulate processes including pathogen defence, light and stress signalling, seed maturation and flower development  [[cite:PUB00019236]]. The bZIP domain consists of a basic DNA-binding region and the adjacent ZIP domain. The ZIP domain consists of heptad repeats of leucine (L) or related hydrophobic amino acids. The DNA-binding region is a basic region of ~16 amino acid residues containing a nuclear localization signal followed by an invariant N-x7-R/K motif that contacts the DNA \nThe heptad repeat of leucines or other bulky hydrophobic amino acids positioned exactly nine amino acids towards the C terminus, creating an amphipathic helix. To bind DNA, two subunits adhere via interactions between the hydrophobic sides of their helices, which creates a superimposing coiled-coil structure. The ability to form homo- and heterodimers is influenced by the electrostatic attraction and repulsion of polar residues flanking the hydrophobic interaction surface of the helices [[cite:PUB00019236]]. As bZIPs generally perform as dimers, heterodimerisation results in an enormous regulatory flexibility [[cite:PUB00094042]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46324" "BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 43-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Basic leucine zipper 8/43", "short" "AtbZIP8/43"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 257, "taxa" 1051, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1859, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1859, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1118}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044521", :literature {"PUB00094042" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt A", "authors" ["Droge-Laser W" "Snoek BL" "Snel B" "Weiste C."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
