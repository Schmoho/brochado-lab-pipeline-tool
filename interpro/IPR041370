{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a protein of approximately 200 residues which is conserved from plants to humans [[cite:PUB00001857]].  It contains a highly conserved QFW motif close to the N terminus and a DPPF motif in the centre. The DPPF motif is characteristic of N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylases, and this family is found in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00054136]]. Proteins in this entry include EEF1A lysine methyltransferase 1 (EEF1AKMT1) and ZCCHC4. EEF1AKMT1 is a protein-lysine methyltransferase that selectively catalyzes the trimethylation of EEF1A at 'Lys-79' [[cite:PUB00085186]]. ZCCHC4 is an rRNA N6-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the adenine in position 4220 of 28S rRNA [[cite:PUB00092431]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10237" "Probable N6-adenine methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyltransferase EEF1AKMT1/ZCCHC4", "short" "Mlase_EEF1AKMT1/ZCCHC4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 108, "proteomes" 2118, "taxa" 7633, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5188, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3394}, "pathways" 153}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
