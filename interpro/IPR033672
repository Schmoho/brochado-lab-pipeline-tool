{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Autoinducers are signal molecules involved in quorum sensing, the process of chemical communication that bacteria use to assess cell population density and synchronize behaviour. The molecule (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) is produced by many different species of bacteria and is the precursor of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variety of bacterial species have the ability to sequester and process the AI-2 present in their environment, thereby interfering with the cell-cell communication of other bacteria. This process involves the lsr operon, induced by AI-2. This operon consists of a transport system that facilitates uptake of the signal, a kinase that phosphorylates the signal to phospho-DPD (P-DPD), and enzymes that are responsible for processing the phosphorylated signal, thereby terminating induction of the lsr operon [[cite:PUB00056209]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>LsrG catalyzes the conversion of (4S)-4-hydroxy-5-phosphonooxypentane-2,3-dione (P-DPD) to 3-hydroxy-5-phosphonooxypentane-2,4-dione (P-HPD) [[cite:PUB00058992]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3qmq", "name" "Crystal Structure of E. coli LsrG"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02051" "(4S)-4-hydroxy-5-phosphonooxypentane-2,3-dione isomerase [lsrG]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "(4S)-4-hydroxy-5-phosphonooxypentane-2,3-dione isomerase", "short" "LsrG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 47, "taxa" 698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 791, "sets" 0, "proteins" 791, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 625}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
