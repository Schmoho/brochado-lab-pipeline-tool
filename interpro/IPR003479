{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The major capsid protein of the adenovirus strain is also known as a hexon. This entry represents protein IIIa, which is a hexon-associated protein that is likely to participate in vertex stabilisation and genome packaging. It stabilises vertices by tethering the penton bases to neighbouring peripentonal hexons, and lashes peripentonal hexons to the neighbouring hexons through its interaction with hexon-linking protein. During virus assembly, it seems to play a role in packaging of viral DNA via its interaction with packaging protein 3 [[cite:PUB00076672], [cite:PUB00076673]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043053", "name" "Pre-hexon-linking protein IIIa, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02455" "Hexon-associated protein (IIIa)"}, "hamap" {"MF_04047" "Pre-hexon-linking protein IIIa"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-hexon-linking protein IIIa", "short" "Hex_IIIa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 79, "taxa" 354, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 490, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003479", :literature {"PUB00076672" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Ma HC" "Hearing P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
