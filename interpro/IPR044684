{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of rhodanese-like domain-containing proteins from bacteria, archaea and plants, including STR17/STR18/HARC1 from Arabidopsis. HARC1 is an arsenate reductase that reduces arsenate to arsenite in the root, facilitating efflux of arsenic back into the soil to limit both its accumulation in the root and transport to the shoot [[cite:PUB00096793]]. STR17/STR18 are sulfurtransferases [[cite:PUB00096795]]. STR18 catalyses the transfer of a sulfur ion from a donor to cyanide or to other thiol compounds [[cite:PUB00096794]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036873", "name" "Rhodanese-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44542" "THIOSULFATE SULFURTRANSFERASE 18"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhodanese-like domain-containing protein STR17/STR18/HARC1-like", "short" "STR17/STR18/HARC1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 318, "taxa" 1626, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1537, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1537, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1013}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
