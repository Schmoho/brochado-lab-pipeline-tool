{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Rabphilin and Doc2. Rabphilin and Doc2s share highly homologous tandem C2 domains, although their N-terminal structures are completely different: Rabphilin contains an N-terminal Rab-binding domain (RBD), whereas Doc2 contains an N-terminal Munc13-1-interacting domain (MID) [[cite:PUB00005039]]. This entry also includes Noc2 (also known as Rabphilin-3A-like protein), which is a potential effector of Ras-associated binding proteins Rab3A and Rab27A. Noc2 contains an N-terminal Rab3A effector domain which harbors a conserved zinc finger, but lacks tandem C2 domains [[cite:PUB00073141]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ns0", "name" "The C2A domain of Rabphilin 3A in complex with PI(4,5)P2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45729" "RABPHILIN, ISOFORM A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rabphilin/Doc2/Noc2", "short" "Rabphilin/DOC2/Noc2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 900, "taxa" 3607, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5437, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5437, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3258}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043566", :literature {"PUB00073141" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Manabe S" "Nishimura N" "Yamamoto Y" "Kitamura H" "Morimoto S" "Imai M" "Nagahiro S" "Seino S" "Sasaki T."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
