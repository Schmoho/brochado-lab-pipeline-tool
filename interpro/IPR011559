{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family describes part of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B superfamily. It includes eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B) subunits 1 and 2 (alpha and beta) and related proteins. Members of this branch of the family are predominantly uncharacterised with respect to function and are found in the archaea, bacteria, and eukarya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, one of these proteins from Bacillus subtilis has been functionally characterised as a 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase (MTNA, [ec:5.3.1.23], [[cite:PUB00016716]]). This enzyme participates in the methionine salvage pathway catalysing the isomerisation of 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate to 5-methylthio ribulose-1-phosphate [[cite:PUB00016714]]. The methionine salvage pathway leads to the synthesis of methionine from methylthioadenosine, the end product of the spermidine and spermine anabolism in many species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1w2w", "name" "Crystal structure of yeast Ypr118w, a methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase related to regulatory eIF2B subunits"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037171", "name" "NagB/RpiA transferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027363", "name" "Methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042529", "name" "Initiation factor 2B-like, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00524" "S-methyl-5-thioribose-1-phosphate isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Initiation factor 2B alpha/beta/delta", "short" "Initiation_fac_2B_a/b/d"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5567, "taxa" 24153, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24822, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24818, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18229}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
