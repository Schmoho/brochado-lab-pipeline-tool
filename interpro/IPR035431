{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lysosome-related organelles comprise a group of specialised intracellular compartments that include melanosomes and platelet dense granules in mammals and eye pigment granules in insects. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a disorder of lysosome-related organelle biogenesis. Genes associated with HPS encode subunits of three complexes that are known as biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC)-1, -2 and -3 [[cite:PUB00043620]]. There are eight known HPS proteins of the BLOCs [[cite:PUB00043621], [cite:PUB00101254]]]. Organelles affected in HPS include the melanosome, resulting in hypopigmentation, and the platelet delta (dense) granule, resulting in prolonged bleeding times.</p>\n\n<p>HPS in humans or mice is caused by mutations in any of 15 genes, five of which encode subunits BLOC-1. BLOC-1 and BLOC-2 act sequentially in the same pathway. Melanosome maturation requires at least two cargo transport pathways directly from early endosomes to melanosomes. One pathway mediated by AP-3, and one pathway mediated by BLOC-1 and BLOC-2 [[cite:PUB00043622]]. The adaptor protein AP-3 complex is a component of the cellular machinery that controls protein sorting from endosomes to lysosomes and melanosomes. BLOC-1 interacts physically and functionally with AP-3 to facilitate the trafficking of a known AP-3 cargo, CD63, and of tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1). BLOC-1 also interacts with BLOC-2 to facilitate Tyrp1 trafficking by a mechanism apparently independent of AP-3 function. Both BLOC-1 and -2 predominantly localise to early endosome-associated tubules [[cite:PUB00043623]].</p>\n\n<p>Complex-2 (BLOC-2) contains the HPS3, HPS5 and HPS6 proteins as subunits. Fibroblasts deficient in the BLOC-2 subunits HPS3 or HPS6 have normal basal secretion function of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase [[cite:PUB00043624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes HPS5 homologues from insects.
