{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes nucleotidyltransferases that use nuclear RNA as substrate, such as Trf4 (also known as Poly(A) RNA polymerase protein 2, PAP2) from S. cerevisiae and its homologues Terminal nucleotidyltransferase 4A/B from humans (TENT4A and TENTB, also known as PAPD7/TRF4-1 and PAPD5/TRF4-2, respectively), Poly(A) RNA polymerase protein 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (TRF5), and Poly(A) RNA polymerase cid12 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Cid12 or PAP). These proteins function as subunits of the TRAMP-like complexes, which have a poly(A) RNA polymerase activity and are involved in a post-transcriptional quality control mechanism limiting inappropriate expression of genetic information [[cite:PUB00099139], [cite:PUB00099140], [cite:PUB00099138], [cite:PUB00074528]].</p>\n\n<p>TRF4 from humans catalyses preferentially the transfer of ATP and GTP on RNA 3' poly(A) tail creating a heterogeneous 3' poly(A) tail leading to mRNAs stabilization by protecting mRNAs from active deadenylation [[cite:PUB00090570], [cite:PUB00090574]].</p>\n\n<p>In S. cerevisiae, TRF5 polyadenylates RNA processing and degradation intermediates of snRNAs, snoRNAs and mRNAs that accumulate in strains lacking a functional exosome. TRF5 is also required for proper nuclear division in mitosis and sister chromatid cohesion. It is involved in the regulation of histone mRNA levels [[cite:PUB00099143], [cite:PUB00099142], [cite:PUB00099141]].</p>\n\n<p>Cid12 from S. pombe, has a role in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway which is important for heterochromatin formation and accurate chromosome segregation. It is a member of the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) which is involved in the generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and mediate their association with the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex [[cite:PUB00045061]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23092" "POLY(A) RNA POLYMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleotidyltransferase Trf4-like", "short" "Trf4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2649, "taxa" 9047, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9075, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9075, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5469}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
