{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a trifunctional tryptophan biosynthesis protein found in some yeast. In Neurospora crassa the anthranilate synthase complex catalyses the first, third and fourth enzymatic reactions of the committed pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis. This heterotetrameric complex (alpa2/beta2) is composed of a monofunctional alpha-subunit or component I (the trp-2 gene product), which catalyses the formation of anthranilate using ammonia rather than glutamine, and a beta-subunit or component II (the trp-1 gene product), which is a trifunctional polypeptide bearing the glutamine amidotransferase (TrpG), indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase (TrpC), and phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (TrpF) activities [[cite:PUB00027742], [cite:PUB00073186]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001382" "Fungal anthranilate synthase, component II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anthranilate synthase component 2", "short" "Anthranilate_synth_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 906, "taxa" 2384, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1295, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1257, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 772}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
