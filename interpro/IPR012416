{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60 (CBP60) family from plants have been known to be involved in both biotic and abiotic stress responses [[cite:PUB00074920]]. Some members (for example, [swissprot:Q8H6T7]), are known to be involved in the induction of plant defence responses [[cite:PUB00016592]]. In Arabidopsis, CBP60s have eight members, including CBP60g and SARD1, which encode positive regulators of plant immunity that promote production of salicylic acid (SA) and affect expression of SA-dependent and SA-independent defense genes [[cite:PUB00074919], [cite:PUB00074918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31713" "OS02G0177800 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60", "short" "CBP60"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 281, "taxa" 1090, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6033, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6033, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3614}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012416", :literature {"PUB00016592" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ali GS" "Reddy VS" "Lindgren PB" "Jakobek JL" "Reddy AS."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
