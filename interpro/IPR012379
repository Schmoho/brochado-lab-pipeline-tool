{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group combine the LytTR DNA-binding transcriptional regulator domain [[cite:PUB00009981]] with an N-terminal membrane-bound MHYE domain that consists of three predicted transmembrane segments with conserved Glu, Asp, His and Tyr residues. The membrane topology of this domain is somewhat similar to that of MHYT domain [[cite:PUB00016193]], suggesting that it, too, might be membrane-bound and metal-binding [[cite:PUB00009981]].</p>\r\n<p>A member of this group is RpfD from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. Although the<i>rpfD</i>gene is located in the<i>rpf</i>(regulation of pathogenicity factors) locus of X. campestris, mutants with transposon insertion in the<i>rpfD</i>gene did not exhibit any discernible phenotype [[cite:PUB00015987]].
