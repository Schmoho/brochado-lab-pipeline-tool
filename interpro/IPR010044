{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP).  MTAP catalyses the reversible phosphorylation of S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA) to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate. It is involved in the breakdown of MTA, a major by-product of polyamine biosynthesis. It is responsible for the first step in the methionine salvage pathway after MTA has been generated from S-adenosylmethionine. It has broad substrate specificity with 6-aminopurine nucleosides as preferred substrates [[cite:PUB00060784], [cite:PUB00060785]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2a8y", "name" "Crystal structure of 5'-deoxy-5'methylthioadenosine phosphorylase complexed with 5'-deoxy-5'methylthioadenosine and sulfate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09010" "5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylases (MTAP) similar to Sulfolobus solfataricus MTAPII and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 5'-methylthioinosine phosphorylase (MTIP)"}, "hamap" {"MF_01963" "S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase [mtnP]"}, "panther" {"PTHR42679" "S-METHYL-5'-THIOADENOSINE PHOSPHORYLASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01694" "S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)", "short" "MTAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5901, "taxa" 23089, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23801, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23793, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17663}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0729", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0729"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
