Conversely, microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides to beta subunit mRNA produces decreased calcium currents and shifts voltage-dependent activation to more positive membrane potentials.  There are four distinct beta subunits: beta-1, beta-2, beta-3 and beta-4; and the magnitude of the shift in the voltage-dependence of activation of change to membrane potentials varies with the particular subtype [[cite:PUB00007090]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Ca2+ ions are unique in that they not only carry charge but they are also the most widely used of diffusible second messengers. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) are a family of molecules that allow cells to couple electrical activity to intracellular Ca2+ signalling. The opening and closing of these channels by depolarizing stimuli, such as action potentials, allows Ca2+ ions to enter neurons down a steep electrochemical gradient, producing transient intracellular Ca2+ signals. Many of the processes that occur in neurons, including transmitter release, gene transcription and metabolism are controlled by Ca2+ influx occurring simultaneously at different cellular locales. The pore is formed by the alpha-1 subunit which incorporates the conduction pore, the voltage sensor and gating apparatus, and the known sites of channel regulation by second messengers, drugs, and toxins [[cite:PUB00036034]]. The activity of this pore is modulated by four tightly-coupled subunits: an intracellular beta subunit; a transmembrane gamma subunit; and a disulphide-linked complex of alpha-2 and delta subunits, which are proteolytically cleaved from the same gene product. Properties of the protein including gating voltage-dependence, G protein modulation and kinase susceptibility can be influenced by these subunits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voltage-gated calcium channels are classified as T, L, N, P, Q and R, and are distinguished by their sensitivity to pharmacological blocks, single-channel conductance kinetics, and voltage-dependence. On the basis of their voltage activation properties, the voltage-gated calcium classes can be further divided into two broad groups: the low (T-type) and high (L, N, P, Q and R-type)                threshold-activated channels.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1t0h", "name" "Crystal structure of the Rattus norvegicus voltage gated calcium channel beta subunit isoform 2a"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01626" "LCACHANNELB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Voltage-dependent calcium channel, L-type, beta subunit", "short" "VDCC_L_bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 50, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1005, "taxa" 3984, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 85359, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10256, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6259}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000584", :literature {"PUB00007090" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Pichler M" "Cassidy TN" "Reimer D" "Haase H" "Kraus R" "Ostler D" "Striessnig J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
