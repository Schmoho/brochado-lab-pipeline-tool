{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MpaA is a murein-tripeptide-specific zinc carboxypeptidase that hydrolyses the gamma-D-glutamyl-diaminopimelic acid bond in the murein tripeptide (L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-meso-Dap), derived from the turnover of murein but it is not active against the murein tetrapeptide (L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-meso-Dap-D-Ala). MpaA is a dimeric metalloprotein, containing one zinc ion per chain. Crystal structure studies revealed that this protein has high structural similarity to eukaryotic zinc carboxypeptidases and that it has a narrower substrate specificity due to an additional structure that partially occludes the substrate-binding groove [[cite:PUB00094464]]. MpaA belongs to the peptidase M14 family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02211" "Murein peptide amidase A [mpaA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Murein peptide amidase A", "short" "MpaA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 93, "taxa" 1042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1274, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1274, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 962}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
