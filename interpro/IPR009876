{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents OpcA-type outer membrane adhesion proteins. OpcA (formerly called 5C) was isolated from Neisseria meningitidis, causative agent of meningococcal meningitis and septicemia. An outer membrane protein embedded in the lipid bilayer, OpcA was shown to play an important role in meningococcal adhesion and invasion of both epithelial and endothelial cells, mediating attachment to host cells by binding proteoglycan cell-surface receptors [[cite:PUB00013057]]. OpcA forms a 10-stranded Î²-barrel with five highly mobile extracellular loops that protrude above the surface of the membrane [[cite:PUB00028792]]. These extracellular loops combine to form a crevice in the external surface that is lined by positively charged residues, which is predicted to be a binding site for proteoglycan polysaccharides involved in pathogenesis. Conformational changes in the extracellular loops modulate the surface of OpcA, which could affect the proteoglycan binding site [[cite:PUB00035658]]. These conformational changes could also lead to pore opening.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vdf", "name" "Structure of the OpcA adhesion from Neisseria meningitidis determined by crystallization from the cubic mesophase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR020080", "name" "Outer membrane adhesin/peptidase omptin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07239" "Outer membrane protein OpcA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Outer membrane adhesin OpcA", "short" "OM_adhesin_OpcA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 82, "sets" 0, "proteins" 82, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 68}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009876", :literature {"PUB00028792" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Prince SM" "Achtman M" "Derrick JP."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
