{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the subunit 5 of the BLOC-1-related complex, which is also found in the BORC complex.  BLOC-1 is important for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, and BORC is important for the positioning of the lysosome in the cytoplasm.  The BORC complex associates with the lysosomal membrane where it recruits the small GTPase Arl8, which leads in turn to the kinesin-dependent movement of lysosomes toward the plus ends of microtubules in the peripheral cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00082308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31634" "BLOC-1-RELATED COMPLEX SUBUNIT 5"}, "pfam" {"PF10158" "Tumour suppressor protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BLOC-1-related complex subunit 5", "short" "TBORCS5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 994, "taxa" 3987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1746, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1719, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1189}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018780", :literature {"PUB00082308" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pu J" "Schindler C" "Jia R" "Jarnik M" "Backlund P" "Bonifacino JS."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
