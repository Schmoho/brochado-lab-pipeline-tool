{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry have an N-terminal FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase domain followed by a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat-containing domain.  Included in this entry are: aryl-hydrocarbon-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1), which is associated with inherited blindness and interacts with cell cycle regulator protein NUB1 [[cite:PUB00089922]]; and AH receptor-interacting protein (AIP), which interacts with the tyrosine kinase receptor RET [[cite:PUB00089923]], and mutations in AIP are associated with familial isolated pituitary adenomas [[cite:PUB00089924]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also matches Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 9 (TTC9). TTC9 contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains constituted of the 34 amino acid consensus motif present in various number of tandem repeats [[cite:PUB00101448]].
