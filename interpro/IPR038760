{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents photosystem II core complex protein psbY from plants. In higher plants, two related PsbY proteins exist, PsbY-1 and PsbY-2, which appear to function as a heterodimer. In spinach and Arabidopsis, these two proteins arise from a single-copy nuclear gene that is processed in the chloroplast. PsbY has two low manganese-dependent activities: a catalase-like activity and an L-arginine metabolising activity that converts L-arginine into ornithine and urea [[cite:PUB00012313]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34790" "PHOTOSYSTEM II CORE COMPLEX PROTEINS PSBY, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem II PsbY, plant", "short" "PsbY_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 253, "taxa" 1099, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 651, "sets" 0, "proteins" 651, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 396}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038760", :literature {"PUB00012313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gau AE" "Thole HH" "Sokolenko A" "Altschmied L" "Hermann RG" "Pistorius EK."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
