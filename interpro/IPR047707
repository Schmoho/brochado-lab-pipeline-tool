{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial enzymes that are involved in non-oxidative decarboxylation and detoxification of phenolic derivatives both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, such as Protein VdcD from Streptomyces sp.

It is not known if VdcD form a hetero-complex composed of VdcB, VdcC and VdcD. The term subunit here is used to refer to the operon, however, currently there is no experimental evidence for the existence of the complex [[cite:PUB00077007]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041205" "non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases subunit D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phenolic acid decarboxylase VdcD-like", "short" "VdcD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 172, "taxa" 1346, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1209, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1209, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 900}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047707", :literature {"PUB00077007" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lupa B" "Lyon D" "Gibbs MD" "Reeves RA" "Wiegel J."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2005.05.002", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "342-51", "volume" "86", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15979273}, "PUB00151025" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang X" "Wiegel J."], "ISO_journal" "Microb Ecol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microb Ecol", "title" "Isolation and partial characterization of aClostridium species transforming para-hydroxybenzoate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and producing phenols as the final transformation products.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "103-21", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24193968}, "PUB00106244" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Chow KT" "Pope MK" "Davies J."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Characterization of a vanillic acid non-oxidative decarboxylation gene cluster from Streptomyces sp.
