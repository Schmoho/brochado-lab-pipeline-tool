{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents toxin PezT, found mainly in lactobacillales. PezT is the toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system in which PezA is the cognate antitoxin. In this system, PezA functions as a transcriptional repressor with PezT as a corepressor. PezT interacts with PezA and forms a tight complex.</p>\n\n<p>PezAT TA system is a PezA2PezT2 heterotetramer, which has a dumbbell-shaped arrangement with an internal 2-fold symmetry [[cite:PUB00048622]]. The PezAT core is formed by a stack of two PezA antitoxin polypeptide chains that are sandwiched between two PezT toxin molecules whose dyad axis lies parallel to the PezA homodimer interface ([pdbe:2P5T]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041574" "type II toxin-antitoxin system toxin PezT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin PezT", "short" "PezT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 286, "sets" 0, "proteins" 286, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 231}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
