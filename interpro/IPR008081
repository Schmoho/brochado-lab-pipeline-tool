{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes cytoplasmic fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1-interacting proteins from humans and their homologues, such as Sra-1 (specifically Rac1-associated protein 1) from Drosophila and PIROGI from Arabidopsis.</p>\n\n<p>In humans, there are two members, CYFIP1 and CYFIP2. They both interact with FMRP (Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1), which is responsible for pathologic manifestations in the Fragile X Syndrome. CYFIP1 interacts with the small GTPase Rac1 [[cite:PUB00085142], [cite:PUB00011944]]. CYFIP1 represses cap-dependent translation of mRNA by interacting with the initiation factor eIF4E [[cite:PUB00085146]]. CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 are part of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) complex that regulates actin polymerization at synapses [[cite:PUB00085145]].</p>\n\n<p>Drosophila Sra-1 interacts with the Kette and Wasp. It is required for neuronal and bristle development in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00085143]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12195" "CYTOPLASMIC FMR1-INTERACTING PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF05994" "Cytoplasmic Fragile-X interacting family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF008153" "Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein"}, "prints" {"PR01698" "CYTOFMRPINTP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting", "short" "Cytoplasmic_FMR1-int"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 101, "proteomes" 1337, "taxa" 5302, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6740, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5382, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2865}, "pathways" 41}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008081", :literature {"PUB00085142" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Nebel RA" "Zhao D" "Pedrosa E" "Kirschen J" "Lachman HM" "Zheng D" "Abrahams BS."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0148039", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Reduced CYFIP1 in Human Neural Progenitors Results in Dysregulation of Schizophrenia and Epilepsy Gene Networks.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0148039", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26824476}, "PUB00011944" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Schenck A" "Bardoni B" "Moro A" "Bagni C" "Mandel JL."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
