{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of leucine rich adaptor proteins, including LURAP1 (LRAP35A), LURAP1L and LRAP25.

LRA25 also serves as an adaptor protein of MRCK (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase) [[cite:PUB00089725]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14854" "Leucine rich adaptor protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leucine rich adaptor protein 1/25", "short" "LURA1/LRA25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 776, "taxa" 3036, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2160, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2153, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1455}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039499", :literature {"PUB00086962" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Jing Z" "Yuan X" "Zhang J" "Huang X" "Zhang Z" "Liu J" "Zhang M" "Oyang J" "Zhang Y" "Zhang Z" "Yang R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
