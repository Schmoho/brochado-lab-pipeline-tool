More than 100 species of\nherpesviruses are classified into three subfamilies, namely alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses/herpesvirinae. Like other enveloped viruses, herpesviruses enter cells by fusing their lipid envelopes with a host cell membrane, either the plasma membrane or the membrane of an endocytic vesicle/endosome after internalisation, which releases the viral capsid and associated proteins into the host cytoplasm. Entry of enveloped viruses into a target cell proceeds through a sequence of events that begins with the binding of a viral receptor-binding glycoprotein to a cognate host cell receptor and culminates with membrane fusion by a viral fusogen, a glycoprotein that undergoes large conformational changes to bring apposing membranes into proximity until they fuse.</p>\n\n<p>Uniquely, herpesviruses distribute the functions of receptor engagement and membrane fusion across a diverse cast of glycoproteins. Two glycoprotein complexes are conserved throughout the three herpesvirus subfamilies: the trimeric glycoprotein B (gB) that functions as a membrane fusogen and the heterodimeric glycoprotein H/glycoprotein L (gH/gL), the role of which is less clearly defined. The intrinsic structural plasticity of gH/gL enables it to function as a signal integration machine that can accept diverse regulatory inputs and convert them into a \"trigger\" signal that activates the fusogenic ability of gB [[cite:PUB00153292], [cite:PUB00153293], [cite:PUB00055326], [cite:PUB00153294]].</p>\n\n<p>gH is a ~90kDa glycoprotein with a large ectodomain, a single-spanning transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Correct folding, trafficking to the cell surface, and function require that gH bind to gL, a soluble, ~25kDa glycoprotein. gH/gL is a central player in herpesvirus entry. Across all subfamilies, gH/gL connects binding of host cell receptors with membrane fusion. In alpha- and betaherpesviruses, gH/gL binds receptor-binding accessory proteins. In gammaherpesviruses, gH/gL either binds a receptor-binding accessory protein or directly engages the host cell receptor.\nIn all cases, gH/gL interacts with gB, presumably, relaying the \"trigger\" signal that leads to the conformational rearrangements that effect membrane fusion [[cite:PUB00153292], [cite:PUB00153293], [cite:PUB00055326], [cite:PUB00153294]].</p>\n\n<p>The sequences of the gL domain vary substantially among herpesviruses. For example, gL domains from alphaherpesviruses cannot be aligned at all with those from either beta- or gammaherpesviruses. The herpesvirus gL domain does not have a stable core. It includes three helices and two beta sheets. One four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet forms a six-stranded β-sheet with two strands from gH. Another is a short three-stranded mixed  β-sheet. Four cysteines in gL form two disulfide bonds, and all are critical for proper processing and activity of gH/gL. In the structure, the disulfides clearly maintain the proper fold of gL [[cite:PUB00055326], [cite:PUB00153294]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04036" "Envelope glycoprotein L [gL]"}, "pfam" {"PF01801" "Cytomegalovirus glycoprotein L"}, "profile" {"PS52025" "Betaherpesvirus glycoprotein L (gL) domain profile"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytomegalovirus glycoprotein L", "short" "Cytomegalo_gL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 24, "taxa" 137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 174, "sets" 0, "proteins" 174, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002689", :literature {"PUB00003156" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Xu J" "Scalzo AA" "Lyons PA" "Farrell HE" "Rawlinson WD" "Shellam GR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
