{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents the stand-alone version of an RNA-binding ANTAR domain (AmiR-like) that affects anti-termination [[cite:PUB00011193], [cite:PUB00011194], [cite:PUB00011191]]. This domain is most often found fused to the CheY-like receiver domain to form response regulator anti-terminator ([interpro:IPR008327]). Superficially, the coiled-coil and three-helix bundle that form this domain in AmiR [[cite:PUB00011191]] ([interpro:IPR008327]) appear radically different from the compact HTH DNA-binding domain of the NarL protein. However, the last three helices in AmiR are very similar in length and hydropathy profiles to those of NarL and its homologues, and are arranged in a very similar topology, suggesting an evolutionary relationship [[cite:PUB00011191]]. These C-terminal helices of AmiR appear to be essential for its transcription anti-termination activity [[cite:PUB00011191]]. However, helix-turn-helix domains like those in NarL or OmpR [[cite:PUB00011096]] are adapted to sequence-specific binding in the major groove of double-stranded B-form DNA. It is not clear how such a structure might function in a protein whose role is to prevent the formation of a termination stem-loop structure, by binding single-stranded RNA [[cite:PUB00011191]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF010636" "Predicted transcription antitermination regulator, stand-alone ANTAR domain type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ANTAR transcription anti-termination regulator", "short" "ANTAR_transcrpt_antiterm_reg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 132, "taxa" 440, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 511, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 351}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024189", :literature {"PUB00011194" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Wilson SA" "Wachira SJ" "Norman RA" "Pearl LH" "Drew RE."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=8918468", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Transcription antitermination regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa amidase operon.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "5907-16", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8918468}, "PUB00011193" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shu CJ" "Zhulin IB."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
