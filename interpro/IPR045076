{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication and is essential for combating the adverse effects of damage to the genome. It involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that have been missed by the proofreading element of the DNA polymerase complex. The post-replicative Mismatch Repair System (MMRS) of Escherichia coli involves MutS (Mutator S), MutL and MutH proteins, and acts to correct point mutations or small insertion/deletion loops produced during DNA replication [[cite:PUB00042612]]. MutS and MutL are involved in preventing recombination between partially homologous DNA sequences. The assembly of MMRS is initiated by MutS, which recognises and binds to mispaired nucleotides and allows further action of MutL and MutH to eliminate a portion of newly synthesized DNA strand containing the mispaired base [[cite:PUB00042613]]. MutS can also collaborate with methyltransferases in the repair of O(6)-methylguanine damage, which would otherwise pair with thymine during replication to create an O(6)mG:T mismatch [[cite:PUB00042614]]. MutS exists as a dimer, where the two monomers have different conformations and form a heterodimer at the structural level [[cite:PUB00042218]]. Only one monomer recognises the mismatch specifically and has ADP bound. Non-specific major groove DNA-binding domains from both monomers embrace the DNA in a clamp-like structure. Mismatch binding induces ATP uptake and a conformational change in the MutS protein, resulting in a clamp that translocates on DNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036678", "name" "MutS, connector domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016151", "name" "DNA mismatch repair protein MutS, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036187", "name" "DNA mismatch repair protein MutS, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48466" "OS10G0509000 PROTEIN-RELATED", "PTHR11361" "DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN MUTS FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA mismatch repair MutS", "short" "MutS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 59, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10024, "taxa" 41124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 98540, "sets" 0, "proteins" 98540, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 70038}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
