{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Terminal beta-(1->2)-arabinofuranosyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (AftB) and similar sequences specific to mycobacteriales. AftB is involved in the biosynthesis of the arabinogalactan (AG) region of the mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. It catalyses the transfer of arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues from the sugar donor decaprenyl-phospho-arabinose (DPA) to the arabinan domain to form terminal beta-(1->2)-linked Araf residues, which marks the end point for AG arabinan biosynthesis before decoration with mycolic acids [[cite:PUB00151340], [cite:PUB00151456]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041480" "flagellar motor control protein ZomB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Terminal beta-(1->2)-arabinofuranosyltransferase-like", "short" "AftB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 194, "taxa" 730, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 760, "sets" 0, "proteins" 760, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 623}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
