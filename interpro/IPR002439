{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Facilitative sugar transport is mediated by members of the GLUT transporter family, which form an aqueous pore across the membrane through which sugars can move in a passive (i.e., energy-independent) manner. The GLUT family of glycosylated transmembrane proteins are predicted to span the membrane 12 times with both amino- and carboxyl-termini located in the cytosol. On the basis of sequence homology and structural similarity, three subclasses of sugar transporters have been defined: Class I (GLUTs 1-4) are glucose transporters; Class II (GLUTs 5, 7, 9 and 11) are fructose transporters; and Class III (GLUTs 6, 8, 10, 12 and HMIT1) are structurally atypical members of the GLUT family, which are poorly defined at present, indeed GLUT6 may only be a pseudo-gene [[cite:PUB00005353], [cite:PUB00006044], [cite:PUB00005096], [cite:PUB00002464], [cite:PUB00006047]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents GLUT1 (also called HepG2), which is the most ubiquitously distributed of the glucose transporter isoform. It is highly expressed in foetal tissues and adult brain microvessels. It is thought to provide glucose transport in various cells that form barriers between body tissues and the blood supply. It is found in epithelial and endothelial barrier cells, such as those that constitute the blood-brain barrier, and also in the placenta.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01190" "GLUCTRSPORT1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose transporter, type 1 (GLUT1)", "short" "Glu_transpt_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 479, "taxa" 1535, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1999, "sets" 0, "proteins" 680, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 530}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2099", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2099"} {"accession" "GenProp2089", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2089"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002439", :literature {"PUB00005353" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gould GW" "Bell GI."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
