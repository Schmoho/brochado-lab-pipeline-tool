{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The following proteins have been shown [[cite:PUB00004728], [cite:PUB00028001]] to be structurally and evolutionary related:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Riboflavin synthase alpha chain ([ec:2.5.1.9]) (RS-alpha) (gene ribC in Escherichia coli, ribB in Bacillus subtilis and Photobacterium leiognathi, RIB5 in yeast. This enzyme synthesises riboflavin from two moles of 6,7- dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine (Lum), a pteridine-derivative.</li>\r\n<li>Photobacterium phosphoreum lumazine protein (LumP) (gene luxL). LumP is a protein that modulates the colour of the bioluminescence emission of bacterial luciferase. In the presence of LumP, light emission is shifted to higher energy values (shorter wavelength). LumP binds non-covalently to 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine.</li>\r\n<li>Vibrio fischeri yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (gene luxY). Like LumP, YFP modulates light emission but towards a longer wavelength. YFP binds non-covalently to FMN.</li>\r\n<li>Aliivibrio fischeri blue fluorescence protein.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These proteins seem to have evolved from the duplication of a domain of about 100 residues. In its C-terminal section, this domain contains a conserved motif [KR]-V-N-[LI]-E which has been proposed to be the binding site for lumazine (Lum) and some of its derivatives. RS-alpha which binds two molecules of Lum has two perfect copies of this motif, while LumP which binds one molecule of Lum, has a Glu instead of Lys/Arg in the first position of the second copy of the motif. Similarly, YFP, which binds to one molecule of FMN, also seems to have a potentially dysfunctional binding site by substitution of Gly for Glu in the last position of the first copy of the motif.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4g6i", "name" "Crystallographic structure of trimeric riboflavin synthase from Brucella abortus in complex with roseoflavin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017938", "name" "Riboflavin synthase-like beta-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00402" "Riboflavin synthase and similar proteins"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00187" "riboflavin synthase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000498" "Riboflavin synthase, alpha subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR21098" "RIBOFLAVIN SYNTHASE ALPHA CHAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lumazine-binding protein", "short" "Lumazine-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9825, "taxa" 36631, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40734, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31201}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00581", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00581"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1734", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1734"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
