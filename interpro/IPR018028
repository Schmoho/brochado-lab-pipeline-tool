{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Catalases ([ec:1.11.1.6]) are antioxidant enzymes that catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen, serving to protect cells from its toxic effects [[cite:PUB00012765]]. Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a consequence of oxidative cellular metabolism and can be converted to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical via transition metals, this radical being able to damage a wide variety of molecules within a cell, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Catalases act to neutralise hydrogen peroxide toxicity, and are produced by all aerobic organisms ranging from bacteria to man. Most catalases are mono-functional, haem-containing enzymes, although there are also bifunctional haem-containing peroxidase/catalases ([interpro:IPR000763]) that are closely related to plant peroxidases, and non-haem, manganese-containing catalases ([interpro:IPR007760]) that are found in bacteria [[cite:PUB00015054]]. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, catalases can be classified into clade 1, 2 and 3. Clade 1 contains small subunit catalases from plants and a subset of bacteria; clade 2 contains large subunit catalases from fungi and a second subset of bacteria; and clade 3 contains small subunit catalases from bacteria, fungi, protists, animals, and plants [[cite:PUB00056180], [cite:PUB00027249]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the mono-functional, haem-containing catalases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3e4w", "name" "Crystal structure of a 33kDa catalase-related protein from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.
