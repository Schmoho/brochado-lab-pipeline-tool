The bc1 complex contains 11 subunits; 3 respiratory subunits (cytochrome B, cytochrome C1, Rieske protein), 2 core proteins and 6 low molecular weight proteins. This family represents the 'hinge' protein of the complex, subunit 6, which is thought to mediate formation of the cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c complex.
