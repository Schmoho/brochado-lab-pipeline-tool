{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>7-deazapurines are compounds that contain pyrrolopyrimidine functional groups (similar to purines, but lacking one of the nitrogens in the pentameric ring). These compounds form a structurally diverse class of nucleoside analogues that often possess antibiotic, antineoplastic, or antiviral activities. Examples of 7-deazapurines that are important for cell function include the bacterial/eukaryotic modified tRNA base queuosine and the archaeal modified base archaeosine. 7-cyano-7-deazaguanosine (preQ0) is the precursor for all 7-deazapurines and is produced from GTP in a four-step pathway [[cite:PUB00035932], [cite:PUB00056816]]. 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase catalyses the third step in this pathway, the conversion of 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin to 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00300" "7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase, Cx3CxxC type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03365" "7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase QueE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase", "short" "Deazaguanine_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 597, "taxa" 2512, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2516, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2516, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1971}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1602", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1602"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
