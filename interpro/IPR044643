{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N-(5'-phosphoribosyl) anthranilate isomerase (PRAI) is an enzyme that catalyses the third step of tryptophan biosynthesis.</p>\n\n<p>Phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase is monomeric and labile in most mesophilic microorganisms, but dimeric and stable in the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima (tPRAI) [[cite:PUB00006524]]. The comparison to the known 2.0 A structure of PRAI from Escherichia coli (ePRAI) shows that tPRAI has the complete TIM- or (β/α)8-barrel fold, whereas helix α5 in ePRAI is replaced by a loop. The subunits of tPRAI associate via the N-terminal faces of their central β-barrels. Two long, symmetry-related loops that protrude reciprocally into cavities of the other subunit provide for multiple hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the side chains of the N-terminal methionines and the C-terminal leucines of both subunits are immobilized in a hydrophobic cluster, and the number of salt bridges is increased in tPRAI. These features appear to be mainly responsible for the high thermostability of tPRAI [[cite:PUB00006375]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1nsj", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF PHOSPHORIBOSYL ANTHRANILATE ISOMERASE FROM THERMOTOGA MARITIMA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42894" "N-(5'-PHOSPHORIBOSYL)ANTHRANILATE ISOMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase family", "short" "TrpF_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6695, "taxa" 26598, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31472, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31472, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23959}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
