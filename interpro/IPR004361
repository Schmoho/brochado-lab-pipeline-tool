{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glyoxalase I (lactoylglutathione lyase) catalyzes the first step of the glyoxal pathway in the following reaction:</p>\n\n<p><reaction> glutathione + methylglyoxal = (R)-S-lactoylglutathione </reaction></p>\n\n<p>S-lactoylglutathione is then converted by glyoxalase II to lactic acid [[cite:PUB00002779]]. Glyoxalase I is a ubiquitous enzyme which binds one mole of zinc per subunit. The bacterial and yeast enzymes are monomeric while the mammalian one is homodimeric. The sequence of glyoxalase I is well conserved. In bacteria and mammals the enzyme is a protein of about 130 to 180 residues while in fungi it is about twice as long. In these organisms the enzyme is built out of the tandem repeat of a homologous domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4mts", "name" "Ni- and Zn-bound GloA2 at high resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00068" "lactoylglutathione lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glyoxalase I", "short" "Glyoxalase_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 33, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4268, "taxa" 17795, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17166, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15825, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11495}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00720", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00720"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1578", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1578"} {"accession" "GenProp0744", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0744"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
