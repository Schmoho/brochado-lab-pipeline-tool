{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA repair, though not as well characterised as DNA repair, is an important component of many biological systems. These include the kinteoplastid RNA-editing process and the defence of Bacteriophage T4 against tRNA damage caused by host nucleases. RNA ligase is an essential enzyme in the process of RNA repair [[cite:PUB00035972]]. It is part of the broader nucleotidyl transferase superfamily which includes DNA ligase and RNA capping enzymes, and has the same basic mechanism as other memebers of this family. The RNA ligase family is divided into two distinct branches: the Rnl-1 like proteins, found only in viruses and fungi so far, and the Rnl2-like proteins which have been found in all three kingdoms of life.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a small group of known and predicted RNA ligases found in some bacterial and phage species. The best characterised memeber is found in Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium capable of withstanding a variety of adverse environmental conditions including extreme amounts of radiation. Ligase activity is apparently specific to nicks within either duplex RNA or an RNA:DNA hybrid and is dependenton divalent cations such as manganese [[cite:PUB00017748]]. These proteins have a distinctive domain structure, lacking the C-terminal domain observed in other Rnl2-like ligases, and possesing a distinctive N-terminal domain not found in other ligases but which is important for catalytic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vtb", "name" "Naegleria gruberi RNA ligase K326A mutant with ATP and Mn"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02306" "RNA ligase (ATP)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA ligase, DRB0094", "short" "RNA_ligase_DRB0094"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 324, "taxa" 1459, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 528}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012646", :literature {"PUB00035972" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wood ZA" "Sabatini RS" "Hajduk SL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
