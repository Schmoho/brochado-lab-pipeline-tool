{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes virilizer (VIR1), the yeast homologue of human virilizer (VIRMA) [[cite:PUB00154326]].

In the complex, it plays a scaffolding role, stabilising the other complex members [[cite:PUB00154326]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22575" "Virilizer, yeast"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Virilizer, yeast", "short" "VIR1_yeast"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 157, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 132, "sets" 0, "proteins" 65, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 53}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054776", :literature {"PUB00154326" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Park ZM" "Belnap E" "Remillard M" "Rose MD."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyad043", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Vir1p, the yeast homolog of virilizer, is required for mRNA m6A methylation and meiosis.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "iyad043", "volume" "224", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36930734}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045944", "name" "positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051321", "name" "meiotic cell cycle", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054776", "name" "Virilizer, yeast", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 77}}}
