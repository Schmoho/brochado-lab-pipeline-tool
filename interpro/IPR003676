{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant auxin-responsive proteins, known as small auxin-up RNA (SAUR) [[cite:PUB00074921]]. The first SAUR gene was originally identified in soybean hypocotyls [[cite:PUB00074922]]. SAUR genes are mainly expressed in growing hypocotyls or other elongating tissues, implying that they play a role in the regulation of cell elongation [[cite:PUB00074921]]. SAUR proteins may provide a mechanistic link between auxin and plasma membrane H+-ATPases (PM H+-ATPases) in Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00074923]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35296" "EXPRESSED PROTEIN", "PTHR31374" "AUXIN-INDUCED PROTEIN-LIKE-RELATED", "PTHR31929" "SAUR-LIKE AUXIN-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN FAMILY-RELATED", "PTHR31175" "AUXIN-RESPONSIVE FAMILY PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF02519" "Auxin responsive protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small auxin-up RNA", "short" "SAUR_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 230, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1011, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30288, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29224, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18235}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003676", :literature {"PUB00074923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Spartz AK" "Ren H" "Park MY" "Grandt KN" "Lee SH" "Murphy AS" "Sussman MR" "Overvoorde PJ" "Gray WM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.114.126037", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "SAUR Inhibition of PP2C-D Phosphatases Activates Plasma Membrane H+-ATPases to Promote Cell Expansion in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "2129-2142", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24858935}, "PUB00074921" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Gil P" "Green PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
