{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Shisa is a transmembrane, transcription factor-type protein that physically interacts with immature forms of the Wnt receptor Frizzled and the FGF receptor within the endoplasmic reticulum to inhibit their post-translational maturation and trafficking to the cell surface [[cite:PUB00062012], [cite:PUB00062003]].</p>\r\n<p>The Shisa family founding member, Xenopus Shisa, promotes head development by antagonising Wnt and FGF signaling [[cite:PUB00062002]]. Several vertebrate homologues have been identified with implicated roles in development, cancer and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00062018], [cite:PUB00062019], [cite:PUB00062020]]. Distantly related Shisa homologues have also been detected that possess an N-terminal domain with six conserved cysteines. These Shisa-like proteins include SHISAL1 (shisa-like-1, also known as KIAA1644), SHISAL2A (FAM159A) and SHISAL2B (FAM159B) from vertebrates [[cite:PUB00062005]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5m0w", "name" "N-terminal domain of mouse Shisa 3"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31395" "SHISA", "PTHR31774" "PROTEIN SHISA-9-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shisa", "short" "Shisa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 758, "taxa" 2991, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9679, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9679, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6312}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026910", :literature {"PUB00062003" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hedge TA" "Mason I."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
