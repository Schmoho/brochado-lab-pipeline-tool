{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of thioredoxin domain-containing proteins, including TXNDC17 from animals, SPBC21C3.12c from fission yeasts and AtClot from Arabidopsis. TXNDC17, also known as TRP14, is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed oxidoreductase involved in controlling of cellular redox signalling pathways. TXNDC17 has been shown to efficiently reduce l-cystine and can directly reactivate oxidized protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B  [[cite:PUB00098049]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7xq3", "name" "Crystal structure of the tetramer of thioredoxin domain containing-protein of Oncomelania hupensis(OhTRP14)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12452" "42-9-9 PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17-like", "short" "TXNDC17-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1877, "taxa" 6710, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3454, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3454, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2265}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045108", :literature {"PUB00098049" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Espinosa B" "Arner ESJ."], "ISO_journal" "Br J Pharmacol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Br J Pharmacol", "title" "Thioredoxin-related protein of 14Â kDa as a modulator of redox signalling pathways.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "544-553", "volume" "176", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30129655}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0047134", "name" "protein-disulfide reductase (NAD(P)H) activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045108", "name" "Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
