{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a bacterial outer membrane lipoprotein that is necessary for signalling by the Cpx pathway [[cite:PUB00010108]]. This pathway responds to cell envelope disturbances and increases the expression of periplasmic protein folding and degradation factors. While the molecular function of the NlpE protein is unknown, it may be involved in detecting bacterial adhesion to abiotic surfaces. NlpE from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi is also known to confer copper tolerance in copper-sensitive strains of E. coli, and may be involved in copper efflux and delivery of copper to copper-dependent enzymes [[cite:PUB00009886]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3lhn", "name" "Crystal structure of putative lipoprotein (NP_718719.1) from Shewanella oneidensis at 1.42 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043176", "name" "NlpE, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04170" "NlpE N-terminal domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Copper resistance lipoprotein NlpE", "short" "Cu-R_lipoprotein_NlpE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 35, "proteomes" 884, "taxa" 4841, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5511, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5491, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4319}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007298", :literature {"PUB00009886" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Gupta SD" "Lee BT" "Camakaris J" "Wu HC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
