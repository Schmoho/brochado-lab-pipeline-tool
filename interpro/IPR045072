{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MKRN protein family includes the ribonucleoproteins that are characterised by a variety of zinc-finger motifs, including typical arrays of one to four C3H1-type zinc fingers and a C3HC4-type RING-HC finger. Another motif rich in Cys and His residues (CH), with so far unknown function, is also generally present in MKRN proteins. MKRN proteins may have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [[cite:PUB00097982], [cite:PUB00075978]]. At least four makorin genes exist in vertebrates [[cite:PUB00060358]].</p>\n\n<p>Makorin-3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties onto substrate proteins. it acts as a key developmental timer that helps ensure puberty begins at the appropriate age, by inhibiting premature activation of the reproductive hormone cascade. Epigenetically regulates GNRH1 transcription by disrupting the binding of methyl-DNA binding protein 3/MBD3 to the promoter of GNRH1. Mechanistically, mediates the non-proteolytic ubiquitination of MBD3 at multiple sites with 'Lys27' ubiquitin linkages and thereby regulates the methylation status of the genome, including GNRH1 promoter [[cite:PUB00158967]]. It modulates the stability and translation of GNRH1 mRNA by mediating the non-proteolytic ubiquitination of PABP family members PABPC1, PABPC3 and PABPC4 at multiple sites[[cite:PUB00158966]]. It also participates also in the maintenance of genomic and epigenomic stability by regulating the abundance of APEX2 via 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination [[cite:PUB00158968]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11224" "MAKORIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MKRN-like", "short" "MKRN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2297, "taxa" 8011, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7287, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7287, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4694}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
