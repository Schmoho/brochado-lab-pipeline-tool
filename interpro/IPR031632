{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes mammalian SVIP, small VCP/p97-interacting protein and its orthologues from yeast. SVIP was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening to be an interactive partner of VCP/p97. Mammalian VCP/p97 and its yeast counterpart Cdc48 participate in the formation of organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and nuclear envelope. SVIP has been identified as an endogenous inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation [[cite:PUB00155951], [cite:PUB00155952]]. Over-expression of SVIP caused the formation of large vacuoles that seemed to be derived from the ER [[cite:PUB00075970]]. Proteins in this family have two putative coiled-coil regions and are approximately 80 amino acids in length.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15811" "Small VCP/p97-interacting protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small VCP/p97-interacting protein", "short" "SVIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 1236, "taxa" 4573, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1986, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1261}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031632", :literature {"PUB00075970" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Nagahama M" "Suzuki M" "Hamada Y" "Hatsuzawa K" "Tani K" "Yamamoto A" "Tagaya M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
