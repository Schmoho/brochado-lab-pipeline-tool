{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Venus Flytrap protein PfVFT1 from Plasmodium falciparum and similar proteins from Apicomplexa. PfVFT1 is a highly immunogenic protein, but its biological role in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is unknown. It is a parasite-specific antigen expressed by the P. falciparum 3D7 strain in both sexual and asexual stages and was identified as a major candidate for inclusion in a multicomponent blood stage malaria vaccine. Bioinformatic analysis predicts a signal peptide with no identifiable membrane anchors suggesting that it coordinates a membrane-associated partner to enable surface localisation. Fractionation of detergent-resistant membranes showed that PfVFT1 clusters with GPI-anchored parasite proteins including Pf38, Pf92, Pf113, PfMSP-1, PfMSP-4, PfASP, and PfRAMA [[cite:PUB00148817], [cite:PUB00148818]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd22854" "Plasmodium falciparum Venus Flytrap protein PfVFT1 and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Venus Flytrap-like", "short" "PfVFT1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 91, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 77, "sets" 0, "proteins" 77, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 77}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049856", :literature {"PUB00148817" {"URL" nil, "issue" "247", "authors" ["Osier FH" "Mackinnon MJ" "Crosnier C" "Fegan G" "Kamuyu G" "Wanaguru M" "Ogada E" "McDade B" "Rayner JC" "Wright GJ" "Marsh K."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Transl Med", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Transl Med", "title" "New antigens for a multicomponent blood-stage malaria vaccine.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "247ra102", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25080477}, "PUB00148818" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Parker ML" "Ramaswamy R" "van Gordon K" "Powell CJ" "Bosch J" "Boulanger MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "The structure of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7_0606800 reveals a bi-lobed architecture that supports re-annotation as a Venus Flytrap protein.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1878-1885", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28681555}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049856", "name" "Venus Flytrap-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
