{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the LolC protein, and its paralog LolE found in some species. These proteins are homologous to permease proteins of ABC transporters. In some species, two paralogs occur, designated LolC and LolE. In others, a single form is found and tends to be designated LolC [[cite:PUB00015507]].</p>\n\n<p>The LolCDE complex releases lipoproteins from the inner membrane, thereby initiating lipoprotein sorting to the outer membrane. The LolCDE complex in Escherichia coli is composed of two copies of an ATPase subunit, LolD, and one copy each of integral membrane subunits LolC and LolE [[cite:PUB00015507]]. The LolCDE complex releases the lipoproteins in the periplasm, where they form a complex with LolA. The LolA-lipoprotein complex crosses the periplasm to reach the outer membrane, where LolB incorporates the lipoprotein into the outer membrane. LolA is involved in the interaction with membrane subunit LolC, whereas no interaction has been observed with LolE. This observations indicate that LolC and LolE may play different roles in the lipoprotein transfer despite their structural resemblance [[cite:PUB00061667], [cite:PUB00061668]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02212" "lipoprotein-releasing ABC transporter permease subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipoprotein-releasing system transmembrane protein LolC/E", "short" "LolCE_TM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3248, "taxa" 13296, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18491, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18490, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0207", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0207"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011925", :literature {"PUB00015507" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Narita S" "Kanamaru K" "Matsuyama S" "Tokuda H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
