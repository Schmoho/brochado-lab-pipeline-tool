{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The prokineticin family includes prokinectin itself and related proteins such as BM8 and the AVIToxins. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls the circadian rhythm of physiological and behavioural processes in mammals. It has been shown that prokineticin 2 (PK2), a cysteine-rich secreted protein, functions as an output molecule from the SCN circadian clock. PK2 messenger RNA is rhythmically expressed in the SCN, and the phase of PK2 rhythm is responsive to light entrainment. Molecular and genetic studies have revealed that PK2 is a gene that is controlled by a circadian clock [[cite:PUB00012756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18821" "PROKINETICIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prokineticin", "short" "Prokineticin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 633, "taxa" 2200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1553, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1553, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1052}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009523", :literature {"PUB00012756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6887", "authors" ["Cheng MY" "Bullock CM" "Li C" "Lee AG" "Bermak JC" "Belluzzi J" "Weaver DR" "Leslie FM" "Zhou QY."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/417405a", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Prokineticin 2 transmits the behavioural circadian rhythm of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "405-10", "volume" "417", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12024206}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009523", "name" "Prokineticin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
