{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The T-box gene family is an ancient group of putative transcription factors that appear to play a critical role in the development of all animal species.</p>\r\n<p>These genes were uncovered on the basis of similarity to the DNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00000739]] of murine Brachyury (T) gene product, which similarity is the defining feature of the family. The Brachyury gene is named for its phenotype, which was identified 70 years ago as a mutant mouse strain with a short blunted tail. The gene, and its paralogues, have become a well-studied model for the family, and hence much of what is known about the T-box family is derived from the murine Brachyury gene.</p>\r\n<p>Consistent with its nuclear location, Brachyury protein has a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity and can act as a transcriptional regulator [[cite:PUB00001985]]. Homozygous mutants for the gene undergo extensive developmental anomalies, thus rendering the mutation lethal [[cite:PUB00006158]]. The postulated role of Brachyury is as a transcription factor, regulating the specification and differentiation of posterior mesoderm during gastrulation in a dose-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00000739]].</p>\r\n<p>Common features shared by T-box family members are, DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory activity, a role in development and conserved expression patterns, most of the known genes in all species being expressed in mesoderm of mesoderm precursors [[cite:PUB00005531]]. Members of the T-box family contain a domain of about 170 to 190 amino acids known as the T-box domain [[cite:PUB00003895], [cite:PUB00001941], [cite:PUB00005531]] and which probably binds DNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008967", "name" "p53-like transcription factor, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036960", "name" "T-box superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00938" "BRACHYURY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor, Brachyury", "short" "TF_Brachyury"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 58, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 933, "taxa" 3889, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16067, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4937, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3330}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002070", :literature {"PUB00003895" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bollag RJ" "Siegfried Z" "Cebra-Thomas JA" "Garvey N" "Davison EM" "Silver LM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
