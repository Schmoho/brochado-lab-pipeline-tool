{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Budding yeast Slm4 is a component of both the GSE and the EGO complexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GSE (GAP1 Sorting in the Endosomes) complex is a GTPase complex required for intracellular sorting of Gap1 out of the endosome, which is required for the eventual delivery of GAP1 to the plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00045964]]. The GSE complex is composed of two small GTPases (Gtr1 and Gtr2), as well as three other proteins (Slm4, Meh1 and Ltv1) that are located in the late endosomal membrane. Gtr2 interacts with the C-terminal cytosolic domain of Gap1; a tyrosine-containing motif in this domain is necessary both to bind Gtr2 and to direct sorting of GAP1 to the plasma membrane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EGO complex is involved in the regulation of microautophagy [[cite:PUB00045965]]. The EGO complex is composed of at least Gtr2, Slm4 and Meh1 subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16818" "Protein SLM4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GSE/EGO complex subunit Slm4", "short" "Slm4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 62, "taxa" 215, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 112, "sets" 0, "proteins" 112, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 87}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020233", :literature {"PUB00045964" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Gao M" "Kaiser CA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
