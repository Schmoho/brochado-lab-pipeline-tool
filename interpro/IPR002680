{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The alternative oxidase (AOX) is an enzyme that forms part of the electron transport chain in mitochondria of different organisms [[cite:PUB00073500], [cite:PUB00073501]]. Proteins homologous to the mitochondrial oxidase have also been identified in bacterial genomes [[cite:PUB00073503], [cite:PUB00073504]]. The oxidase provides an alternative route for electrons passing through the electron transport chain to reduce oxygen. However, as several proton-pumping steps are bypassed in this alternative pathway, activation of the oxidase reduces ATP generation. This enzyme was first identified as a distinct oxidase pathway from cytochrome c oxidase as the alternative oxidase is resistant to inhibition by the poison cyanide [[cite:PUB00073502]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alternative oxidase (also known as ubiquinol oxidase) is used as a second terminal oxidase in the mitochondria, electrons are transferred directly from reduced ubiquinol to oxygen forming water [[cite:PUB00001938]]. This is not coupled to ATP synthesis and is not inhibited by cyanide, this pathway is a single step process [[cite:PUB00001878]]. In Oryza sativa (rice) the transcript levels of the alternative oxidase are increased by low temperature [[cite:PUB00001878]]. It has been predicted to contain a coupled diiron centre on the basis of a conserved sequence motif consisting of the proposed iron ligands, four Glu and two His residues [[cite:PUB00009825]]. The EPR study of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress) alternative oxidase AOX1a shows that the enzyme contains a hydroxo-bridged mixed-valent Fe(II)/Fe(III) binuclear iron centre [[cite:PUB00009826]]. A catalytic cycle has been proposed that involves a di-iron centre and at least one transient protein-derived radical, most probably an invariant Tyr residue [[cite:PUB00009827]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038659", "name" "Alternative oxidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01053" "Alternative oxidase, ferritin-like diiron-binding domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR31803" "ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01786" "Alternative oxidase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005229" "Alternative oxidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alternative oxidase", "short" "AOX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 95, "proteomes" 1920, "taxa" 7064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6945, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6811, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4514}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1230", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1230"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
