{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the family of YlcG ([swissprot:Q47272]) from the DLP12 prophage region of Eschichia coli K-12, and homologues from the Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 prophage regions of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2. Members of this family are small, about 46 amino acids long. YlcG is known to be expressed. It is encoded immediately downstream of the Holliday junction resolvase RusA by  the cryptic lambdoid prophage DLP12.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033498" "YlcG family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YlcG-like", "short" "YlcG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 41, "taxa" 410, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 729, "sets" 0, "proteins" 729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 533}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049596", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049596", "name" "YlcG-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
