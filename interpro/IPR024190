{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The N(5),N(10)-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase system of methanogenic archaea is composed of H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd, [pirsf:PIRSF016158], this group) and F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00014604], [cite:PUB00014605]] ([pirsf:PIRSF005627]). Hmd is an iron-sulphur-cluster-free enzyme that contains an intrinsic CO ligand bound to iron [[cite:PUB00016833]]. [pirsf:PIRSF016158] contains two distinct subgroups: one has been experimentally characterised as H2-forming N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd or HmdI, [pirsf:PIRSF500165]), and the other one contains isozymes that have not been experimentally characterised (HmdII and HmdIII, [pirsf:PIRSF500166]). Because all three isozyme forms are present in each of the corresponding sequenced genomes, it has been suggested that HmdII and HmdIII may not exhibit Hmd activity and may have a different biological function [[cite:PUB00013473]].</p>\n\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00014603]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hav", "name" "Crystal structure of [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd) from Methanococcus aeolicus in complex with FeGP and methenyl-tetrahydromethanopterin (close form A) at 1.06 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038182", "name" "HMD, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016158" "Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, Hmd type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, Hmd-type", "short" "METHMP_Hmd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 142, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 189, "sets" 0, "proteins" 189, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 170}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
