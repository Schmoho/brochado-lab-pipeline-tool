{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Cytochrome B6-F complex subunit VI (PetL) proteins found in a number of plant species. PetL is one of the small subunits which make up the cytochrome b(6)f complex. PetL is not absolutely required for either the accumulation or for the function of cytochrome b6f; in its absence, however, the complex becomes unstable<i>in vivo</i>in aging cells and labile<i>in vitro</i>. It has been suggested that the N terminus of the protein is likely to lie in the thylakoid lumen [[cite:PUB00010203]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9es7", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of Spinacia oleracea cytochrome b6f complex with water molecules at 1.94 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37266" "CYTOCHROME B6-F COMPLEX SUBUNIT 6"}, "hamap" {"MF_00433" "Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 6 [petL]"}, "pfam" {"PF05115" "Cytochrome B6-F complex subunit VI (PetL)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 6", "short" "Cyt_b6/f_cplx_su6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 186, "taxa" 20305, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13584, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10965}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1353", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1353"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007802", :literature {"PUB00010203" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Zito F" "Vinh J" "Popot JL" "Finazzi G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
