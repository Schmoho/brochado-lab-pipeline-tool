{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg, MutM) is a trifunctional DNA base excision repair enzyme that removes a wide range of oxidation-damaged bases (N-glycosylase activity; [ec:3.2.2.23]) and cleaves both the 3'- and 5'-phosphodiester bonds of the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP lyase activity; [ec:4.2.99.18]). Fpg has a preference for oxidised purines, excising oxidized purine bases such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). ITs AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity introduces nicks in the DNA strand, cleaving the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break at the site of the removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Fpg is a monomer composed of 2 domains connected by a flexible hinge [[cite:PUB00014010]]. The two DNA-binding motifs (a zinc finger and the helix-two-turns-helix motifs) suggest that the oxidized base is flipped out from double-stranded DNA in the binding mode and excised by a catalytic mechanism similar to that of bifunctional base excision repair enzymes [[cite:PUB00014010]]. Fpg binds one ion of zinc at the C terminus, which contains four conserved and essential cysteines [[cite:PUB00002832], [cite:PUB00003593]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3u6p", "name" "MutM set 1 GpG"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035937", "name" "MutM-like, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00103" "Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase [mutM]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00577" "DNA-formamidopyrimidine glycosylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase", "short" "Formamido-pyr_DNA_Glyclase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 74, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7031, "taxa" 27335, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30407, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23205}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1099", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1099"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
