{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine represent a group of naturally occurring compounds exerting a bewildering number of biological effects. Their biosynthesis is accomplished by a concerted action of four different enzymes: ornithine decarboxylase, adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, spermidine synthase and spermine synthase. The development and introduction of specific inhibitors to the biosynthetic enzymes of the polyamines have revealed that an undisturbed synthesis of the polyamines is a prerequisite for animal cell proliferation to occur [[cite:PUB00034968]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3c6k", "name" "Crystal structure of human spermine synthase in complex with spermidine and 5-methylthioadenosine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46315" "SPERMINE SYNTHASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spermine synthase, animal", "short" "Spermine_synthase_animal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 708, "taxa" 3184, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1646, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1646, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1084}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
