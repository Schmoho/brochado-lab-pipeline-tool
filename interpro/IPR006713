{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Afa/Dr family of adhesins bind to the Dr blood group antigen component of decay-accelerating factor. These proteins contain both fimbriated and afimbriated adherence structures and mediate adherence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to the urinary tract, leading to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pregnancy complications [[cite:PUB00099772], [cite:PUB00008499]]. They also confer the mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MHRA) phenotype, which can be inhibited by chloramphenicol.  The N-terminal portion of the mature protein is thought to be responsible for chloramphenicol sensitivity [[cite:PUB00008500]]. These proteins remain attached to host cells or collagen once bound even in the presence of elevated shear stress or of chloramphenicol, a competitive inhibitor of binding [[cite:PUB00099773]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ut1", "name" "DraE adhesin from Escherichia Coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008966", "name" "Adhesion domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037028", "name" "Dr-adhesin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04619" "Dr-family adhesin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adhesin, Dr-family", "short" "Adhesin_Dr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 12, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 68, "sets" 0, "proteins" 68, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 65}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006713", :literature {"PUB00008499" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhang L" "Foxman B" "Tallman P" "Cladera E" "Le Bouguenec C" "Marrs CF."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
