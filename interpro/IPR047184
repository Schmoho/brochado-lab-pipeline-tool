{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (KANK1-4) from humans and similar animal proteins. KANK1 is involved in the control of cytoskeleton formation by regulating actin polymerization. It inhibits actin fibre formation, cell migration and fibronectin-mediated cell spreading. This protein is involved in the establishment and persistence of cell polarity during directed cell movement in wound healing. [[cite:PUB00102113], [cite:PUB00102114]]. Kank1 from mouse, during cell division, may regulate DAAM1-dependent RHOA activation that signals centrosome maturation and chromosomal segregation. It may also be involved in contractile ring formation during cytokinesis [[cite:PUB00154966]]. KANK2 is involved in regulation of caspase-independent apoptosis, in the negative control of vitamin D receptor signalling pathway and in actin stress fibres formation [[cite:PUB00102113], [cite:PUB00102116], [cite:PUB00102115], [cite:PUB00053555]]. These proteins have been associated with nephrotic syndrome [[cite:PUB00102113]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ybu", "name" "Structure of the KANK1 ankyrin domain in complex with KIF21A peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24168" "KN MOTIF AND ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "KN motif and ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1-4", "short" "KANK1-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 999, "taxa" 4006, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5653, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5653, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2772}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047184", :literature {"PUB00053555" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhu Y" "Kakinuma N" "Wang Y" "Kiyama R."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
