{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c (CytC) proteins can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes.</p>\n\n<p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC.</p>\n\n<p>Class I includes the low-spin soluble CytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the haem-attachment site towards the N terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C terminus. On the basis of sequence similarity, class I CytC were further subdivided into five classes, IA to IE. Class IC, 'split-alpha-band' Cyt C, possess a widened or split alpha-band of lowered absorptivity. This class includes dihaem Cyt C4 and monohaem Cyt C6 (Cyt C-553) and Cyt C-554.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Cyt C6 [[cite:PUB00003350]] and Desulfovibrio vulgaris Cyt C-553 [[cite:PUB00002343]] have been determined. The proteins consist of 4 Î±-helices; three 'core' helices form a 'basket' around the haem group, with one haem edge exposed to the solvent.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00605" "CYTCHROMECIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c, class IC", "short" "Cyt_C_IC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3246, "taxa" 14167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 51670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25835, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19840}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
