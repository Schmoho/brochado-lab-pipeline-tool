{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the spermatogenesis-associated protein 7 (SPATA7, also known as HSD3). It was first identified in human spermatocytes. Later on, it was also found expressed in multiple layers of the mature mouse retina [[cite:PUB00070023]]. Mutations in SPATA7 cause Leber congenital amaurosis 3 (LCA3), which is a severe dystrophy of the retina, typically becoming evident in the first years of life [[cite:PUB00070023], [cite:PUB00070024]]. Mutations in SPATA7 also cause autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP), which is a retinal dystrophy belonging to the group of pigmentary retinopathies [[cite:PUB00070023]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14917" "SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7"}, "pfam" {"PF15244" "Spermatogenesis-associated protein 7, or HSD3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spermatogenesis-associated protein 7", "short" "SPATA7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 773, "taxa" 2928, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2024, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1812, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1227}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029357", :literature {"PUB00070023" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wang H" "den Hollander AI" "Moayedi Y" "Abulimiti A" "Li Y" "Collin RW" "Hoyng CB" "Lopez I" "Abboud EB" "Al-Rajhi AA" "Bray M" "Lewis RA" "Lupski JR" "Mardon G" "Koenekoop RK" "Chen R."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
