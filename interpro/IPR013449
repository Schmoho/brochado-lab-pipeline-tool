{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rhamnulokinase ([ec:2.7.1.5]) is an enzyme that catalyses the second step in rhamnose catabolism. It catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of L-rhamnulose to produce L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate and ADP. Rhamnulokinase exists as a monomer composed of two large domains. The ATP binding site is located in the cleft between the two domains. The presence of divalent Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2uyt", "name" "Structure of L-rhamnulose kinase in complex with ADP and beta-L- rhamnulose."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07771" "nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of rhamnulokinase (RhaB) and similar proteins"}, "hamap" {"MF_01535" "Rhamnulokinase [rhaB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02627" "rhamnulokinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhamnulokinase", "short" "Rhamnulokinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1938, "taxa" 7783, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9485, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7101}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0457", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0457"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
