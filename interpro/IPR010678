{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 25 (UTP25), a DEAD-box RNA helicase-like protein component of the ribosomal small subunit processome for the biogenesis of ribosomes, which functions in pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing. U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 25 homologue (also known as Digestive organ expansion factor (DEF)) from animals is essential for embryonic development in part through the regulation of p53 pathway and controls the expansion growth of digestive organs and liver [[cite:PUB00097919], [cite:PUB00097921], [cite:PUB00097922]]. It is though to be also involved in the sympathetic neuronal development. UTP25 mediates, with CAPN3, the proteasome-independent degradation of p53/TP53 [[cite:PUB00097921], [cite:PUB00097922]].</p>\n\n<p>Protein NUCLEOLAR FACTOR 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (Nof1) is also included in this group. This protein is involved in the control of rRNA expression, embryo development and female gametogenesis [[cite:PUB00100328]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12933" "ORF PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 25", "short" "UTP25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2571, "taxa" 8797, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4806, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4806, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3123}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010678", :literature {"PUB00100328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Harscoet E" "Dubreucq B" "Palauqui JC" "Lepiniec L."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "NOF1 encodes an Arabidopsis protein involved in the control of rRNA expression.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "e12829", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20877469}, "PUB00097922" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Tao T" "Shi H" "Guan Y" "Huang D" "Chen Y" "Lane DP" "Chen J" "Peng J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "Def defines a conserved nucleolar pathway that leads p53 to proteasome-independent degradation.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "620-34", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23357851}, "PUB00097921" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Guan Y" "Huang D" "Chen F" "Gao C" "Tao T" "Shi H" "Zhao S" "Liao Z" "Lo LJ" "Wang Y" "Chen J" "Peng J."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Phosphorylation of Def Regulates Nucleolar p53 Turnover and Cell Cycle Progression through Def Recruitment of Calpain3.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1002555", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27657329}, "PUB00097919" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lei H" "Tang J" "Li H" "Zhang H" "Lu C" "Chen H" "Li W" "Xia Y" "Tang W."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Gastroenterol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Gastroenterol", "title" "MiR-195 affects cell migration and cell proliferation by down-regulating DIEXF in Hirschsprung's disease.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "123", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25007945}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0034511", "name" "U3 snoRNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006364", "name" "rRNA processing", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005730", "name" "nucleolus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010678", "name" "U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 25", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
