{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Faithful inheritance of organelles by daughter cells is essential to retain the benefits afforded to eukaryotic cells by compartmentalisation of biochemical functions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the class V myosin, Myo2p, is involved in transporting different organelles, including the peroxisome, along actin cables to the bud [[cite:PUB00060256]].</p>\n\n<p>Inp2p has been identified as the peroxisome-specific receptor for Myo2p. Cells lacking Inp2p fail to partition peroxisomes to the bud, although they are unaffected in the inheritance of other organelles. Inp2p is a peroxisomal membrane protein, interacting directly with the globular tail of Myo2p. Cells that over-produce Inp2p often transfer their entire populations of peroxisomes to buds. Levels of Inp2p oscillate with the cell cycle. Organelle-specific receptors like Inp2p illustrate how a single motor can move different organelles in distinct and specific patterns. Inp2p is the first peroxisomal protein implicated in the vectorial movement of peroxisomes [[cite:PUB00060256]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02104" "Inheritance of peroxisomes protein 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inheritance of peroxisomes protein 2", "short" "INP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 133, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 299, "sets" 0, "proteins" 67, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 56}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026235", :literature {"PUB00060256" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Fagarasanu A" "Fagarasanu M" "Eitzen GA" "Aitchison JD" "Rachubinski RA."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
