{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family contain SH3 and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, with the FN3 domains inserted within the SH3 domains.  Members include peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1 (PRAX-1, TSPOAP1 or RIMBP1, also known as RIMS-binding protein 1 or TSPO-associated protein 1) and RIMS-binding protein 2 (RIMBP2).  PRAX-1 interacts with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor [[cite:PUB00085479]].  RIMBP2 interacts with subunits of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels [[cite:PUB00085469]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>RIMs binding proteins (RBPs, RIM-BPs) associate with calcium channels present in photoreceptors, neurons, and hair cells; they interact simultaneously with specific calcium channel subunits, and active zone proteins, RIM1 and RIM2 [[cite:PUB00085469]]. RIMs are part of the matrix at the presynaptic active zone and are associated with synaptic vesicles through their interaction with the small GTPase Rab3 [[cite:PUB00085471]]. RIM-BPs play a role in regulating synaptic transmission by serving as adaptors and linking calcium channels with the synaptic vesicle release machinery [[cite:PUB00085473]]. RIM-BPs contain three SH3 domains and two to three fibronectin III repeats. Invertebrates contain one, while vertebrates contain at least two RIM-BPs, RIM-BP1 and RIM-BP2. RIM-BP1 is also called peripheral-type benzodiazapine receptor associated protein 1 (PRAX-1). Mammals contain a third protein, RIM-BP3 [[cite:PUB00085470]]. RIM-BP1 and RIM-BP2 are predominantly expressed in the brain where they display overlapping but distinct expression patterns, while RIM-BP3 is almost exclusively expressed in the testis and is essential in spermiogenesis [[cite:PUB00085472]]. The SH3 domains of RIM-BPs bind to the PxxP motifs of RIM1, RIM2, and L-type (alpha1D) and N-type (alpha1B) calcium channel subunits [[cite:PUB00085470]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4z8a", "name" "SH3-III of Drosophila Rim-binding protein bound to a Cacophony derived peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14234" "RIM BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RIMS-binding protein 1/2/3", "short" "RIMBP1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 980, "taxa" 3859, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5928, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5928, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1460}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040325", :literature {"PUB00085473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6062", "authors" ["Liu KS" "Siebert M" "Mertel S" "Knoche E" "Wegener S" "Wichmann C" "Matkovic T" "Muhammad K" "Depner H" "Mettke C" "Buckers J" "Hell SW" "Muller M" "Davis GW" "Schmitz D" "Sigrist SJ."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1212991", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "RIM-binding protein, a central part of the active zone, is essential for neurotransmitter release.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1565-9", "volume" "334", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22174254}, "PUB00085479" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Galiegue S" "Jbilo O" "Combes T" "Bribes E" "Carayon P" "Le Fur G" "Casellas P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
