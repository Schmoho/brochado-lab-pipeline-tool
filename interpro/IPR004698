{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of the zinc (Zn2+)-Iron (Fe2+) permease (ZIP) family consist of proteins with eight putative transmembrane spanners. They are derived from animals, plants and yeast. They comprise a diverse family, with several paralogues in any one organism (e.g., at least five in Caenorhabditis elegans, at least five in Arabidopsis thaliana and two in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast). The two S. cerevisiae proteins, Zrt1 and Zrt2, both probably transport Zn2+ with high specificity, but Zrt1 transports Zn2+ with ten-fold higher affinity than Zrt2. Some members of the ZIP family have been shown to transport Zn2+ while others transport Fe2+, and at least one transports a range of metal ions. The energy source for transport has not been characterised, but these systems probably function as secondary carriers.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00820" "ZIP zinc/iron transport family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc/iron permease, fungal/plant", "short" "Zn/Fe_permease_fun/pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1341, "taxa" 3970, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6993, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4252}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004698", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005385", "name" "zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0071577", "name" "zinc ion transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003689", "name" "Zinc/iron permease", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004698", "name" "Zinc/iron permease, fungal/plant", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023498", "name" "Zinc transporter ZupT", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045891", "name" "Zinc transporter ZIP9", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
