{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>An impressive property of mussels is their ability to stick to wet surfaces. Exactly how they do this is unclear, but they are known to exploit bundles of threads, each of which has a fibrous collagenous core coated with adhesive proteins [[cite:PUB00006120]]. These proteins are able to displace water from a wet surface and then set to form tight junctions. The adhesive protein of Mytilus coruscus (Sea mussel) contains 848 amino acids, including a 20-residue signal peptide, a 21-residue non-repetitive linker and a repetitive domain that constitutes the bulk of the protein. The representative repeat motif of this domain, YKPK(I/P)(S/T)YPP(T/S), is similar to that of Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel). The codon usage patterns for the same amino acids differ in different positions of the decapeptide motif [[cite:PUB00006120], [cite:PUB00006130]]. Almost identical nucleotide sequences appear several times in the repetitive region, suggesting that mussel adhesive protein genes have evolved through repeat duplication [[cite:PUB00006130]]. The repeat motif is reminiscent of repeat units found in extensins, a group of plant proteins involved in the strengthening of the cell wall in response to mechanical stress.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01216" "ADHESIVEI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adhesive plaque protein", "short" "Adhesive_plaq"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 274, "sets" 0, "proteins" 91, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002964", :literature {"PUB00006120" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Inoue K" "Odo S."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
