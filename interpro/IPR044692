{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes WPP domain-containing proteins 1/2/3 (also known as MFP1 attachment factors 1/2/3), homologues of the MFP1 attachment factor 1 (MAF1), a plant-specific nuclear envelope (NE)-associated protein first identified in tomato. These proteins are NE-associated proteins containing a WPP domain predicted to consist of a β-strand and three α-helices, sufficient for NE targeting [[cite:PUB00057326], [cite:PUB00096852]]. These proteins regulate the mitotic activity in roots and play a role with HSP70-1 in facilitating WIT1 (WPP domain-interacting tail-anchored protein 1) nuclear envelope targeting [[cite:PUB00096852]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038214", "name" "WPP domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34362" "WPP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WPP domain-containing protein 1/2/3", "short" "WPP1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 230, "taxa" 854, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 807, "sets" 0, "proteins" 807, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 482}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044692", :literature {"PUB00057326" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Patel S" "Rose A" "Meulia T" "Dixit R" "Cyr RJ" "Meier I."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.104.026740", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis WPP-domain proteins are developmentally associated with the nuclear envelope and promote cell division.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "3260-73", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15548735}, "PUB00096852" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Brkljacic J" "Zhao Q" "Meier I."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "WPP-domain proteins mimic the activity of the HSC70-1 chaperone in preventing mistargeting of RanGAP1-anchoring protein WIT1.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "142-54", "volume" "151", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19617588}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000278", "name" "mitotic cell cycle", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0048527", "name" "lateral root development", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044692", "name" "WPP domain-containing protein 1/2/3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
