The modified nucleoside 2-thiocytidine (s(2)C) has so far been found in tRNA from archaea and bacteria. The TtcA protein family is characterised by the existence of both a PP-loop and a Cys-X(1)-X(2)-Cys motif in the central region of the protein but can be divided into two distinct groups based on the presence and location of additional Cys-X(1)-X(2)-Cys motifs in terminal regions of the sequence. Mutant analysis showed that both cysteines in this central conserved Cys-X(1)-X(2)-Cys motif are required for the formation of s(2)C [[cite:PUB00044701]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 1 (also known as Ncs6/Tuc1 in budding yeasts) is responsible for 2-thiolation of mcm5S2U at tRNA wobble positions of tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln) [[cite:PUB00069585], [cite:PUB00045305]]. It directly binds tRNAs and probably acts by catalysing adenylation of tRNAs, an intermediate required for 2-thiolation. Its fission yeast homologue, Ctu1 forms a complex with Ctu2 (Ncs2/Tuc2 homologue) and serves as a putative enzyme for the formation of 2-thiouridine [[cite:PUB00069587]]. This family also includes tRNA-5-methyluridine(54) 2-sulfurtransferase, which catalyses the 2-thiolation of 5-methyluridine residue at position 54 in the T loop of tRNAs, leading to 5-methyl-2-thiouridine [[cite:PUB00087328]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004976" "Predicted PP-loop ATPase, YdaO type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA thiolation protein, TtcA/Ctu1 type", "short" "tRNA_thiolation_TtcA_Ctu1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5069, "taxa" 22329, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23579, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22906, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17461}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
