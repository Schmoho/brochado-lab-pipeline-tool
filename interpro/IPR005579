{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cgr1 is involved in nucleolar integrity and is required for processing pre-rRNA for the 60S ribosome subunit. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this protein is conserved and contributes to compartmentalisation of nucleolar constituents [[cite:PUB00008461]]. Cgr1 is a small hydrophilic protein and members of this family are coiled-coil proteins [[cite:PUB00008461]]. Its primary role appears to be in ribosome biogenesis [[cite:PUB00044116], [cite:PUB00044117]]. Expression of CGR1 is also associated with a cessation of yeast cell growth, which is a prerequisite for germination in this organism [[cite:PUB00044117]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03879" "Cgr1 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cgr1-like", "short" "Cgr1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 53, "proteomes" 2403, "taxa" 8187, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3639, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3629, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2343}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005579", :literature {"PUB00008461" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Moy TI" "Boettner D" "Rhodes JC" "Silver PA" "Askew DS."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/148/4/1081", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Identification of a role for Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cgr1p in pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosome subunit synthesis.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1081-90", "volume" "148", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11932453}, "PUB00044116" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sun J" "McFarland M" "Boettner D" "Panepinto J" "Rhodes JC" "Askew DS."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
