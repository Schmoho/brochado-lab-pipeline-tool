{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents E2F binding proteins. E2F transcription factors play an essential role in cell proliferation and apoptosis and their activity is frequently deregulated in human cancers. E2F activity is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, frequently mediated by proteins binding to individual members or a subgroup of the family. E2F-associated phosphoprotein (EAPP)interacts with a subset of E2F factors and influences E2F-dependent promoter activity. EAPP is present throughout the cell cycle but disappears during mitosis [[cite:PUB00044242]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10238" "E2F-associated phosphoprotein"}, "panther" {"PTHR15967" "E2F-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E2F-associated phosphoprotein", "short" "E2F-assoc_phosphoprotein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 39, "proteomes" 1279, "taxa" 4689, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2158, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2070, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1421}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019370", :literature {"PUB00044242" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Novy M" "Pohn R" "Andorfer P" "Novy-Weiland T" "Galos B" "Schwarzmayr L" "Rotheneder H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
