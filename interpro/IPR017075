This enzyme catalyses the transfer of the GMP moiety of GTP to the 5'-end of RNA via an enzyme-GMP covalent reaction intermediate. The mRNA-capping enzyme is composed of two separate chains alpha and beta, respectively a mRNA guanylyltransferase and an RNA 5'-triphosphatase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036959" "mRNA capping enzyme, alpha subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "mRNA capping enzyme, alpha subunit", "short" "mRNA_cap_enzyme_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 889, "taxa" 2460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1271, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1253, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 810}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
