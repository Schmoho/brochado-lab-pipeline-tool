{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Josephin proteins 1 and 2 are deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; peptidase family C86) that contain the Josephin domain, characteristic of the MJD family of DUBs.  Josephin-1 (JOSD1) releases 'Lys-63'-linked and 'Lys-48'-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, provided it is monoubiquitinated itself.  Josephin-2 (JOSD2) releases 'Lys-63'-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, but does not require ubiquitination to be active.  Ubiquitinated JOSD1 is localized to the plasma membrane, whereas JOSD2 is cytoplasmic [[cite:PUB00090467]].  Josephin-like proteins are also found in Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13291" "JOSEPHIN 1, 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Josephin-1/2", "short" "JOSD1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1375, "taxa" 5368, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2978, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2978, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1987}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
