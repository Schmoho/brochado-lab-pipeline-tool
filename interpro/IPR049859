{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents HTH-type transcriptional regulator LrpA1 from Halobacterium salinarum and similar proteins specific to halobacteria. LrpA1 functions as a transcription factor, overseeing the regulation of genes associated with amino acid metabolism. It suppresses the aspB3 gene, responsible for encoding an aspartate transaminase, particularly in the presence of L-aspartate. Additionally, it influences the basal transcriptional regulator TfbB. Furthermore, LrpA1 demonstrates binding activity to its own promoter [[cite:PUB00106373]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041395" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator LrpA1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator LrpA1", "short" "LrpA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 120, "taxa" 568, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 409, "sets" 0, "proteins" 409, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 361}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049859", :literature {"PUB00106373" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Schwaiger R" "Schwarz C" "Furtwangler K" "Tarasov V" "Wende A" "Oesterhelt D."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Mol Biol", "title" "Transcriptional control by two leucine-responsive regulatory proteins in Halobacterium salinarum R1.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "40", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20509863}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019888", "name" "Transcription regulator AsnC-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR049859", "name" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator LrpA1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
