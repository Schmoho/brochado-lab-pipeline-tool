{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the fused gamma-beta organisation typified by the H. pylori alpha subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Urease (urea amidohydrolase, [ec:3.5.1.5]) is a nickel-dependent metalloenzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. Nickel-dependent ureases are found in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants. Their primary role is to allow the use of external and internally-generated urea as a nitrogen source. The enzyme consists of three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which can exist as separate proteins or can be fused on a single protein chain. The α-β-γ heterotrimer forms multimers, mainly trimers. The subunit composition of urease from different sources varies [[cite:PUB00010725]], but each holoenzyme consists of four domains [[cite:PUB00005206]]: three structural domains and a nickel-binding catalytic domain common to amidohydrolases [[cite:PUB00004994]].</p>\n\n<p>In Klebsiella aerogenes, urease exists as an alpha, beta and gamma subunit, with the alpha subunit possessing the catalytic domain. In Helicobacter pylori, the gamma and beta subunits are fused and called the alpha subunit, while the catalytic subunit is called the beta subunit. In Canavalia ensiformis, urease has a fused gamma-beta-alpha organisation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6zja", "name" "Helicobacter pylori urease with inhibitor bound in the active site"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01955" "Urease subunit alpha [ureA]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001225" "Urease, fused gamma/beta subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urease, gamma-beta subunit", "short" "Urease_gamma-beta_su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 473, "taxa" 2142, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1838, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1837, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1389}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
