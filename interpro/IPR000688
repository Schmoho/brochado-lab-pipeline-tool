{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial membrane-bound nickel-dependent hydrogenases require a number of accessory proteins which are involved in their maturation [[cite:PUB00000659], [cite:PUB00154481]]. One of these proteins is generally known as HypA. HypA is a metallochaperone that binds nickel to bring it safely to its target. The nickel coordinates with four nitrogens within the protein. Four conserved cysteines towards the C terminus bind one zinc moiety, probably to stabilise the protein fold [[cite:PUB00088187]]. In Helicobacter pylori, HypA is involved in the maturation of both hydrogenase and urease [[cite:PUB00014664]]. Escherichia coli has two proteins that belong to this family, HypA and HybF [[cite:PUB00014665]]. A homologue, MJ0214, has also been found in a number of archaeal species, including the genome of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii). Guanidine hydrolase-activating protein A (GhaA) from Synechocystis sp. is also included in this entry, as it shows similarity to HypA. GhaA is involved in the maturation of the nickel-dependent guanidine hydrolase GdmH [[cite:PUB00154481]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5aun", "name" "Crystal structure of the HypAB-Ni complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004761" "[NiFe]-hydrogenase maturation factor, HypA/HybF type"}, "panther" {"PTHR34535" "HYDROGENASE MATURATION FACTOR HYPA"}, "hamap" {"MF_00213" "Hydrogenase maturation factor HypA [hypA]"}, "pfam" {"PF01155" "Hydrogenase/urease nickel incorporation, metallochaperone, hypA"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00100" "hydrogenase maturation nickel metallochaperone HypA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydrogenase maturation factor HypA/HybF", "short" "HypA/HybF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 24, "proteomes" 2480, "taxa" 12501, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14642, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14637, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11223}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00962", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00962"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000688", :literature {"PUB00000659" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Fu C" "Maier RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
