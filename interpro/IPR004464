The crystal structure of GlpX has been determined in a free state and in the complex with a substrate (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) or inhibitor (phosphate).  The crystal structure of the ligand-free GlpX revealed a compact, globular shape with two α/β-sandwich domains. The core fold of GlpX is structurally similar to that of Li+-sensitive phosphatases suggesting that they have a common evolutionary origin and catalytic mechanism. The structure of the GlpX complex with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate revealed that the active site is located between two domains and accommodates several conserved residues coordinating two metal ions and the substrate. A third metal ion is bound to phosphate 6 of the substrate. Inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited activity of both GlpX and YggF, and the crystal structure of the GlpX complex with phosphate demonstrated that the inhibitor molecule binds to the active site.  Alanine replacement mutagenesis of GlpX identifies 12 conserved residues important for activity and suggested that Thr(90) is the primary catalytic residue [[cite:PUB00046483]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>A number of the proteins in this entry, particularly those from algae are bi functional and can catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, respectively.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3d1r", "name" "Structure of E. coli GlpX with its substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01516" "FBPase_glpX"}, "panther" {"PTHR30447" "FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE CLASS 2"}, "pfam" {"PF03320" "Bacterial fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glpX-encoded"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00330" "class II fructose-bisphosphatase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004532" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, GlpX type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase class 2/Sedoheputulose-1,7-bisphosphatase", "short" "FBPase_class-2/SBPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 27, "proteomes" 4530, "taxa" 16815, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14775}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"} {"accession" "GenProp1407", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1407"} {"accession" "GenProp1344", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1344"} {"accession" "GenProp1306", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1306"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
