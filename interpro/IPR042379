{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1), also known as PD1, is an immune-checkpoint receptor mainly expressed by T cells that negatively regulates immune response [[cite:PUB00092923]].

The PD1-mediated inhibitory pathway is exploited by some tumours to attenuate anti-tumour immunity and escape destruction by the immune system [[cite:PUB00092923]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6k0y", "name" "Study of the interactions of a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb059c, with the hPD-1 receptor"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15264" "PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Programmed cell death protein 1", "short" "PDCD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 501, "taxa" 1647, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 704, "sets" 0, "proteins" 704, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 517}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042379", :literature {"PUB00092922" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Fife BT" "Pauken KE."], "ISO_journal" "Ann.
