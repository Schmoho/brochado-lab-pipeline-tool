{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzymes that catalyse histone methylation are classified into 3 families: the PRMT (protein arginine N-methyltransferase) family, the SET-domain-containing family, and the non-SET domain proteins. Lysine 79 (K79) of H3 is methylated by a methyltransferase represented in this entry that lacks a SET domain [[cite:PUB00072846]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H3K79 methylation occurs in a variety of organisms ranging from yeast to human. In budding yeast, K79 methylation is mediated by the silencing protein Dot1 [[cite:PUB00072847]]. Dot1 homologues can be found in a variety of eukaryotic organisms; in mammals the homologous protein is called Dot1-like protein (DOT1L) [[cite:PUB00033352], [cite:PUB00072848]]. Dot1/DOT1L catalyses the sequential mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of H3K79, while SET domain-containing methyltransferases mediate methylation in a processive manner [[cite:PUB00072849]]. K79 methylation level is regulated throughout the cell cycle and plays a critical role in the progression of G1 phase, S phase, mitosis, and meiosis [[cite:PUB00072845]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6te6", "name" "Crystal structure of Dot1L in complex with an inhibitor (compound 3)."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21451" "HISTONE H3 METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone H3-K79 methyltransferase", "short" "H3-K79_meTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 49, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2272, "taxa" 7785, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5594, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5594, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2575}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
