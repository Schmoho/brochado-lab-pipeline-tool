{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The variable portion of the genes encoding immunoglobulins and T cell receptors are assembled from component V, D, and J DNA segments by a site-specific recombination reaction termed V(D)J recombination. V(D)J recombination is targeted to specific sites on the chromosome by recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that flank antigen receptor gene segments. The RSS consists of a conserved heptamer (consensus, 5'-CACAGTG-3') and nonamer (consensus, 5'-ACAAAAACC-3') separated by a spacer of either 12 or 23 bp. Efficient recombination occurs between a 12-RSS and a 23-RSS, a restriction known as the 12/23 rule.</p>\n\n<p>V(D)J recombination can be divided into two phases, DNA cleavage and DNA joining. DNA cleavage requires two lymphocyte-specific factors, the products of the recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2, which together recognise the RSSs and create double strand breaks at the RSS-coding segment junctions [[cite:PUB00007505]]. RAG-mediated DNA cleavage occurs in a synaptic complex termed the paired complex, which is constituted from two distinct RSS-RAG complexes, a 12-SC and a 23-SC (where SC stands for signal complex). The DNA cleavage reaction involves two distinct enzymatic steps, initial nicking that creates a 3'-OH between a coding segment and its RSS, followed by hairpin formation in which the newly created 3'-OH attacks a phosphodiester bond on the opposite DNA strand. This generates a blunt, 5' phosphorylated signal end containing all of the RSS elements, and a covalently sealed hairpin coding end.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v89", "name" "Crystal structure of RAG2-PHD finger in complex with H3K4me3 peptide at 1.1A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015915", "name" "Kelch-type beta propeller", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011043", "name" "Galactose oxidase/kelch, beta-propeller", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03089" "Recombination activating protein 2"}, "panther" {"PTHR10960" "V D J RECOMBINATION-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "V-D-J recombination activating protein 2", "short" "RAG2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 44, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 613, "taxa" 13937, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14368, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14352, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10261}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004321", :literature {"PUB00007505" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6882", "authors" ["Fugmann SD."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/416691a", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "DNA repair: breaking the seal.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "691-4", "volume" "416", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11961538}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006310", "name" "DNA recombination", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004321", "name" "V-D-J recombination activating protein 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 616}}}
