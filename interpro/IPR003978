{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Megakaryocytes are large cells found in the bone marrow that, upon maturation, fragment into platelets. The term thrombopoietin (TPO) was coined in 1958 to describe a possible humoral entity that stimulates megakaryocyte development into platelets. The discovery of a novel haemopoietic cytokine receptor encoded by the proto-oncogene c-mpl raised speculation that this was the receptor for thrombopoietin, and prompted a search for the endogenous ligand [[cite:PUB00008331]]. The ligand was cloned and in vivo- administration of the recombinant protein to mice produced a 4-fold increase in circulating platelets. These results suggested that the c-mpl ligand was in fact thrombopoietin [[cite:PUB00008332]].</p>\n\n<p>More recent studies have shown that TPO is expressed in hepatocytes, the renal proximal tubules, muscle cells and stromal cells in haemopoietic organs [[cite:PUB00008333]]. TPO is a 332-residue protein with a 2-domain structure. The domain at the N terminus is 153 amino acids long, shares similarity with erythropoietin and can itself stimulate megakaryopoiesis in vitro. A four- Î±-helical structure is predicted, which is typical of many haemopoietic regulators. The C-terminal domain is 179 amino acids long, is highly variable across species and is not required for the binding of c-mpl [[cite:PUB00008334]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10560" "THROMBOPOIETIN"}, "prints" {"PR01485" "THROMBOPTN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thrombopoietin", "short" "Thrombopoietin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 571, "taxa" 1941, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1012, "sets" 0, "proteins" 972, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 652}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003978", :literature {"PUB00008331" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kaushansky K."], "ISO_journal" "Bioessays", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199904)21:4<353::AID-BIES12>3.3.CO;2-G", "medline_journal" "Bioessays", "title" "The enigmatic megakaryocyte gradually reveals its secrets.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "353-60", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10377897}, "PUB00008332" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6481", "authors" ["Lok S" "Kaushansky K" "Holly RD" "Kuijper JL" "Lofton-Day CE" "Oort PJ" "Grant FJ" "Heipel MD" "Burkhead SK" "Kramer JM."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/369565a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Cloning and expression of murine thrombopoietin cDNA and stimulation of platelet production in vivo.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "565-8", "volume" "369", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8202158}, "PUB00008333" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Alexander WS."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
