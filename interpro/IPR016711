{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the fungal Sds23 protein, also known as Moc1 or Psp1. The exact function of this protein is not known but it is thought to be required for proper DNA replication and mitosis [[cite:PUB00042667], [cite:PUB00042668]]. It has also been shown to induce sexual development [[cite:PUB00042669], [cite:PUB00074617]] and is involved in the response to nutrient deprivation stress [[cite:PUB00074618]]. Phosphorylation seems to be important in regulating the activity of Sds23 - in actively growing cells the protein is predominatly dephosphorylated while in stationary phase the predominant form is phosphorylated. The Cdc2-Cdc13 complex has been shown to phosphorylate the protein in vitro [[cite:PUB00042668]].</p>\r\n<p>S. cerevisiae has homologues (Sds23 and Sds24) of the S. pombe Sds23 protein [[cite:PUB00074616]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF018148" "Uncharacterised protein with CBS domain pairs, YBR214w type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sds23", "short" "Ssd23"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 567, "taxa" 1537, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 842, "sets" 0, "proteins" 831, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 537}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016711", :literature {"PUB00042667" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Ishii K" "Kumada K" "Toda T" "Yanagida M."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=8978689&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Requirement for PP1 phosphatase and 20S cyclosome/APC for the onset of anaphase is lessened by the dosage increase of a novel gene sds23+.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "6629-40", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8978689}, "PUB00042668" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Jang YJ" "Won M" "Chung KS" "Kim DU" "Hoe KL" "Park C" "Yoo HS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
