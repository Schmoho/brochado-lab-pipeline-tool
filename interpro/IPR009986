{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains the bacterial Sigma factor-binding protein Crl. This is a transcriptional regulator of the csgA curlin subunit gene for curli fibres that are found on the surface of certain bacteria [[cite:PUB00013139]]. These proteins bind to the sigma-S subunit of RNA polymerase, activating expression of sigma-S-regulated genes. It was initially suggested that Crl affects transcription initiation in vitro by other sigmas, such as sigma-70 and sigma-32. However, it is now established that Crl binds specifically to the alternative sigma factor S/RpoS and favors its association with the core RNAP (RNA polymerase), thereby increasing its activity, which in turn regulates general stress response that protects many Gram-negative bacteria from several harmful environmental conditions. Furthermore, sigma S factor/RpoS plays important roles in biofilm formation and virulence of the food-borne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [[cite:PUB00091054]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4q11", "name" "Crystal structure of Proteus mirabilis transcriptional regulator protein Crl at 1.95A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038208", "name" "Sigma factor-binding protein Crl superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07417" "Sigma factor-binding transcriptional regulator Crl"}, "hamap" {"MF_01178" "Sigma factor-binding protein Crl [crl]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sigma factor-binding transcriptional regulator Crl", "short" "Tscrpt_reg_Crl"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 208, "taxa" 1641, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1633, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1266}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009986", :literature {"PUB00013139" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Arnqvist A" "Olsen A" "Pfeifer J" "Russell DG" "Normark S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
