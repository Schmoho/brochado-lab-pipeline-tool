In yeast, this enzyme catalyzes the second two steps of the methylation pathway of phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis, the SAM-dependent methylation of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME) to phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDME) and of PDME to PC. In vertebrates, it catalyzes the three sequential steps of the methylation pathway of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, the SAM-dependent methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME), PMME to phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDME), and PDME to PC.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03216" "Phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine N-methyltransferase [PEMT]"}, "profile" {"PS51599" "Phospholipid methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.17 and EC=2.1.1.71) family profile"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005444" "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase/Methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase"}, "panther" {"PTHR15458" "PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine/Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase", "short" "PEMT/MFAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2133, "taxa" 6911, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3554, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3552, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2327}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
