{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this uncharacterised protein family are all small, extending 70 or fewer residues from their respective likely start codon. All have the twin-arginine-dependent transport (TAT) signal sequence at the N terminus and a conserved 20-residue C-terminal region that includes the motif Y-[HRK]-X-[TS]-X-H-[IV]-X-X-[YF]-Y. The TAT signal sequence suggests a bound cofactor. All members are encoded near genes for subunits of format dehydrogenase, and may themselves be a subunit or accessory protein of another protein complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036704" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP036704 type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02811" "formate dehydrogenase region TAT target"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative formate dehydrogenase, TAT signal-containing", "short" "Formate_DH_TAT-contain"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 502, "taxa" 2140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2039, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2038, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1561}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014177", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014177", "name" "Putative formate dehydrogenase, TAT signal-containing", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
