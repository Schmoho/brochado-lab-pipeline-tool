{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a large set of plasmodium proteins found in high copy number in subtelomeric repeats, including Fam-L and Fam-M proteins [[cite:PUB00151585]]. It has been suggested that these proteins may pair to form heterodimers [[cite:PUB00151585]]. Structure prediction suggests these proteins are related to RH5 and therefore may also have an adhesion role, possibly binding host receptors [[cite:PUB00151585]].
