{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is composed of a ten-subunit core and an Rpb4-Rpb7 heterodimer that reversibly associates with the core [[cite:PUB00010734]]. The heterodimer both binds RNA and serves to stabilise the transcription complex. The Rpb4 and Rpb7 homologues in Archaea are known as subunits F and E, and have been more recently renamed as Rpo4 and Rpo7, respectively [[cite:PUB00059148]]. While the Rpb7 homologue is reasonably well conserved, the similarity between the eukaryotic Rpb4 and the archaeal F subunit is barely detectable at the primary sequence level [[cite:PUB00007873], [cite:PUB00010735]]. Like their eukaryotic counterparts, the archaeal E and F subunits have been shown to form a stable heterodimer [[cite:PUB00010736]]. Structural studies of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) E-F heterodimer indicate that subunit E likely mediates binding to the nascent RNA transcript, while the F subunit serves to stabilise the conformation of the E subunit [[cite:PUB00010736]].</p>\n\n<p>This family represents the archaeal subunit Rpo4 (subunit F).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>DNA-directed RNA polymerases, also known as DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, are responsible for the polymerisation of ribonucleotides into a sequence complementary to the template DNA.
