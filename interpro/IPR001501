{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyse the reversible oxidation of hydrogen and are important in anaerobic metabolism. There are various types of metal-containing hydrogenases and can be broadly divided into three groups: Fe ('iron only') hydrogenases; Ni-Fe hydrogenases; and Ni-Fe-Se hydrogenases [[cite:PUB00001739]].</p>\n\n<p>The [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases are heterodimer that consist of a small subunit (S) that contains a signal peptide and a large subunit (L). All the known large subunits seem to be evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00002102], [cite:PUB00099872]]; they contain two Cys-x-x-Cys motifs; one at their N-terminal end; the other at their C-terminal end. These four cysteines are involved in the binding of nickel [[cite:PUB00020978]]. In the [NiFeSe] hydrogenases the first cysteine of the C-terminal motif is a selenocysteine which has experimentally been shown to be a nickel ligand [[cite:PUB00004672]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ehs", "name" "E. coli Hydrogenase-2 chemically reduced structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029014", "name" "[NiFe]-hydrogenase, large subunit", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00374" "Nickel-dependent hydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nickel-dependent hydrogenase, large subunit", "short" "Ni-dep_hyd_lsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 156, "domain_architectures" 40, "proteomes" 2497, "taxa" 13076, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40263, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28592, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22112}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00400", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00400"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1209", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1209"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
