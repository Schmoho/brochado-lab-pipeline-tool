{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (8ODP, also known as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatase and MHT1),  and similar Nudix hydrolase domain-containing proteins from bacteria, eukaryots and archaea. This protein has a significant hydrolase activity toward 2-oxo-ATP, 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-dATP and catalyzes the hydrolysis of methylated purine nucleoside triphosphate preventing their integration into DNA [[cite:PUB00099627], [cite:PUB00099626], [cite:PUB00008130]]. It was originally considered to play an important role as sanitizer of the oxidized nucleotide pool [[cite:PUB00008130], [cite:PUB00099629]]. However, later studies indicate that NUDT1 plays a redundant role in eliminating oxidized nucleotides and that it is not essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival [[cite:PUB00099628], [cite:PUB00099630]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6jvo", "name" "Crystal structure of human MTH1 in complex with compound MI1022"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01403" "8OXTPHPHTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphate", "short" "8ODP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 113, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1416, "taxa" 6033, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16844, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3434, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2472}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
