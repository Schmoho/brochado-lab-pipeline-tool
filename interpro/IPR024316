{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of conserved fungal proteins involved in nuclear pore assembly [[cite:PUB00055992]]. APQ12 is an integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope (NE) and endoplasmic reticulum. Its absence leads to a partial block in mRNA export and cold-sensitive defects in the growth and localisation of a subset of nucleoporins, particularly those asymmetrically localised to the cytoplasmic fibrils [[cite:PUB00055993]]. The defects in nuclear pore assembly appear to be due to defects in regulating membrane fluidity [[cite:PUB00055994]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12716" "Nuclear pore assembly and biogenesis"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear pore assembly and biogenesis protein, APQ12", "short" "APQ12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 642, "taxa" 1696, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 940, "sets" 0, "proteins" 940, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 597}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024316", :literature {"PUB00055992" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Baker KE" "Coller J" "Parker R."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1261/rna.7420504", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "The yeast Apq12 protein affects nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1352-8", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15273328}, "PUB00055993" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Scarcelli JJ" "Hodge CA" "Cole CN."], "ISO_journal" "J.
