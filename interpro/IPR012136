{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NAD(P) transhydrogenase catalyses the transfer of reducing equivalents between NAD(H) and NADP(H), coupled to the translocation of protons across a membrane [[cite:PUB00033266]]. It is an integral membrane protein found in the inner membrane of animal mitochondria and in bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Under most physiological conditions this enzyme synthesises NADPH, driven by consumption of the proton electrochemical gradient. The resulting NADPH is subsequently used for biosynthetic reactions or the reduction of glutathione.</p>\n\n<p>The global structure of this enzyme is similar in all organisms, consisting of three distinct domains, though the polypeptide composition can vary. Domain I binds NAD(+)/NADH, domain II is a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, and domain III binds NADP(+)/NADPH. Domain I is composed of two subdomains, both of which form a Rossman fold, while domain III consists of a single Rossman fold where the NADP(+) is flipped relative to the normal orientation of bound nucleotides within the Rossman fold [[cite:PUB00024810], [cite:PUB00024417], [cite:PUB00022476]]. Several residues within these domains are thought to make functionally important interdomain contacts for hydride transfer between these domains [[cite:PUB00025858]]. Proton translocation occurs through domain II and is thought to induce conformational changes which are transmitted across domain III to the site of hydride transfer between domains I and III.</p>\n\n<p>NAD(P) transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli contains an alpha subunit with the NAD(H)-binding domain I and a beta subunit with the NADP(H)-binding domain III. The membrane domain (domain II) harbors the proton channel and is made up of the hydrophobic parts of the alpha and beta subunits [[cite:PUB00083188]]. This entry represents the beta subunit found in bacterial two-subunit NADP(H) transhydrogenases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000204" "NAD(P) transhydrogenase, beta subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADP transhydrogenase, beta subunit", "short" "NADH_DH_b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4480, "taxa" 17873, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19956, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19923, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15400}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1305", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1305"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
