{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is found in the jellyfish (Aequorea victoria), and functions as an energy-transfer acceptor. It fluoresces<i>in vivo</i>upon receiving energy from the \r\nCa<sup>2+</sup>-activated photoprotein aequorin. The protein absorbs light maximally at 395 nm and exhibits a smaller absorbance peak at 470 nm. The fluorescence emission spectrum peaks at 509 nm with a shoulder at 540 nm. The protein is produced in the photocytes and contains a chromophore, which is composed of modified amino acid residues. The chromophore is formed upon cyclisation of the residues ser-dehydrotyr-gly. There are several other members of the GFP family, which are able to fluoresce different colours, sveral of which are non-fluorescent [[cite:PUB00020645]]. These proteins are all essentailly encoded by single genes, since both the substrate and the catalytic enzyme for pigment biosynthesis are provided within a single polypeptide chain [[cite:PUB00020644]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ni3", "name" "sfGFP 204-204 mutant dimer"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009017", "name" "Green fluorescent protein", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01229" "GFLUORESCENT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Green fluorescent protein, GFP", "short" "Green_fluorescent_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1090, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 469, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 249, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 204}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000786", :literature {"PUB00020645" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Lukyanov KA" "Fradkov AF" "Gurskaya NG" "Matz MV" "Labas YA" "Savitsky AP" "Markelov ML" "Zaraisky AG" "Zhao X" "Fang Y" "Tan W" "Lukyanov SA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
