PhzF is part of the seven-gene operon phzABCDEFG, responsible for the synthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) in Pseudomonas species [[cite:PUB00106522]]. PhzF is a trans-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilate isomerase that catalyses the condensation of two molecules of trans-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA) into the phenazine ring system.
