{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Copines are a widely distributed class of Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding proteins. Most have a characteristic domain structure: two C2 domains in the N-terminal region and a von Willebrand A (VWA) domain in the C-terminal region. They are potentially involved in membrane trafficking, protein-protein interactions, and perhaps even cell division and growth [[cite:PUB00081806], [cite:PUB00012971]]. In plants, they are known as BONZAI proteins [[cite:PUB00087586]]. The copine family in plants may have effects in promoting growth and development in addition to repressing cell death [[cite:PUB00074686], [cite:PUB00074680]]. Caenorhabditis elegans copine, also known as Nra1, is Involved in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-mediated sensitivity to nicotine and levamisole [[cite:PUB00086578]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6kxt", "name" "BON1-C2B"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10857" "COPINE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Copine", "short" "Copine"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1318, "taxa" 5156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18039, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18039, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10784}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045052", :literature {"PUB00074686" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Hua J" "Grisafi P" "Cheng SH" "Fink GR."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.918101", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Plant growth homeostasis is controlled by the Arabidopsis BON1 and BAP1 genes.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2263-72", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11544183}, "PUB00074680" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yang S" "Yang H" "Grisafi P" "Sanchatjate S" "Fink GR" "Sun Q" "Hua J."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02585.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The BON/CPN gene family represses cell death and promotes cell growth in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "166-79", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16367962}, "PUB00012971" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Tomsig JL" "Creutz CE."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
