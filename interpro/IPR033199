This way DDAH relieves the inhibition of NOS and promotes NO biosynthesis. Therefore, DDAH1 protects against cardiovascular disease by metabolising the risk factor ADMA, being a target for ADMA-lowering therapies [[cite:PUB00151561]].</p>\n\n<p>Two isoforms exist, DDAH1 and DDAH2, encoded by different genes and have 50% identity in their amino acid sequences. Both proteins are widely expressed in multiple tissues at high levels in endothelial cells, kidney, and liver, with DDAH1 being more abundant in tissues that express neuronal NOS [[cite:PUB00078127]] and DDAH2 is more abundant highly vascularized tissues that express the endothelial NOS isoform (heart, lungs, and placenta) and in immune tissues that can express iNOS [[cite:PUB00078133], [cite:PUB00151561]]. DDAH2 is incapable of metabolising ADMA and its substrate is currently unknown, and it may be a drug target through an ADMA-independent pathway with biological effects in regulation of angiogenesis, diabetes, and immune responses [[cite:PUB00151561]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ci1", "name" "Crystal Structure of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase I in complex with S-nitroso-Lhomocysteine"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12737" "DIMETHYLARGININE DIMETHYLAMINOHYDROLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-like", "short" "DDAH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2472, "taxa" 10219, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9001, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9001, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6505}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
