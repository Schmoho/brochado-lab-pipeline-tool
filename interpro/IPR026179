{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of SLAIN motif-containing proteins, including SLAIN1 and SLAIN2. SLAIN1 was named after the SLAIN amino acid stretch in its C terminus. It is expressed at the stem cell and epiblast stages of ESC differentiation and in the epiblast, nervous system, tailbud and somites of the developing embryo in mice [[cite:PUB00060165]]. SLAIN2 has been shown to bind to the plus end of microtubules and to regulate microtubule dynamics and organisation. It promotes cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation and elongation. It is required for normal structure of the microtubule cytoskeleton during interphase [[cite:PUB00060166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15301" "SLAIN motif-containing family"}, "panther" {"PTHR22406" "NASCENT POLYPEPTIDE-ASSOCIATED COMPLEX SUBUNIT ALPHA, MUSCLE-SPECIFIC FORM"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SLAIN motif-containing protein", "short" "Slain"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 34, "proteomes" 712, "taxa" 2608, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4977, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3743, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2452}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026179", :literature {"PUB00060165" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hirst CE" "Ng ES" "Azzola L" "Voss AK" "Thomas T" "Stanley EG" "Elefanty AG."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
