{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) [[cite:PUB00000034], [cite:PUB00004038]] catalyses the initial step in Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle in plants as well as purple and green bacteria. It catalyzes the primary CO2 fixation step. Rubisco is activated by carbamylation of an active site lysine, stabilized by a divalent cation, which then catalyzes the proton abstraction from the substrate ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate (RuBP) and leads to the formation of two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate [[cite:PUB00015291], [cite:PUB00020282]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Members of the Rubisco family can be divided into 4 subgroups, form I-IV , which differ in their taxonomic distribution and subunit composition [[cite:PUB00080670], [cite:PUB00049187]].
