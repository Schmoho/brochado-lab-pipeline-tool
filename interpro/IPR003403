{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This regulatory protein is expressed from an immediate early gene in the cell cycle of Herpesviridae. The protein is known by various names including IE-68, US1, ICP22 and IR4. It acts as a general transcriptional regulator of cellular and viral mRNAs, through modifications on the host RNA polymerase II which inhibit host genome transcription, leading to cell cycle deregulation and loss of efficient antiviral response. IE68 also recruits cellular transcription elongation factors to viral genomes for efficient transcription elongation of viral genes [[cite:PUB00095593], [cite:PUB00095595]]. In Herpesvirus type-2, this protein functions as a E3 ubiquitin ligase which interacts with STAT1, STAT2, IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), and other ubiquitinated proteins, promoting its degradation and resulting in the blockade of ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) nuclear translocation. Through this mechanism, the production of ISG54 is inhibited and, thus, it inhibits innate immunity response during viral infection [[cite:PUB00095594]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02479" "Herpesvirus immediate early protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus immediate early protein", "short" "IE68"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 310, "sets" 0, "proteins" 310, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003403", :literature {"PUB00095593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Fraser KA" "Rice SA."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Herpes simplex virus immediate-early protein ICP22 triggers loss of serine 2-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "5091-101", "volume" "81", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17344289}, "PUB00095595" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Fox HL" "Dembowski JA" "DeLuca NA."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "A Herpesviral Immediate Early Protein Promotes Transcription Elongation of Viral Transcripts.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28611249}, "PUB00095594" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zhang M" "Fu M" "Li M" "Hu H" "Gong S" "Hu Q."], "ISO_journal" "J Immunol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Immunol", "title" "Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Inhibits Type I IFN Signaling Mediated by the Novel E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Activity of Viral Protein ICP22.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1281-1292", "volume" "205", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32699158}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010468", "name" "regulation of gene expression", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003403", "name" "Herpesvirus immediate early protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 30}}}
