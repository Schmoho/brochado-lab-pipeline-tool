{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD7 (also known as SET7/9) ([ec:2.1.1.364]), which contains a SET domain [[cite:PUB00044656], [cite:PUB00103776]]. This enzyme specifically monomethylate Lys-4 of histone H3, thereby creating a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. Methylation of lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of histones is thought to represent an important component of the mechanism that regulates chromatin structure. As such SETD7 plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of genes such as collagenase and insulin. It is recruited by IPF1/PDX-1 to the insulin promoter, leading to activate transcription [[cite:PUB00103776]]. SETD7 also has methyltransferase activity toward non-histone proteins, including TAF10 and p53/TP53. SETD7 monomethylates Lys-189 of TAF10, which increases the affinity of TAF10 for RNA polymerase II. SETD7 monomethylates Lys-372 of p53/TP53, which stabilises p53/TP53 and increases p53/TP53-mediated transcriptional activation [[cite:PUB00032493], [cite:PUB00040554]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3cbp", "name" "Set7/9-ER-Sinefungin complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51577" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43) family profile"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037249" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase with SET domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD7", "short" "Hist-Lys_N-MeTrfase_SETD7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 627, "taxa" 2168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 902, "sets" 0, "proteins" 902, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 652}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
