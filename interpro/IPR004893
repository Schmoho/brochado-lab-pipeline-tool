{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nitrogenase is a complex metalloenzyme composed of two proteins designated the Fe-protein and the MoFe-protein. Apart from these two proteins, a number of accessory proteins are essential for the maturation and assembly of nitrogenase. Even though experimental evidence suggests that these accessory proteins are required for nitrogenase activity, the exact roles played by many of these proteins in the functions of nitrogenase are unclear [[cite:PUB00007718]]. Using yeast two-hybrid screening it has been shown that NifW can interact with itself as well as NifZ.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00529" "Nitrogenase-stabilizing/protective protein NifW [nifW]"}, "pfam" {"PF03206" "Nitrogen fixation protein NifW"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005790" "Predicted nitrogenase stabilizer NifW"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogen fixation protein NifW", "short" "NifW"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 489, "taxa" 2595, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1888, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1888, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1507}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004893", :literature {"PUB00007718" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lee SH" "Pulakat L" "Parker KC" "Gavini N."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
