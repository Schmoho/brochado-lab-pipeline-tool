{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The two acireductone dioxygenase enzymes (ARD and ARD', previously known as E-2 and E-2') from Klebsiella pneumoniae share the same amino acid sequence [swissprot:Q9ZFE7], but bind different metal ions: ARD binds Ni2+, ARD' binds Fe2+ [[cite:PUB00007489]]. ARD and ARD' can be experimentally interconverted by removal of the bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal ion. The two enzymes share the same substrate, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different products. ARD' yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine salvage pathway that converts 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of the concentration of MTA, which is a powerful inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions [[cite:PUB00007490]]. ARD yields methylthiopropanoate, carbon monoxide and formate, and thus prevents the conversion of MTA to methionine. The role of the ARD catalysed reaction is unclear: methylthiopropanoate is cytotoxic, and carbon monoxide can activate guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cGMP levels [[cite:PUB00007490], [cite:PUB00007489]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5i8t", "name" "Structure of Mouse Acireductone dioxygenase with Ni2+ ion and D-lactic acid in the active site"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23418" "ACIREDUCTONE DIOXYGENASE"}, "cdd" {"cd02232" "acireductone dioxygenase (ARD), cupin domain"}, "pfam" {"PF03079" "ARD/ARD' family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acireductone dioxygenase ARD family", "short" "ARD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 96, "proteomes" 3603, "taxa" 14136, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10950, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10894, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7642}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0729", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0729"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
