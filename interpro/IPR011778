{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydropyrimidinase (DHPase) catalyses the second step of the reductive pyrimidine degradation, the reversible hydrolytic ring opening of dihydropyrimidines [[cite:PUB00054985]]. Primarily converts 5,6-dihydrouracil to N-carbamyl-beta-alanine (also called 3-ureidopropanoate) but also acts on dihydrothymine and hydantoin. The enzyme is a metalloenzyme [[cite:PUB00015455]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the hydantoinase/dihydropyrimidinase family, which also includes D-phenylhydantoinases. This enzyme catalyses the stereospecific hydrolysis of the cyclic amide bond of D-hydantoin derivatives with an aromatic side chains at the 5'-position, and has no activity on dihydropyrimidines [[cite:PUB00054984]].</p>\n\n<p>Dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins (collapsin response mediator proteins, CRMPs) share sequence similarity with liver DHPase. Although purified CRMP does not hydrolyse DHPase substrates, it is likely that a related activity accounts for its participation in neuronal growth cone signaling [[cite:PUB00073380]]. CRMP3 has histone H4 deacetylase activity [[cite:PUB00073343]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gkp", "name" "D-Hydantoinase (Dihydropyrimidinase) from Thermus sp. in space group C2221"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011059", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase, composite domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01314" "D-HYD"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02033" "dihydropyrimidinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydantoinase/dihydropyrimidinase", "short" "Hydantoinase/dihydroPyrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4463, "taxa" 17045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23294, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16068}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1273", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1273"} {"accession" "GenProp1371", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1371"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
