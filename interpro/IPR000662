{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the major capsid protein VP1 (viral protein 1) from Polyomaviruses, such as Murine polyomavirus (strain P16 small-plaque) (MPyV) [[cite:PUB00006154]]. Polyomaviruses are dsDNA viruses with no RNA stage in their life cycle.  The virus capsid is composed of 72 icosahedral units, each of which is composed of five copies of VP1. The virus attaches to the cell surface by recognition of oligosaccharides terminating in alpha(2,3)-linked sialic acid. The capsid protein VP1 forms a pentamer.  The complete capsid is composed of 72 VP1 pentamers, with a minor capsid protein, VP2 or VP3, inserted into the centre of each pentamer like a hairpin. This structure restricts the exposure of internal proteins during viral entry. Polyomavirus coat assembly is rigorously controlled by chaperone-mediated assembly. During viral infection, the heat shock chaperone hsc70 binds VP1 and co-localises it in the nucleus, thereby regulating capsid assembly [[cite:PUB00035621]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7b6a", "name" "BK Polyomavirus VP1 pentamer core (residues 30-299)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011222", "name" "Double-stranded DNA virus, group I, capsid", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036931", "name" "Polyomavirus capsid protein VP1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003376" "Capsid protein VP1, Polyomavirus type"}, "pfam" {"PF00718" "Polyomavirus coat protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Capsid protein VP1,Polyomavirus", "short" "Capsid_VP1_Polyomavir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 100, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 85, "taxa" 393, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000662", :literature {"PUB00035621" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Chromy LR" "Pipas JM" "Garcea RL."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
