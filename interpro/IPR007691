{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents LpxD, an enzyme for the biosynthesis of lipid A, a component oflipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane outer leaflet of most Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences are found between lipid A of different species. This protein represents the third step from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [[cite:PUB00010088]]. The group added at this step generally is 14:0(3-OH) (myristate) but may vary; in Aquifex it appears to be 16:0(3-OH) (palmitate) [[cite:PUB00013504]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lipid A-like molecules in plants may serve as structural components of the outer membranes of mitochondria and/or chloroplasts, or may be involved in signal transduction or plant defense responses [[cite:PUB00080090], [cite:PUB00080096]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6p89", "name" "E.coli LpxD in complex with compound 7"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011004", "name" "Trimeric LpxA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03352" "LbH_LpxD"}, "panther" {"PTHR43378" "UDP-3-O-ACYLGLUCOSAMINE N-ACYLTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00523" "UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoyl)glucosamine N-acyltransferase [lpxD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01853" "UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoyl)glucosamine N-acyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxymyristoyl] glucosamine N-acyltransferase LpxD", "short" "LpxD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5155, "taxa" 22326, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29534, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29531, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22309}, "pathways" 221}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1290", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1290"} {"accession" "GenProp0204", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0204"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
