{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the stationary-phase-induced ribosome-associated protein SRA also known as protein D. This protein was originally thought to be a ribosomal protein [[cite:PUB00016523]]. More recently it was shown that this is a bona fide ribosome hibernation factor that together with the factors Rmf, Hpf and RaiA is bound to the ribosomes during the onset and a few first days of the stationary phase when translation is strongly suppressed. In the prolonged stationary phase, these factors dissociate from the ribosomes [[cite:PUB00151185]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08136" "Ribosome hibernation factor SRA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome hibernation factor SRA", "short" "SRA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 36, "taxa" 640, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 608, "sets" 0, "proteins" 607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 462}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012607", :literature {"PUB00016523" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Maki Y" "Yoshida H" "Wada A."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00389.x", "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Two proteins, YfiA and YhbH, associated with resting ribosomes in stationary phase Escherichia coli.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "965-74", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11168583}, "PUB00151185" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Reier K" "Liiv A" "Remme J."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Ribosome Protein Composition Mediates Translation during the <i>Escherichia coli</i> Stationary Phase.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "3128", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36834540}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006412", "name" "translation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012607", "name" "Ribosome hibernation factor SRA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 31}}}
