{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA topoisomerases regulate the number of topological links between two DNA strands (i.e. change the number of superhelical turns) by catalysing transient single-or double-strand breaks, crossing the strands through one another, then resealing the breaks [[cite:PUB00005437]]. These enzymes have several functions: to remove DNA supercoils during transcription and DNA replication; for strand breakage during recombination; for chromosome condensation; and to disentangle intertwined DNA during mitosis [[cite:PUB00020794], [cite:PUB00016842]].  DNA topoisomerases are divided into two classes: type I enzymes ([ec:5.6.2.2]; topoisomerases I, III and V) break single-strand DNA, and type II enzymes ([ec:5.6.2.2]; topoisomerases II, IV and VI) break double-strand DNA [[cite:PUB00020793]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Type I topoisomerases are ATP-independent enzymes (except for reverse gyrase), and can be subdivided according to their structure and reaction mechanisms: type IA (Topo IA; bacterial and archaeal topoisomerase I, topoisomerase III and reverse gyrase) and type IB (Topo IB; eukaryotic topoisomerase I and topoisomerase V). These enzymes are primarily responsible for relaxing positively and/or negatively supercoiled DNA, except for reverse gyrase, which can introduce positive supercoils into DNA.  This function is vital for the processes of replication, transcription, and recombination. Unlike Topo IA enzymes, Topo IB enzymes do not require a single-stranded region of DNA or metal ions for their function. The type IB family of DNA topoisomerases includes eukaryotic nuclear topoisomerase I, topoisomerases of poxviruses, and bacterial versions of Topo IB [[cite:PUB00081705]]. They belong to the superfamily of DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, which share the same fold in their C-terminal catalytic domain and the overall reaction mechanism with tyrosine recombinases [[cite:PUB00081702], [cite:PUB00005230]]. The C-terminal catalytic domain in topoisomerases is linked to a divergent N-terminal domain that shows no sequence or structure similarity to the N-terminal domains of tyrosine recombinases [[cite:PUB00081703], [cite:PUB00081704]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry describes topoisomerase III from bacteria.

Topoisomerase III requires single-stranded DNA for binding, so it is more efficient at decatenating chromosomes if the DNA circles contain a small gap. It appears that Topoisomerase III works by removing precatenanes, an alternative form that can be taken by the positive linkages that arise between the daughter chromosomes during replication.  Topoisomerase III shows considerable identity to bacterial topoisomerase I, except that it lacks the zinc finger region found in the latter.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023405", "name" "DNA topoisomerase, type IA, core domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013824", "name" "DNA topoisomerase, type IA, central region, subdomain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00953" "DNA topoisomerase 3 [topB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01056" "DNA topoisomerase III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA topoisomerase III", "short" "TopoIII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3025, "taxa" 12831, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19060, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19060, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14748}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
