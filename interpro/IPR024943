{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enhancer of polycomb gene of Drosophila encodes a chromatin protein conserved in yeast and mammals [[cite:PUB00012820]]. The homologous yeast protein, known as enhancer of polycomb-like protein 1 (Epl1), is a subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation of selected genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A [[cite:PUB00056868]]. Epl1 also found in a novel highly active smaller complex named Piccolo NuA4 (picNuA4), which strongly prefers chromatin over free histones as substrate [[cite:PUB00056868]]. The NuA4 HAT complex is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and it plays primary roles in transcription, cellular response to DNA damage, and cell cycle control [[cite:PUB00035439]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents all eukaryotic enhancer of polycomb proteins, including enhancer of polycomb-like proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14898" "ENHANCER OF POLYCOMB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Enhancer of polycomb protein", "short" "Enhancer_polycomb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2570, "taxa" 8577, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8147, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8147, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4579}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024943", :literature {"PUB00056868" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Boudreault AA" "Cronier D" "Selleck W" "Lacoste N" "Utley RT" "Allard S" "Savard J" "Lane WS" "Tan S" "Cote J."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1056603", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Yeast enhancer of polycomb defines global Esa1-dependent acetylation of chromatin.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1415-28", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12782659}, "PUB00035439" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Doyon Y" "Selleck W" "Lane WS" "Tan S" "Cote J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
