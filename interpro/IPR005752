{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rep hexameric DNA helicase contain ATP-binding domains similar to those seen in monomeric helicases but which are arranged in a ring. There is compelling evidence to suggest that a single ssDNA molecule passes through the centre of the hexameric ring. Activity of the enzyme is based upon two separate but coupled activities, ssDNA translocation and duplex destabilisation, and is driven by energy derived from the continuous ATP-binding and hydrolysis events that take place in the active-site cleft. The resulting conformational changes that accompany these events underpin the coupling process and allow the helicase to translocate along the DNA, destabilising the duplex and separating the two strands in an active process [[cite:PUB00007888]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01920" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase Rep [rep]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01074" "DNA helicase Rep"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase Rep", "short" "Helicase_Rep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1529, "taxa" 7153, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7468, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7468, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5826}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1208"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
