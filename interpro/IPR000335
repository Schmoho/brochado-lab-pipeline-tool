{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bleomycin (Blm) is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced naturally by actinomycetes. It is a strong DNA-cutting agent and thus finds use as a potent anti-cancer drug. The DNA-cutting mechanism is complex, involving concomitant oxidation of FeII and reduction of oxygen. In addition to iron, Blm binds other transition metals: cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc. Actinomycetes have developed a defence mechanism against this lethal compound, producing a protein that confers resistance to Blm through drug sequestering. The crystal structure of the bleomycin resistance protein reveals 2 identically-folded halves, each having an α/β fold but showing no sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00001255]]. Each half comprises a 4-stranded β-sheet and a short α-helix (3 turns). The sheets within each half lie roughly at right-angles and are related by an approximate 2-fold axis. The crystal packing shows compact dimers that have a hydrophobic interface and are involved in mutual chain exchange.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qto", "name" "1.5 A CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF A BLEOMYCIN RESISTANCE DETERMINANT FROM BLEOMYCIN-PRODUCING STREPTOMYCES VERTICILLUS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19581" "Glyoxalase superfamily protein"}, "cdd" {"cd08349" "Bleomycin binding protein (BLMA) and similar proteins"}, "prints" {"PR00311" "BLEOMYCINRST"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bleomycin resistance protein", "short" "Bleomycin-R"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 24, "proteomes" 1701, "taxa" 8054, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8273, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6490}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000335", :literature {"PUB00001255" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Dumas P" "Bergdoll M" "Cagnon C" "Masson JM."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=7516875&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis of a bleomycin resistance protein and their significance for drug sequestering.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "2483-92", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7516875}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046677", "name" "response to antibiotic", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000335", "name" "Bleomycin resistance protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 854}}}
