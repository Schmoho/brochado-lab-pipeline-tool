{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development, the features of which include conductive hearing loss and cleft palate [[cite:PUB00007652], [cite:PUB00007653]]; it is the most common of the human mandibulo-facial dysostosis disorders [[cite:PUB00007652]]. The TCS locus has been mapped to human chromosome 5q31.3-32 and the mutated gene identified (TCOF1) [[cite:PUB00007653]]. To date, 35 mutations have been reported in TCOF1, all but one of which result in the introduction of a premature-termination codon into the predicted protein, Treacle. The observed mutational spectrum supports the hypothesis that TCS results from haploinsufficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Treacle is a low complexity protein of 1,411 amino acids whose predicted protein structure contains a set of highly polar repeated motifs [[cite:PUB00007652]]. These motifs are common to nucleolar trafficking proteins in other species and are predicted to be phosphorylated by casein kinase. In concert with this observation, the full-length TCOF1 protein sequence also contains putative nuclear and nucleolar localisation signals [[cite:PUB00007652]]. Throughout the open reading frame are found mutations in TCS families and several polymorphisms. It has thus been suggested that TCS results from defects in a nucleolar trafficking protein that is critically required during human craniofacial development.</p>\n\n<p>This entry contains Treacle and other related proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR20787" "TREACLE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Treacle protein", "short" "Treacle"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 386, "taxa" 1301, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1086, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1086, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017859", :literature {"PUB00007652" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wise CA" "Chiang LC" "Paznekas WA" "Sharma M" "Musy MM" "Ashley JA" "Lovett M" "Jabs EW."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
