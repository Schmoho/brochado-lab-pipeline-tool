{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterised by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. Inward rectifier potassium channel 13 (KCNJ13) has a very low single channel conductance, low sensitivity to block by external barium and cesium, and no dependence of its inward rectification properties on the internal blocking particle magnesium.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014756", "name" "Immunoglobulin E-set", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013518", "name" "Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying, Kir, cytoplasmic", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01679" "KIR7CHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inward rectifier potassium channel 13", "short" "KCNJ13"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 504, "taxa" 1582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2201, "sets" 0, "proteins" 593, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 468}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008062", :literature {"PUB00068055" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hejtmancik JF" "Jiao X" "Li A" "Sergeev YV" "Ding X" "Sharma AK" "Chan CC" "Medina I" "Edwards AO."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
