{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Coordinator of PRMT5 and differentiation stimulator (also known as COPRS or COPR5) is a histone-binding protein required for histone H4 methyltransferase activity of PRMT5, which targets nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. COPR5 is specifically required for histone H4 'Arg-3' methylation mediated by PRMT5, but not histone H3 'Arg-8' methylation, suggesting that it modulates the substrate specificity of nuclear PRMT5-containing complexes, at least towards histones. Recombinant COPR5 binds to the N-terminal of histone H4 and is required to recruit PRMT5 to reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro [[cite:PUB00069974]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36461" "COORDINATOR OF PRMT5 AND DIFFERENTIATION STIMULATOR"}, "pfam" {"PF15340" "Cooperator of PRMT5 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coordinator of PRMT5 and differentiation stimulator", "short" "COPR5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 305, "taxa" 1058, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 479, "sets" 0, "proteins" 477, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 347}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029289", :literature {"PUB00069974" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Lacroix M" "El Messaoudi S" "Rodier G" "Le Cam A" "Sardet C" "Fabbrizio E."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO Rep.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/embor.2008.45", "medline_journal" "EMBO Rep", "title" "The histone-binding protein COPR5 is required for nuclear functions of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "452-8", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18404153}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042393", "name" "histone binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029289", "name" "Coordinator of PRMT5 and differentiation stimulator", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 394}}}
