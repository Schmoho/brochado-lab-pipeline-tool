{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The spectrum of DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species includes a wide variety of modifications of purine and pyrimidine bases. Among these modified bases, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is an important mutagenic lesion. Base excision repair is a critical mechanism for preventing mutations by removing the oxidative lesion from the DNA. Escherichia coli Nth protein (endonuclease III) has an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity which removes 8-oxoG preferentially from 8-oxoG/G mispairs. Homo sapiens (Human) hNTH1 protein, a homologue of E. coli Nth protein, has similar DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity that removes 8-oxoG from 8-oxoG/G mispairs [[cite:PUB00007891]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2abk", "name" "REFINEMENT OF THE NATIVE STRUCTURE OF ENDONUCLEASE III TO A RESOLUTION OF 1.85 ANGSTROM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011257", "name" "DNA glycosylase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023170", "name" "Helix-hairpin-helix, base-excision DNA repair, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00942" "Endonuclease III [nth]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01083" "endonuclease III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endonuclease III", "short" "Nth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8776, "taxa" 34464, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39938, "sets" 0, "proteins" 39938, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30698}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
