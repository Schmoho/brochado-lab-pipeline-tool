{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase family (AHBA_syn) that are probably all pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferase enzymes with a variety of molecular functions. Members of the family have the same structural fold as members of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aspartate aminotransferase superfamily [[cite:PUB00023569]].</p>\n\n<p>The AHBA_syn family members are involved in various biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolites. The AHBA_synfamily includes StsA [swissprot:P72454], StsC [swissprot:P77952] and StsS [[cite:PUB00008019]]. The aminotransferase activity was demonstrated for purified StsC protein as the L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase [ec:2.6.1.50], which catalyses the first amino transfer in the biosynthesis of the streptidine subunit of streptomycin [[cite:PUB00008019]]. Some other well studied proteins in this family are AHBA_synthase, the protein product of the pleiotropic regulatory gene degT, Arnb aminotransferase and pilin glycosylation protein. The prototype of this family, the AHBA_synthase, is a dimeric PLP dependent enzyme.</p>\n\n<p>AHBA_syn is the terminal enzyme of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) formation which is involved in the biosynthesis of ansamycin antibiotics, including rifamycin B. Some members of this family are involved in 4-amino-6-deoxy-monosaccharide D-perosamine synthesis. Perosamine is an important element in the glycosylation of several cell products, such as antibiotics and lipopolysaccharides of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The pilin glycosylation protein encoded by gene pglA, is a galactosyltransferase involved in pilin glycosylation. Additionally, this family consists of ArnB (PmrH) aminotransferase, a 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose lipopolysaccharide-modifying enzyme. This family also includes several predicted pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes apparently involved in regulation of cell wall biogenesis. The catalytic lysine which is present in all characterized PLP dependent enzymes is replaced by histidine in some members of this family [[cite:PUB00028947], [cite:PUB00050697], [cite:PUB00039920], [cite:PUB00042185], [cite:PUB00008019], [cite:PUB00006322], [cite:PUB00016898], [cite:PUB00016775], [cite:PUB00006531], [cite:PUB00079514], [cite:PUB00035507], [cite:PUB00079515], [cite:PUB00070977]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3nu8", "name" "WbpE, an Aminotransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Involved in O-antigen Assembly in Complex with the Internal Aldimine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00616" "AHBA_syn"}, "panther" {"PTHR30244" "TRANSAMINASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01041" "DegT/DnrJ/EryC1/StrS aminotransferase family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000390" "Predicted pyridoxal dependent aminotransferase, DegT/DnrJ/EryC1/StrS types"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DegT/DnrJ/EryC1/StrS aminotransferase", "short" "DegT/StrS_aminotransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 84, "domain_architectures" 306, "proteomes" 8002, "taxa" 33931, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 111095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 110128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 84069}, "pathways" 68}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1534", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1534"} {"accession" "GenProp1468", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1468"} {"accession" "GenProp1403", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1403"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
