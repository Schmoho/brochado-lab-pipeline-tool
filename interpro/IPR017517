{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family pulls together several groups of proteins, each very different from the others. They share in common three conserved regions. The first is a region of about 38 amino acids, nearly always at the N terminus of a protein. This region has a bulky hydrophobic residue, usually Trp, at position 29, and a His residue at position 37 that is invariant, so far, in over 150 instances. The second conserved region has a motif [DE]xxxHxxD. The third conserved region contains a hydrophobic patch and a well-conserved Arg residue. Most examples are found in the Actinobacteria, including the genera Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, Streptomyces, Nocardia, Frankia, etc. The pattern of near-invariant residues against a backdrop of extreme sequence divergence suggests enzymatic activity and conservation of active site residues, and therefore, members of this entry have been described as maleylpyruvate isomerase, mycothiol-dependent enzymes [[cite:PUB00042028]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2nsf", "name" "Crystal structure of the mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR034660", "name" "DinB/YfiT-like putative metalloenzymes", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03083" "maleylpyruvate isomerase family mycothiol-dependent enzyme"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Maleylpyruvate isomerase, mycothiol-dependent enzyme", "short" "Maleyloyr_isom"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1846, "taxa" 5899, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38960, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38960, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29201}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017517", :literature {"PUB00042028" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Wang R" "Yin YJ" "Wang F" "Li M" "Feng J" "Zhang HM" "Zhang JP" "Liu SJ" "Chang WR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
