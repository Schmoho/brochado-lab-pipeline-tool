{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of proteins of approximately 200 residues that are conserved in fungi. Ilm1 is part of the peroxisome, a complex that is the sole site of beta-oxidation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) and known to be required for optimal growth in the presence of fatty acid. Ilm1 may participate in the control of the C16/C18 ratio since it interacts strongly with Mga2p, a transcription factor that controls expression of Ole1, the sole fatty acyl desaturase in S. cerevisiae responsible for conversion of the saturated fatty acids stearate (C18) and palmitate (C16) to oleate and palmitoleate, respectively [[cite:PUB00044317]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28029" "PROTEIN ILM1"}, "pfam" {"PF10311" "Increased loss of mitochondrial DNA protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Increased loss of mitochondrial DNA protein 1", "short" "Incr_loss_mito_DNA_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 752, "taxa" 1957, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1114, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1098, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 714}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018815", :literature {"PUB00044317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lockshon D" "Surface LE" "Kerr EO" "Kaeberlein M" "Kennedy BK."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.106.064428", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The sensitivity of yeast mutants to oleic acid implicates the peroxisome and other processes in membrane function.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "77-91", "volume" "175", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17151231}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018815", "name" "Increased loss of mitochondrial DNA protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 49, "alignment:full" 567}}}
