{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from fungi and prokaryotes, including Siroheme biosynthesis protein met8 from budding and fission yeast, Precorrin-2 dehydrogenase from the archaea Methanosarcina barkeri (Mba_PC2_DH) and Precorrin-2 dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (SirC).</p>\n\n<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Met8 is a bifunctional dehydrogenase ([ec:1.3.1.76]) and ferrochelatase ([ec:4.99.1.4]) [[cite:PUB00014459]]. It catalyses the final two steps in the biosynthesis of sirohaem, involving a NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenation of precorrin-2 to generate sirohydrochlorin followed by ferrochelation to yield sirohaem [[cite:PUB00014702]]. Siroheme is a heme-like prosthetic group used by sulfite and nitrite reductases [[cite:PUB00067604]]. The structure of Met8 has been resolved. A single active site, Asp141, has been shown to play an essential role in both dehydrogenase and chelatase processes [[cite:PUB00014459]].</p>\n\n<p>Mba_PC2_DH is involved in the archaeal biosynthesis of heme. It catalyses the oxidation of precorrin-2 into sirohydroclorin [[cite:PUB00153053]].</p>\n\n<p>SirC catalyses the dehydrogenation of precorrin-2 to form sirohydrochlorin which is used as a precursor in both siroheme biosynthesis and in the anaerobic branch of adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00014676]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042518", "name" "Precorrin-2 dehydrogenase, C-terminal helical domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35330" "SIROHEME BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN MET8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Siroheme biosynthesis protein Met8-like", "short" "Met8-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3934, "taxa" 15028, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14243, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14243, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10895}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
