{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents Subtelomeric hrmA-associated cluster protein AFUB_079030 from Aspergillus fumigatus and similar fungal proteins. AFUB_079030 is part of the subtelomeric hrmA-associated cluster (HAC) containing genes that alter the hyphal surface (such as reduced total chitin or increased beta-glucan exposure) and perturb inter-hyphal interactions within the developing biofilms, resulting in a loss of vertically aligned polarised growing filaments [[cite:PUB00153731]]. This group also includes yeast protein YDR124W. Null mutant showed severe fragmentation of mitochondria and its expression is strongly induced by alpha factor. Some members of this family may have role in maintenance of mitochondrial morphology [[cite:PUB00101836]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36102" "CHROMOSOME 10, WHOLE GENOME SHOTGUN SEQUENCE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Subtelomeric hrmA-associated cluster protein AFUB_079030/YDR124W-like", "short" "AFUB_079030/YDR124W-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 806, "taxa" 2121, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1845, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1845, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1182}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021264", :literature {"PUB00101836" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Garapati HS" "Male G" "Mishra K."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Predicting subcellular localization of proteins using protein-protein interaction data.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "2361-2368", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31945465}, "PUB00153731" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kowalski CH" "Kerkaert JD" "Liu KW" "Bond MC" "Hartmann R" "Nadell CD" "Stajich JE" "Cramer RA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0558-7", "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "Fungal biofilm morphology impacts hypoxia fitness and disease progression.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "2430-2441", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31548684}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021264", "name" "Subtelomeric hrmA-associated cluster protein AFUB_079030/YDR124W-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
