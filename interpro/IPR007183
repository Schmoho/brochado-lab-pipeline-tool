{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of bacterial and archaeal proteins. MA1715 from the archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans is required for optimal growth with sulfide as the sole sulfur source and has been shown to support both cysteine and homocysteine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00086973]]. The protein is thought to capture environmental sulfide, catalyse its oxidation to sulfane, and then deliver this sulfane sulfur to specific target proteins. Two key recipients of this sulfur transfer are SepCysS and MA1821, which use it for cysteine and homocysteine biosynthesis respectively [[cite:PUB00158993]]. The presence of persulfides on the active-site cysteine residues of these target proteins provides evidence for this sulfur transfer mechanism. A similar system is seen with MJ1681, another protein containing cysteine persulfides that is involved in the production of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid [[cite:PUB00158972]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2o34", "name" "Crystal structure of protein DVU1097 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, Pfam DUF375"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR003374", "name" "ApbE-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006421" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP006421 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0280", "short" "UPF0280"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 531, "taxa" 3000, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2973, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2969, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2352}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007183", :literature {"PUB00086973" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Rauch BJ" "Perona JJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
