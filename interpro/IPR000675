{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Plant pathogenic fungi produce extracellular degradative enzymes [[cite:PUB00003749]] that play an important role in pathogenesis. They include cutinase, which hydrolyses cutin, facilitating fungus penetration through the cuticle. Cutinase is a serine esterase containing the classical Ser, His, Asp triad of serine hydrolases. The protein belongs to the α-β class, with a central β-sheet of 5 parallel strands covered by 5 helices on either side of the sheet. The active site cleft is partly covered by 2 thin bridges formed by amino acid side chains, by contrast with the hydrophobic lid possessed by other lipases [[cite:PUB00004118]]. The protein also contains 2 disulphide bridges, which are essential for activity, their cleavage resulting in complete loss of enzymatic activity.</p>\n\n<p>In the actinobacteria Kineococcus radiotolerans, this enzyme shows a C-terminal extension that is similar to the substrate binding domain of poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerases [[cite:PUB00100718]].</p>\n\n<p>Acetylxylan esterase from fungi removes acetyl side groups from xylan. The catalytic core of the enzyme has an α/β/α-sandwich fold, similar to that of cutinase [[cite:PUB00030352]].</p>\n\n<p>This protein family also includes enzymes that do not show cutinase activity but exhibit esterase activity, such as phospholipases and carboxylesterases from Actinobacteria. Phospholipase Culp4 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis hydrolyses dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine [[cite:PUB00100719], [cite:PUB00100716]], while Carboxylesterase Culp1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis hydrolyses various p-nitrophenol-linked aliphatic esters and has weak lipase activity [[cite:PUB00100719], [cite:PUB00100716], [cite:PUB00100717]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1g66", "name" "ACETYLXYLAN ESTERASE AT 0.90 ANGSTROM RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01110" "Cutinase"}, "pfam" {"PF01083" "Cutinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cutinase/acetylxylan esterase", "short" "Cutinase/axe"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 71, "domain_architectures" 156, "proteomes" 1542, "taxa" 4946, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16791, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16773, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11505}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
