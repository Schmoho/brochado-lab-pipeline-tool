{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>All members of this protein are the phage shock protein PspC [[cite:PUB00034603]]. The phage shock regulon is restricted to the Proteobacteria and somewhat sparsely distributed there. It is expressed, under positive control of a sigma-54-dependent transcription factor; PspF, which binds and is modulated by PspA. Stresses that induce the psp regulon include phage secretin over expression, ethanol, heat shock and protein export defects.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02978" "envelope stress response membrane protein PspC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage shock protein, PspC", "short" "Phageshock_PspC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 684, "taxa" 3272, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3068, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3068, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2400}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0648", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0648"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014320", :literature {"PUB00034603" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Maxson ME" "Darwin AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
