{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the YbaN protein family, also called PdaB and SpoVIE, of Gram-positive bacteria. Although ybaN null mutants have only a mild sporulation defect, ybaN/ytrI double mutants show drastically reduced sporulation efficiencies. This synthetic defect suggests the role of this sigmaE-controlled gene in sporulation had been masked by functional redundancy [[cite:PUB00034547]]. Members of this family are homologous to a characterised polysaccharide deacetylase.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes BC_3618 from Bacillus cereus. It is a peptidoglycan-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase that catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in peptidoglycan. It acts on cell wall peptidoglycan from the Gram-positive bacteria B.cereus and B.subtilis and the Gram-negative bacterium H.pylori, but not on acetylated xylan [[cite:PUB00093393]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4m1b", "name" "Structural Determination of BA0150, a Polysaccharide Deacetylase from Bacillus anthracis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02764" "polysaccharide deacetylase family sporulation protein PdaB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation polysaccharide deacetylase PdaB-like", "short" "PdaB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 562, "taxa" 1665, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1719, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1719, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1255}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
