{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides). GldA is an ABC transporter ATP-binding protein ([interpro:IPR003439]) linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Knockouts of GldA abolish the gliding phenotype [[cite:PUB00045358]]. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species C. johnsonae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03522" "gliding motility-associated ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit GldA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility-associated ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit GldA", "short" "Motility-assoc_ABC_GldA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 570, "taxa" 1823, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1856, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1856, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1418}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019864", :literature {"PUB00045358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Agarwal S" "Hunnicutt DW" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
