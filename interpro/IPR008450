In Drosophila, the eggshell framework is laid down between the developing oocyte and the overlying follicle cells during late oogenesis.

Genes encoding chorion proteins are expressed from oocyte development stage 11 onwards. Chorion synthesis occurs during the last 5-6 hours of oogenesis and demands the production of large amounts of protein. Amplification of the two chorion gene clusters meets demand for large scale protein production and expression is precisely regulated through tight transcriptional control of the chorion genes.
