{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are predicted to be metal-dependent hydrolases based on sequence analysis. They are related to Mg-dependent DNases and contain a TadD DNase domain. However, the similarity is not strong enough to confidently predict that these proteins are necessarily DNases and not some other type of metal-dependent hydrolase. Another related group is the TatD deoxyribonuclease family.</p>\n\n<p>Members of this group may be distantly related to a large 3D fold-based domain superfamily of metalloenzymes [[cite:PUB00004994]]. The description of this fold superfamily was based on an analysis of conservation patterns in three dimensions, and the discovery that the same active-site architecture occurs in a large set of enzymes involved primarily in nucleotide metabolism. The group is thought to include urease, dihydroorotase, allantoinase, hydantoinase, AMP-, adenine- and cytosine- deaminases, imidazolonepropionase, aryldialkylphosphatase, chlorohydrolase, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, and other enzymes [[cite:PUB00004994]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005295" "Predicted metal-dependent hydrolase related to TatD DNase"}, "panther" {"PTHR42658" "HYDROLASE TATD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function UCP005295", "short" "UCP005295"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1110, "taxa" 4556, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4190, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4189, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3156}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012022", :literature {"PUB00004994" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Holm L" "Sander C."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199705)28:1<72::AID-PROT7>3.3.CO;2-T", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "An evolutionary treasure: unification of a broad set of amidohydrolases related to urease.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "72-82", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9144792}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001130", "name" "3'-5' ssDNA/RNA exonuclease TatD-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011589", "name" "Protein of unknown function UCP004961", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR012022", "name" "Protein of unknown function UCP005295", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR015991", "name" "Hydrolase TatD/YcfH-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR033665", "name" "D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase DTD3", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR024918", "name" "3'-5' ssDNA/RNA exonuclease TatD", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR049677", "name" "Qat anti-phage system nuclease QatD", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
