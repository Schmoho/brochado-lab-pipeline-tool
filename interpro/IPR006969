{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the Stig1 cysteine rich protein and related plant proteins. The tobacco stigma-specific gene, STIG1  is developmentally regulated and expressed specifically in the stigmatic secretory zone. Pistils of transgenic STIG1-barnase tobacco plants undergo normal development, but lack the stigmatic secretory zone and are female sterile. Pollen grains are unable to penetrate the surface of the ablated pistils. Application of stigmatic exudate from wild-type pistils to the ablated surface increases the efficiency of pollen tube germination and growth and restores the capacity of pollen tubes to penetrate the style [[cite:PUB00009706]]. The exact function of STIG1 is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The STIG1 family is involved in various plant-specific functions, including the regulation of cell death, promotion of pollen tube growth, and modification of the interface between embryo and endosperm during seed development. Members of the family are typically cysteine-rich proteins that may undergo processing to perform their roles. For instance, a processed peptide of GRI induces cell death dependent on superoxide and salicylic acid, while STIG1 promotes pollen tube growth and binds phosphoinositol lipids, triggering an intracellular reactive oxygen species elevation. The family is also essential for the formation of structures like the embryo sheath and for the normal separation of embryo and endosperm tissues. This region contains three cystein-rich subdomains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04885" "Stigma-specific STIG1-like protein family"}, "panther" {"PTHR33227" "STIGMA-SPECIFIC STIG1-LIKE PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stigma-specific protein Stig1-like", "short" "Stig-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 208, "proteomes" 411, "taxa" 1781, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5826, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4519, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2700}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006969", :literature {"PUB00009706" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Goldman MH" "Goldberg RB" "Mariani C."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=8039494&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Female sterile tobacco plants are produced by stigma-specific cell ablation.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "2976-84", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8039494}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006969", "name" "Stigma-specific protein Stig1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 2124}}}
