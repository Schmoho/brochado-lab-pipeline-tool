{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of metallopeptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family M15 (clan MD), subfamily M15D (vanX D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptidase).</p>\n\n<p>The D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase enzyme from Enterococcus faecalis is also known as the vancomycin resistance protein VanX, and hydrolyses D-ala-D-ala. It has a 250-fold differential in catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of D-ala-D-ala versus D-ala-D-lactate. The latter therefore remains intact for subsequent incorporation into peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in the dipeptide D-ala-D-lactate rather than the dipeptide D-ala-D-ala, thereby preventing vancomycin from binding. The enzyme requires a metal cofactor, and is induced by vancomycin through regulation by VanS and VanR.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009045", "name" "Hedgehog signalling/DD-peptidase zinc-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43126" "D-ALANYL-D-ALANINE DIPEPTIDASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF026671" "D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01924" "D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase [ddpX]"}, "pfam" {"PF01427" "D-ala-D-ala dipeptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptidase", "short" "A_A_dipeptidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 83, "proteomes" 2830, "taxa" 12674, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15423, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15418, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11938}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
