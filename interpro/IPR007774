{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains several uncharacterised bacterial proteins. These proteins are found in nitrogen fixation operons, so are likely to play some role in this process. They consist of two Î± helices which are joined by a four residue linker. The helices form an antiparallel bundle and cross towards their termini. They are likely to form a rod-like dimer [[cite:PUB00052824]]. They have structural similarity to the regulatory protein Rop ([pfam:PF01815]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3csx", "name" "Structural characterization of a protein in the DUF683 family- crystal structure of cce_0567 from the cyanobacterium Cyanothece 51142."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029012", "name" "Helix hairpin bin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05082" "Rop-like"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037676" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP037676 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative nitrogen fixation protein", "short" "Put_N_fixation"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 390, "taxa" 2109, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1507, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1507, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1212}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007774", :literature {"PUB00052824" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Buchko GW" "Robinson H" "Addlagatta A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
