{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of transcription elongation factors which includes those referred to as Bex (brain-expressed X-linked) proteins as well as those named TCEAL (transcription elongation factor A protein-like). Bex proteins are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are known to play a role in neuronal development. They seem to have have distinct roles in cancers [[cite:PUB00080723]]. Bex1 was shown to be a novel link between neurotrophin signalling, the cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation, suggesting it might function by coordinating internal cellular states with the ability of cells to respond to external signals [[cite:PUB00073473]]. TCEAL7 has been shown negatively to regulate the NF-kappaB pathway, hence being important in ovarian cancer as it one of the genes frequently downregulated in this cancer [[cite:PUB00080719], [cite:PUB00080724]]. Apart from TCEAL7, there are other five members of the TCEAL family, i.e. TCEAL1, TCEAL3, TCEAL4, TCEAL5 and TCEAL8. TCEAL1 was shown involved in the apoptosis of human cancer cells [[cite:PUB00076348]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04538" "Brain expressed X-linked like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription elongation factor A-like/Brain expressed X-linked", "short" "TF_A-like/BEX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 451, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2113, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1359}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021156", :literature {"PUB00073473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Vilar M" "Murillo-Carretero M" "Mira H" "Magnusson K" "Besset V" "Ibanez CF."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601017", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Bex1, a novel interactor of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, links neurotrophin signaling to the cell cycle.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1219-30", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16498402}, "PUB00080719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Rattan R" "Narita K" "Chien J" "Maguire JL" "Shridhar R" "Giri S" "Shridhar V."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2009.431", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "TCEAL7, a putative tumor suppressor gene, negatively regulates NF-kappaB pathway.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1362-73", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19966855}, "PUB00080723" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kazi JU" "Kabir NN" "Ronnstrand L."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
