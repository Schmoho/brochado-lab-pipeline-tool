{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family feature an N-terminal signal sequence, small size, and two invariant Cys residues, 10-20 residues apart. One member of this family, UrcA from the aerobic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, is expressed so highly in response to uranium, but not other heavy metals, that a genetically engineered strain expressing green fluorescent protein in place of UrcA serves as a biodetector for micromolar uranyl ion. Caulobacter crescentus tolerates high levels of UVI exposure by mineralising the uranium. UrcA and its homologues may participate in such a process [[cite:PUB00074333]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04433" "UrcA family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UrcA family protein", "short" "UrcA_uranyl"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 360, "taxa" 1140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2237, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2230, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1820}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030972", :literature {"PUB00074333" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Hillson NJ" "Hu P" "Andersen GL" "Shapiro L."], "ISO_journal" "Appl.
