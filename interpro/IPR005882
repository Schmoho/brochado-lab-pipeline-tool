{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N-Acetylglucosamine-1-PO(4) uridyltransferase (GlmU, [ec:2.7.7.23]) is a trimeric bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the last two sequential reactions in the de novo biosynthetic pathway for UDP-GlcNAc.</p>\n\n<p>The X-ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli GlmU in complex with UDP-GlcNAc and CoA has been determined to 2.1 A resolution and reveals a two-domain architecture that is responsible for these two reactions [[cite:PUB00007906]]. The C-terminal domain is responsible for the CoA-dependent acetylation of Glc-1-PO(4) to GlcNAc-1-PO(4) and displays the longest left-handed parallel β-helix (LbetaH or LbH) observed to date. The acetyltransferase active site defined by the binding site for CoA makes use of residues from all three subunits and is positioned beneath an open cavity large enough to accommodate the Glc-1-PO(4) acetyl acceptor. The N-terminal domain catalyzes uridyl transfer from UTP to GlcNAc-1-PO(4) to form the final products UDP-GlcNAc and pyrophosphate. This domain is composed of a central seven-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices in a Rossmann fold-like topology.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v0h", "name" "Characterization of Substrate Binding and Catalysis of the Potential Antibacterial Target N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate Uridyltransferase (GlmU)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01631" "Bifunctional protein GlmU [glmU]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01173" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase/glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional protein GlmU", "short" "Bifunctional_GlmU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7113, "taxa" 26758, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29166, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29166, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22417}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0750", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0750"} {"accession" "GenProp1623", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1623"} {"accession" "GenProp1443", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1443"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
