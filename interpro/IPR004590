It is able to promote the annealing of complementary single\r\nDNA strands and can catalyze the formation of joint molecules [[cite:PUB00007687]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00616" "recombinase, phage RecT family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA single-strand annealing protein RecT", "short" "ssDNA_annealing_RecT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 768, "taxa" 4657, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3810, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3786, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2315}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004590", :literature {"PUB00007687" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Shiraishi K" "Hanada K" "Iwakura Y" "Ikeda H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
