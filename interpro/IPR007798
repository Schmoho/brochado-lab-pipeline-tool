{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of mammalian Ameloblastin precursor (Amelin) proteins. Matrix proteins of tooth enamel consist mainly of amelogenin but also of non-amelogenin proteins, which, although their volumetric percentage is low, have an important role in enamel mineralization. One of the non-amelogenin proteins is ameloblastin, also known as amelin and sheathlin. Ameloblastin (AMBN) is one of the enamel sheath proteins which is thought to have a role in determining the prismatic structure of growing enamel crystals [[cite:PUB00010139]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00817" "Ameloblastin precursor (Amelin)"}, "pfam" {"PF05111" "Ameloblastin precursor (Amelin)"}, "panther" {"PTHR14115" "AMELOBLASTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ameloblastin precursor", "short" "Amelin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 154, "taxa" 674, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 322, "sets" 0, "proteins" 322, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 226}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007798", :literature {"PUB00010139" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Shintani S" "Kobata M" "Toyosawa S" "Fujiwara T" "Sato A" "Ooshima T."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Identification and characterization of ameloblastin gene in a reptile.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "245-54", "volume" "283", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11867231}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030345", "name" "structural constituent of tooth enamel", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0042475", "name" "odontogenesis of dentin-containing tooth", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007798", "name" "Ameloblastin precursor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 229}}}
