{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents one small subunit, C1a-32, of the C1a projection (the seventh projection of the flagellum in Chlamydomonas) [[cite:PUB00076773]]. Numerous studies have indicated that each of the seven projections associated with the central pair of microtubules in the flagellum plays a distinct role in regulating eukaryotic ciliary/flagellar motility. The C1a projection is a complex of proteins including PF6, C1a-86, C1a-34, C1a-32, C1a-18, and calmodulin. C1a projection is involved in modulating flagella beat frequency and this is mediated via the C1a-34, C1a-32, and C1a-18 sub-complex by modulating the activity of both the inner and outer dynein arms [[cite:PUB00076774]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 119, whose function is unknown and ciliary-associated calcium-binding coiled-coil protein 1 (Cabcoco1) from vertebrates, a calcium-binding protein which may have a role in control of sperm flagellar movement [[cite:PUB00088320]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28457" "COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 189"}, "pfam" {"PF14769" "Flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32", "short" "CLAMP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 29, "proteomes" 936, "taxa" 3621, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2965, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2885, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1921}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032727", :literature {"PUB00076773" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 20", "authors" ["Wargo MJ" "Dymek EE" "Smith EF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
