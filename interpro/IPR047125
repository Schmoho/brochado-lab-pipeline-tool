{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes dynactin 5 (DCTN5, also known as subunit p25). Dynactin is a major component of the activator complex that stimulates dynein-mediated vesicle transport [[cite:PUB00101988], [cite:PUB00101989]]. Dynactin is a heterocomplex of at least eight subunits, including a 150,000-MW protein called Glued, the actin-capping protein Arp1, and dynamatin [[cite:PUB00101986]]. In vitro binding experiments show that dynactin enhances dynein-dependent motility, possibly through interaction with microtubules and vesicles. DCTN5 is part of the pointed-end subcomplex in dynactin that also includes p26, p27 (also known as dynactin 6), and Arp11. This subcomplex interacts with membranous cargoes. DCTN5 plays a dual role in cargo binding and dynactin regulation, being critical for this process [[cite:PUB00101989]]. DCTN5 contains imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X), indicating a left-handed parallel Î²-helix (LbH) structural domain [[cite:PUB00101987]]. Proteins containing hexapeptide repeats are often enzymes showing acyltransferase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011004", "name" "Trimeric LpxA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03359" "LbH_Dynactin_5"}, "panther" {"PTHR46126" "DYNACTIN SUBUNIT 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dynactin subunit 5", "short" "DCTN5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2198, "taxa" 7376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3387, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3387, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2289}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047125", :literature {"PUB00101988" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Zhang K" "Foster HE" "Rondelet A" "Lacey SE" "Bahi-Buisson N" "Bird AW" "Carter AP."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Cryo-EM Reveals How Human Cytoplasmic Dynein Is Auto-inhibited and Activated.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1303-1314.e18", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28602352}, "PUB00101989" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Qiu R" "Zhang J" "Xiang X."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "p25 of the dynactin complex plays a dual role in cargo binding and dynactin regulation.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "15606-15619", "volume" "293", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30143531}, "PUB00101986" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Burakov AV" "Nadezhdina ES."], "ISO_journal" "Ontogenez", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Ontogenez", "title" "[Dynein and dynactin as organizers of the system of cell microtubules].", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "323-39", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17066975}, "PUB00101987" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Parisi G" "Fornasari MS" "Echave J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Dynactins p25 and p27 are predicted to adopt the LbetaH fold.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1-4", "volume" "562", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15043994}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047125", "name" "Dynactin subunit 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
