{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins specific to actinomycetes that are related to the small protein DLW-39. These proteins contain a highly hydrophobic stretch of about 15 amino acids, flanked by pairs of basic residues, and a C-terminal region, in which most members of the family share the motif (DLW). Members of this family are typically about 39 amino acids in length. This family is uncharacterised.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038356" "DLW-39 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DLW-39-like", "short" "DLW39-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 721, "taxa" 2179, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1733, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1733, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1188}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047990", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047990", "name" "DLW-39-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
