{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of uncharacterised proteins is found in bacteria (Bacteroidota and Chloroflexi). Proteins in this family are approximately 80 amino acids in length. The proteins are likely to be integral membrane proteins with two transmembrane alpha helices.  Structural modelling suggests that these proteins form a dimeric arrangement with the pairs of alpha helices tilted at close to 45 degrees angle compared to the lipid membrane. Based on the positive inside rule it is likely that the N and C-terminii of the proteins have a cytoplasmic location. Given the geometry of the protein complex it may not span the entire membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24717" "Family of unknown function (DUF7672)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7672", "short" "DUF7672"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 129, "sets" 0, "proteins" 129, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056089", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056089", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7672", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 12, "alignment:full" 12}}}
