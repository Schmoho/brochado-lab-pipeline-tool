{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs), also known as chitinase-like proteins, are soluble factors involved in the regulation of proliferation in imaginal discs [[cite:PUB00034892]]. They are a family of growth factors identified in insects that include at least five members, some of which are encoded by genes in a tight cluster [[cite:PUB00085932]]. The IDGFs have an eight-stranded α/β barrel fold and are related to the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (GH18) chitinases, but they have an amino acid substitution known to abolish chitinase catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00085931]]. IDGFs may have evolved from chitinases to gain new functions as growth factors, interacting with cell surface glycoproteins involved in growth-promoting processes [[cite:PUB00026449]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jnd", "name" "Crystal structure of imaginal disc growth factor-2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02873" "GH18_IDGF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Imaginal disc growth factor", "short" "IDGF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 571, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 466, "sets" 0, "proteins" 455, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 362}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015520", :literature {"PUB00034892" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Bryant PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Novartis Found.
