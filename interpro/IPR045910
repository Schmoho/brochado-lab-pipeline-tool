{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the long-chain primary alcohol dehydrogenase AdhA (ADHA) from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus (formerly known as Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum). This enzyme is an alcohol dehydrogenase active against primary long-chain alcohols that catalyzes the reduction of acetaldehyde to alcohol with NADP as cofactor [[cite:PUB00099304]]. The ADH of hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus hydrothermalis oxidizes a series of primary aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, preferentially from C2 to C8, but is also active towards methanol and glycerol, and is stereospecific for monoterpenes. [[cite:PUB00099303], [cite:PUB00099301], [cite:PUB00099305]]. Members of this protein family are mainly found in bacteria and archaea.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08186" "Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Long-chain primary alcohol dehydrogenase AdhA-like", "short" "AdhA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 69, "taxa" 603, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 315, "sets" 0, "proteins" 315, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 263}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
