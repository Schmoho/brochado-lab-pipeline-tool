{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthetase (IGPS) is a key metabolic enzyme, which links amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis: it catalyses the closure of the imidazole ring within histidine biosynthesis (fifth step), and provides the substrate for de novo purine biosynthesis. IGPS consists of two different subunits: HisH, a glutamine amidotransferase (glutaminase), and HisF, a synthase (cyclase). HisH functions to provide a source of nitrogen, which is required for the synthesis of histidine and purines. In the HisH glutaminase reaction, the hydrolysis of glutamine yields ammonia, which is then used by HisF in the subsequent synthase reaction. The X-ray structure of the HisH/HisF heterodimer of IGPS reveals a putative tunnel for the transfer of ammonia from HisH to HisF via a (β-α)8 barrel fold within HisF that abuts HisH [[cite:PUB00014925]]. Ammonia tunnels connect the glutaminase and synthase active sites.</p>\r\n<p>HisH belongs to a large group of enzymes found in diverse and fundamental anabolic pathways. These enzymes share a common domain, referred to as the type-I glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) domain, which can occur either as single polypeptides (as with HisH) or as domains of large multifunctional proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gud", "name" "Crystal Structure of Amidotransferase HisH from Vibrio cholerae"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01748" "Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain found in imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS)"}, "panther" {"PTHR42701" "IMIDAZOLE GLYCEROL PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE SUBUNIT HISH"}, "hamap" {"MF_00278" "Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisH [hisH]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000495" "Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, glutamine amidotransferase HisH subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01855" "imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, subunit H", "short" "Imidazole-glycPsynth_HisH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9955, "taxa" 37042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41387, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41379, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31581}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0794", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0794"} {"accession" "GenProp0109", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0109"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
