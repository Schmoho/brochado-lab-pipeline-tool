{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family is found in ORF158L from Singapore grouper iridovirus ([swissprot:Q5YFA7]) and similar viral proteins. ORF158L interacts with the histone H3/H4 complex and H3. It may play a key role in histone H3 modulation and function as a histone H3 chaperon. It folds into two β-sheets that form an elongated β-sandwich domain, and two short α-helices on one surface of the molecule with several loops between the secondary structures. The β-sheets consist of four antiparallel β-strands and five antiparallel β-strands, respectively [[cite:PUB00058961]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21644" "Histone H3 binding protein ORF158L-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone H3 binding protein ORF158L-like", "short" "ORF158L-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 27, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048864", :literature {"PUB00058961" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Tran BN" "Chen L" "Liu Y" "Wu J" "Velazquez-Campoy A" "Sivaraman J" "Hew CL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
