{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The members of this family are sequences that are similar to TraC ([swissprot:Q84HT8]) from Rhizobium etli. The gene encoding this protein is one of a group of genes found on plasmid p42a of Rhizobium etli (strain CFN 42/ATCC 51251) that are thought to be involved in the process of plasmid self-transmission. Mobilisation of plasmid p42a is of importance as it is required for transfer of plasmid p42d, the symbiotic plasmid which carries most of the genes required for nodulation and nitrogen fixation by this symbiotic bacterium. The predicted protein products of p42a are similar to known transfer proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid pTiC58 [[cite:PUB00016590]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07820" "TraC-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TraC-like", "short" "TraC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 91, "taxa" 713, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 867, "sets" 0, "proteins" 867, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 701}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0490", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0490"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012930", :literature {"PUB00016590" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Tun-Garrido C" "Bustos P" "Gonzalez V" "Brom S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
