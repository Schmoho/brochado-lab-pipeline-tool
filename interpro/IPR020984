{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Speedy (Spy1, also known as RINGO A) is a cell cycle regulatory protein which binds and activates CDK1 and CDK2 [[cite:PUB00099649]], protein kinases that allows progression through G1/S phase and further replication events. Spy1 activates CDK2 inducing a conformational change of the CDK2 T-loop that avoids its phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00099648]]. Spy1 expression overcomes a p27-induced cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA synthesis, so cell cycle progression occurs due to an interaction between Spy1 and p27 [[cite:PUB00054157]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31156" "WBSCR19-LIKE PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF11357" "Cell cycle regulatory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell cycle regulatory protein Speedy", "short" "Speedy"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 742, "taxa" 2771, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2076, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1966, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1266}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020984", :literature {"PUB00054157" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["McAndrew CW" "Gastwirt RF" "Meyer AN" "Porter LA" "Donoghue DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Cycle", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Cycle", "title" "Spy1 enhances phosphorylation and degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1937-45", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17671428}, "PUB00099648" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["McGrath DA" "Fifield BA" "Marceau AH" "Tripathi S" "Porter LA" "Rubin SM."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Structural basis of divergent cyclin-dependent kinase activation by Spy1/RINGO proteins.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "2251-2262", "volume" "36", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28666995}, "PUB00099649" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Porter LA" "Kong-Beltran M" "Donoghue DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "Spy1 interacts with p27Kip1 to allow G1/S progression.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "3664-74", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12972555}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019901", "name" "protein kinase binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045737", "name" "positive regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020984", "name" "Cell cycle regulatory protein Speedy", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 1508}}}
