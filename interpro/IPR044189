{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Exportins bind cargo molecules in the nuclei and transport them through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, a process that requires RanGTP. This entry includes Exportin 4 and 7 (also known as RanBP16), proteins that mediate the nuclear export of proteins with broad substrate specificity. They bind cooperatively to its cargo and to the GTPase Ran in its active GTP-bound form. Exportin 4 transports the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) and Smad3, controlling protein synthesis and Smad signalling [[cite:PUB00095478], [cite:PUB00090434]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Ran-binding protein 17 from humans.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12596" "EXPORTIN 4,7-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exportin 4/7-like", "short" "XPO4/7-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1641, "taxa" 6380, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8905, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8905, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5538}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044189", :literature {"PUB00090434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Aksu M" "Pleiner T" "Karaca S" "Kappert C" "Dehne HJ" "Seibel K" "Urlaub H" "Bohnsack MT" "Gorlich D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
