{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Casparian strip membrane proteins (CASPs) are four-membrane-span proteins that mediate the deposition of Casparian strips in the endodermis by recruiting the lignin polymerization machinery. CASP-like proteins (CASPLs) contain a CASP domain and are also able to form transmembrane scaffolds. The transmembrane domains, particularly the first (TM1) and the third (TM3) are highly conserved among these proteins. CASPLs can be classified in five groups (1-5); this family represents group 5 (CASPL5). In Arabidopsis, CASPLs showed specific expression in a variety of cell types, such as trichomes, abscission zone cells, peripheral root cap cells, and xylem pole pericycle cells [[cite:PUB00072979]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32021" "CASP-LIKE PROTEIN 5B3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CASP-like protein 5", "short" "CASPL-5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 967, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3488, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3488, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2072}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045009", :literature {"PUB00072979" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Roppolo D" "Boeckmann B" "Pfister A" "Boutet E" "Rubio MC" "Denervaud-Tendon V" "Vermeer JE" "Gheyselinck J" "Xenarios I" "Geldner N."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.239137", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Functional and evolutionary analysis of the CASPARIAN STRIP MEMBRANE DOMAIN PROTEIN family.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24920445}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045009", "name" "CASP-like protein 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
