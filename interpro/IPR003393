{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ammonia monooxygenase and the particulate methane monooxygenase are both integral membrane proteins, occurring in ammonia oxidisers and methanotrophs respectively, which are thought to be evolutionarily related [[cite:PUB00016963]]. These enzymes have a relatively wide substrate specificity and can catalyse the oxidation of a range of substrates including ammonia, methane, halogenated hydrocarbons and aromatic molecules [[cite:PUB00016964]]. These enzymes are composed of 3 subunits -A ([interpro:IPR003393]), B ([interpro:IPR006833]) and C ([interpro:IPR006980]) -and contain various metal centres, including copper. Particulate methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus str.
