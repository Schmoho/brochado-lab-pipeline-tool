{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of distantly related to MazG-type NTP pyrophosphohydrolase (NTP-PPase) which contain the conserved residues of the MazG domain (at least three of the Glu residues, Asp, Lys and Arg), including those shown to be functionally important [[cite:PUB00013554]]. This entry includes the putative pyrophosphatases YpjD and YvdC from Bacillus subtilis. Although its biological role has not been described in detail, YpjD shows significant sequence similarity to the dimeric 2-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTP pyrophosphatase or dUTPase) and NTP-PPase MazG proteins. However, unlike typical tandem-domain MazG proteins, BsYpjD contains a single MazG-like domain [[cite:PUB00079704]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42692" "NUCLEOTIDE PYROPHOSPHOHYDROLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NTP pyrophosphohydrolase MazG-related, YpjD/YvdC", "short" "YpjD/YvdC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1850, "taxa" 6943, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7747, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7747, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5937}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047046", :literature {"PUB00013554" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Zhang J" "Zhang Y" "Inouye M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
