In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>On the basis of sequence similarities, the vast majority of these solute-binding proteins can be grouped into eight families of clusters, which generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound.
