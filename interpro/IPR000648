{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of eukaryotic proteins that seem to be involved with sterol synthesis and/or its regulation have been found [[cite:PUB00005653]] to be evolutionary related. These include mammalian oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a protein of about 800 amino-acid residues that binds a variety of oxysterols (oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol) [[cite:PUB00100203], [cite:PUB00100201]]; yeast Osh1, a protein of 859 residues that also plays a role in ergosterol synthesis [[cite:PUB00100205]]; yeast proteins Hes1 and Kes1, highly related proteins of 434 residues that seem to play a role in ergosterol synthesis [[cite:PUB00100206], [cite:PUB00100204]]; Probable transporter efuK from the fungi Hormonema carpetanum, which is involved in the biosynthesis of enfumafungin [[cite:PUB00100237]]; and OSBP-related proteins (ORP) from plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00100202]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ic4", "name" "Crystal structure of Osh3 ORD from Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037239", "name" "Oxysterol-binding protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10972" "OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF01237" "Oxysterol-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oxysterol-binding protein", "short" "Oxysterol-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 538, "proteomes" 2669, "taxa" 9068, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43677, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42482, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25820}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00774", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00774"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000648", :literature {"PUB00005653" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Jiang B" "Brown JL" "Sheraton J" "Fortin N" "Bussey H."], "ISO_journal" "Yeast", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.320100307", "medline_journal" "Yeast", "title" "A new family of yeast genes implicated in ergosterol synthesis is related to the human oxysterol binding protein.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "341-53", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8017104}, "PUB00100237" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Kuhnert E" "Li Y" "Lan N" "Yue Q" "Chen L" "Cox RJ" "An Z" "Yokoyama K" "Bills GF."], "ISO_journal" "Environ Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Environ Microbiol", "title" "Enfumafungin synthase represents a novel lineage of fungal triterpene cyclases.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "3325-3342", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30051576}, "PUB00100205" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Beh CT" "Cool L" "Phillips J" "Rine J."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Overlapping functions of the yeast oxysterol-binding protein homologues.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1117-40", "volume" "157", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11238399}, "PUB00100202" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4-5", "authors" ["Skirpan AL" "Dowd PE" "Sijacic P" "Jaworski CJ" "Gilroy S" "Kao TH."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "Identification and characterization of PiORP1, a Petunia oxysterol-binding-protein related protein involved in receptor-kinase mediated signaling in pollen, and analysis of the ORP gene family in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "553-65", "volume" "61", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16897474}, "PUB00100203" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5714", "authors" ["Wang PY" "Weng J" "Anderson RG."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "OSBP is a cholesterol-regulated scaffolding protein in control of ERK 1/2 activation.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1472-6", "volume" "307", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15746430}, "PUB00100201" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Suchanek M" "Hynynen R" "Wohlfahrt G" "Lehto M" "Johansson M" "Saarinen H" "Radzikowska A" "Thiele C" "Olkkonen VM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "The mammalian oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORPs) bind 25-hydroxycholesterol in an evolutionarily conserved pocket.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "473-80", "volume" "405", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17428193}, "PUB00100204" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Encinar Del Dedo J" "Fernandez-Golbano IM" "Pastor L" "Meler P" "Ferrer-Orta C" "Rebollo E" "Geli MI."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "Coupled sterol synthesis and transport machineries at ER-endocytic contact sites.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "220", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34283201}, "PUB00100206" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Tian S" "Ohta A" "Horiuchi H" "Fukuda R."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Oxysterol-binding protein homologs mediate sterol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria in yeast.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "5636-5648", "volume" "293", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29487131}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008289", "name" "lipid binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000648", "name" "Oxysterol-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 301, "alignment:full" 29975}}}
