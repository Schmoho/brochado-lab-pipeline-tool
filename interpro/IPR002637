{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains a group of purine NTP pyrophosphatases, including dITP/XTP pyrophosphatase RdgB from E.coli and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA, also known as HAM1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) ([swissprot:P47119]), as well as archaeal and Caenorhabditis elegans homologues. S. cerevisiae HAM1 was originally identified as a gene that protects against the mutagenic effects of the base analogue 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) which can be a natural product of monooxygenase activity on adenine [[cite:PUB00005658], [cite:PUB00064772]]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HAM1 detoxifies abnormal pyrimidine as well as purine nucleotides [[cite:PUB00064770]]. RdgB appears to act by intercepting non-canonical deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates from replication precursor pools [[cite:PUB00106860], [cite:PUB00046222], [cite:PUB00053239]].</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a Ham1-related protein from Methanococcus jannaschii is a novel NTPase that has been shown to hydrolyze nonstandard nucleotides such as XTP to XMP and ITP to IMP, but not the standard nucleotides, in the presence of Mg or Mn ions. The enzyme exists as a homodimer [[cite:PUB00023533]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Dihydroneopterin triphosphate diphosphatase which is involved in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate and catalyses the hydrolysis of dihydroneopterin triphosphate to dihydroneopterin monophosphate and pyrophosphate [[cite:PUB00155441]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1v7r", "name" "Structure of nucleotide triphosphate pyrophosphatase from pyrococcus horikoshii OT3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029001", "name" "Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00515" "HAM1"}, "pfam" {"PF01725" "Ham1 family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00042" "RdgB/HAM1 family non-canonical purine NTP pyrophosphatase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11067" "INOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE PYROPHOSPHATASE/HAM1 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RdgB/HAM1", "short" "RdgB/HAM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 230, "proteomes" 11863, "taxa" 47020, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 52128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38688}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
