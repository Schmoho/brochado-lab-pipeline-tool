{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA helicase NPH-II or I8 is found in Poxviridae. It is essential for viral replication. Plays an important role during transcription of early mRNAs, presumably by preventing R-loop formation behind the elongating RNA polymerase. Acts as NTP-dependent helicase that catalyzes unidirectional unwinding of 3'tailed duplex RNAs. It might also play a role in the export of newly synthesized mRNA chains out of the core into the cytoplasm and is required for propagation of viral particles[[cite:PUB00053892]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12011" "RNA helicase NPH-II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA helicase NPH-II", "short" "NPH-II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 40, "taxa" 166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
