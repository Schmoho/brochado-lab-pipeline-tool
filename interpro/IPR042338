Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (also known as TNF-alpha or cachectin) is a monocyte-derived cytotoxin that has been implicated in tumour regression, septic shock and cachexia [[cite:PUB00006091], [cite:PUB00006095]]. The protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine [[cite:PUB00006101]]. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00006098]]. Both the mature protein and a partially-processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide [[cite:PUB00006098]].</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of different families of TNF, but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that are recognised by their specific receptors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hew", "name" "The X-ray crystal structure of murine OX40L"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008983", "name" "Tumour necrosis factor-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17534" "OX40 LIGAND"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4", "short" "TNFSF4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 213, "taxa" 773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 330, "sets" 0, "proteins" 330, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 236}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042338", :literature {"PUB00006101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sherry B" "Jue DM" "Zentella A" "Cerami A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
