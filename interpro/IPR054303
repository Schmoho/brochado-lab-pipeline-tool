{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HopBA1 is a type III effector protein that triggers an RBA1-dependent cell-death response. It folds into an α/β structure that consists of a central mixed β-sheet packed on both sides with α-helices [[cite:PUB00154010]]. HopBA1 is structurally similar to proteins members of EreA/ChaN-like superfamily. It contains a ψ-loop between strands 5 and 6.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22079" "Type III effector protein HopBA1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III effector protein HopBA1", "short" "HopBA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 54, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054303", :literature {"PUB00154010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Nishimura MT" "Anderson RG" "Cherkis KA" "Law TF" "Liu QL" "Machius M" "Nimchuk ZL" "Yang L" "Chung EH" "El Kasmi F" "Hyunh M" "Osborne Nishimura E" "Sondek JE" "Dangl JL."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1620973114", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "TIR-only protein RBA1 recognizes a pathogen effector to regulate cell death in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "E2053-E2062", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28137883}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054303", "name" "Type III effector protein HopBA1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 3}}}
