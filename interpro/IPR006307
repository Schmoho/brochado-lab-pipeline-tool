{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins related to bacterial flagellar biosynthesis proteins and involved in bacterial type III protein secretion systems, including Secretion apparatus protein BsaZ from Burkholderia pseudomallei. BsaZ is involved in the intracellular replication of invading bacteria inside the host cell. It is likely to be necessary for the lysis of the vacuole membrane and escape into the host cell cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00150963]]. Surface presentation of antigens protein SpaS from Salmonella typhimurium, involved in a secretory pathway responsible for the surface presentation of determinants needed for the entry of Salmonella species into mammalian cells, also belongs to this group. This family is homologous to, but distinguished from, flagellar biosynthetic protein FlhB ([interpro:IPR006136]) [[cite:PUB00104257]]. Members of this group are mostly found in proteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01404" "type III secretion system export apparatus subunit SctU"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III exporter system, secretion apparatus protein BsaZ-like", "short" "BsaZ-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 276, "taxa" 2290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2262}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006307", :literature {"PUB00104257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Portaliou AG" "Tsolis KC" "Loos MS" "Zorzini V" "Economou A."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Trends Biochem Sci", "title" "Type III Secretion: Building and Operating a Remarkable Nanomachine.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "175-189", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26520801}, "PUB00150963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Burtnick MN" "Brett PJ" "Nair V" "Warawa JM" "Woods DE" "Gherardini FC."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "Burkholderia pseudomallei type III secretion system mutants exhibit delayed vacuolar escape phenotypes in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "2991-3000", "volume" "76", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18443088}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009306", "name" "protein secretion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006135", "name" "Type III secretion system substrate exporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004683", "name" "Type III secretion system substrate exporter FlhB-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006136", "name" "Flagellar biosynthetic protein FlhB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006307", "name" "Type III exporter system, secretion apparatus protein BsaZ-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
