{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes LppA, which is a lipoprotein found in pathogenic mycobacteria. These pathogenic lipoproteins may play a role in host-pathogen interactions. Lipoproteins localised to the cell-envelope of pathogenic bacteria are major determinants of virulence. The proteins are localised to the cell-surface via an N-terminal lipidation carried out by a transferase - pro-lipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase Lgt - which attaches a diacylglyceride molecule to a sulfur atom from a crucial cysteine, and a consecutively acting lipoprotein signal peptidase LspA that cleaves the signal peptide just before the modified cysteine. When the peptidase is inactivated the pathogen has difficulty in replicating inside macrophages [[cite:PUB00059717]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v7s", "name" "Crystal structure of the putative lipoprotein LppA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16708" "Lipoprotein confined to pathogenic Mycobacterium"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative lipoprotein, pathogenic bacteria", "short" "LppA/LppB/LprP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 143, "taxa" 537, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 722, "sets" 0, "proteins" 720, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 593}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032018", :literature {"PUB00059717" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Grana M" "Bellinzoni M" "Bellalou J" "Haouz A" "Miras I" "Buschiazzo A" "Winter N" "Alzari PM."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis LppA, a lipoprotein confined to pathogenic mycobacteria.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "769-72", "volume" "78", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19899167}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR032018", "name" "Putative lipoprotein, pathogenic bacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 14, "alignment:full" 254}}}
