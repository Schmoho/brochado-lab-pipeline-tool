{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CDI toxins are expressed by Gram-negative bacteria as part of a mechanism to inhibit the growth of neighboring cells. This entry represents the inhibitor (CdiI, also called CdiI immunity protein) of the CdiA effector protein from Escherichia coli A0 34/86, and similar proteins.</p>\n\n<p>CdiA secretion is dependent on the outer membrane protein CdiB. Upon binding to a receptor on the surface of target bacteria, the CDI toxin is delivered via its C-terminal domain (CdiA-CT). The CdiI immunity proteins are intracellular proteins that inactivate the toxin/effector protein to prevent auto-inhibition. They are specific for their cognate CdiA-CT and do not protect cells from the toxins of other CDI bacteria. Thus, CDI systems encode a complex network of toxin-immunity protein pairs that are deployed for intercellular competition. This E. coli CdiI binds its cognate toxin CdiA-CT domain with high affinity [[cite:PUB00111477], [cite:PUB00111476]]. E.coli A0 CdiI adopts an α/β structure consisting of a central antiparallel β-sheet and helices packed on it ([pdbe:5T86]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5t86", "name" "Crystal structure of CDI complex from E. coli A0 34/86"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24172" "CdiI immunity protein EcoliA0-like"}, "cdd" {"cd20693" "inhibitor (or immunity protein) of the contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system of Escherichia coli A0 34/86, and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CdiI immunity protein EcoliA0-like", "short" "CdiI_EcoliA0-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 86, "taxa" 570, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 444, "sets" 0, "proteins" 444, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 291}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049585", :literature {"PUB00111476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hayes CS" "Koskiniemi S" "Ruhe ZC" "Poole SJ" "Low DA."], "ISO_journal" "Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med", "title" "Mechanisms and biological roles of contact-dependent growth inhibition systems.
