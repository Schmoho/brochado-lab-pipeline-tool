{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents PatD and its homologues, a protein identified in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, that regulates heterocyst frequency in this organism, ensuring its optimal filament growth. The NtcA-regulated gene patD controls the ratio of heterocysts relative to vegetative cells on filaments. Such a regulation provides a mechanism through which carbon fixation by vegetative cells and nitrogen fixation by heterocysts are properly balanced to ensure optimal growth and keep a competitive edge for long-term survival [[cite:PUB00105480]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF037954" "heterocyst frequency control protein PatD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heterocyst frequency control protein PatD-like", "short" "PatD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 168, "taxa" 1002, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 560, "sets" 0, "proteins" 560, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 379}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047810", :literature {"PUB00105480" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Wang L" "Lin GM" "Niu TC" "Zhang SR" "Zhang JY" "Tang GF" "Chen W" "Zhang CC."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "patD, a Gene Regulated by NtcA, Is Involved in the Optimization of Heterocyst Frequency in the Cyanobacterium Anabaena sp.
