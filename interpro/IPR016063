{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of uncharacterised proteins. Family members were initially considered to be putative cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases, [[cite:PUB00017670]], but this is no longer thought to be the case. The sequences have a signal peptide. Members of this family occur in Deinococcus radiodurans (bacterial) and Methanococcus jannaschii (archaeal).
