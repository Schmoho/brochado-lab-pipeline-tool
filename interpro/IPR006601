{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of a group of Drosophila melanogaster proteins of unknown function. A number of these proteins are expressed in nonneuronal auxiliary cells within two nested subsets of chemosensory sensilla on the front legs of male D. melanogaster, suggesting they may be involved in pheromone response [[cite:PUB00009688]]. These proteins are predicted to have a single transmembrane domain at their amino terminus, probably to serve as a signal peptide, suggesting that they are soluble and secreted.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00675" "Domains in hypothetical proteins in Drosophila including 2 in CG15241 and CG9329."}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family DM11, Drosophila melanogaster", "short" "Uncharacterised_DM11_DROME"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 374, "sets" 0, "proteins" 367, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 294}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006601", :literature {"PUB00009688" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Xu A" "Park SK" "D'Mello S" "Kim E" "Wang Q" "Pikielny CW."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Tissue Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-002-0524-0", "medline_journal" "Cell Tissue Res", "title" "Novel genes expressed in subsets of chemosensory sensilla on the front legs of male Drosophila melanogaster.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "381-92", "volume" "307", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11904775}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006601", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family DM11, Drosophila melanogaster", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
