{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group catalyse a step in tyrosine biosynthesis in the shikimate pathway, which is present only in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants [[cite:PUB00015637]]. They belong to the prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH) domain superfamily [interpro:IPR003099].</p>\n\n<p>Many of the PDH enzymes are able to use the alternative intermediates of tyrosine biosynthesis, prephenate or L-arogenate, as substrates, having both prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase activities, and are sometimes collectively called cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenases [[cite:PUB00011046], [cite:PUB00016002]]. Prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH) ([ec:1.3.1.12], [ec:1.3.1.13]) catalyses oxidative decarboxylation of prephenate to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Arogenate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.3.1.43]) catalyses oxidative decarboxylation of arogenate into tyrosine. The existence of different combinations for routing prephenate to phenylalanine or tyrosine means that the substrate specificity of a particular enzyme (arogenate or prephenate), as well as its susceptibility to feedback regulation by different metabolites is not easily predictable, and must be experimentally studied in detail [[cite:PUB00011044]].</p>\n\n<p>This group represents fungal PDH enzymes. It is closely related to the plant group ([interpro:IPR012070]), but is characterised by the unique C-terminal domain found only in the fungal enzymes. The experimentally characterised yeast enzyme is a NAD-dependent prephenate dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00016053], [cite:PUB00015943]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036510" "Prephenate dehydrogenase, fungal type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prephenate dehydrogenase, fungal", "short" "Prephenate_DH_fun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 899, "taxa" 2481, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1353, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1294, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 810}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
