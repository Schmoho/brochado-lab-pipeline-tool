{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>4,5-DOPA dioxygenase catalyses the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into 4,5-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (4,5-DOPA). The reaction results in the opening of the cyclic ring between carbons 4 and 5 and producing an unstable seco-DOPA that rearranges to betalamic acid. 4,5-DOPA dioxygenase is a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the plant pigment betalain [[cite:PUB00027910], [cite:PUB00099570]]. Homologues of DODA are present not only in betalain-producing plants, but also in bacteria and archaea [[cite:PUB00080818]]. This enzyme is a member of the class III extradiol dioxygenase family, a group of enzymes which use a non-heme Fe(II) to cleave aromatic rings between a hydroxylated carbon and an adjacent non-hydroxylated carbon.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07363" "The Class III extradiol dioxygenase, 4,5-DOPA Dioxygenase, catalyzes the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into 4,5-dihydroxy-phenylalanine"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006157" "Extradiol aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase, DODA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Extradiol aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase, DODA-type", "short" "Extradiol_dOase_DODA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5130, "taxa" 19364, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21196, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15546}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
