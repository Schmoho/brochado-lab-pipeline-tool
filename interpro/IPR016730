{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the FAU-1 protein from archaea. In Pyrococcus furiosus, FAU-1 (P. furiosus AU-binding), is highly charged, heat-stable protein from that binds specifically to the AU-rich sequence in a loop region of RNA [[cite:PUB00035944], [cite:PUB00156048]].</p>\n\n<p>FAU-1 consists of two domains, N- and C-terminal, and from a structure determined in FAU-1 from Pyrococcus furiosus, it forms a homo-trimer [[cite:PUB00156048]]. The C-terminal domain forms the trimer and each N-terminal domain locates outside of the trimer core. A dinucleotide, pApUp, was bound to the N-terminal domain, indicating that it has the RNA-binding ability and resembles RNase E from Escherichia coli. FAU-1 has been shown to possess an RNase activity against precursor 5S rRNA derived from P. furiosus and T. kodakarensis in the order Thermococcales in vitro [[cite:PUB00091093]]. In Haloferax volcanii, it has been described as a RNase that participates in the maturation of pre-16S rRNA  and renamed to RNase W, comprising the first archaea-specific contributor to archaeal ribosome biogenesis [[cite:PUB00156047]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01910" "Probable ribonuclease FAU-1 [fau-1]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018644" "RNA-binding protein FAU-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding FAU-1", "short" "RNA-bd_FAU-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 141, "taxa" 822, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 634, "sets" 0, "proteins" 634, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 536}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
