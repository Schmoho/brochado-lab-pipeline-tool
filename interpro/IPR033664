{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Post-transcriptional modifications at the anticodon first (wobble) position of tRNA play critical roles in precise decoding of genetic codes.\r\ntRNA 5-carboxymethoxyuridine (cmo5U) methyltransferase (also known as CmoM and SmtA), is a Class I S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (SAM MTase).  It methylates cmo5U to form mcmo5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethoxyuridine) in the presence of S-Adenosyl methionine (AdoMet).  This terminal methylation of mcmo5U contributes to the decoding ability of tRNA(Ala1) [[cite:PUB00079957]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CmoM may form a homodimer, with each subunit containing one molecule each of AdoMet, sulfate, acetate and 2-mercaptoethanol as ligands.
