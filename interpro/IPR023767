{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the transcriptional regulator SgrR, which contains 1 HTH MarR-type DNA-binding domain. SgrR activates the small RNA gene SgrS under glucose-phosphate stress conditions as well as YfdZ. It represses its own transcription under both stress and non-stress conditions. It also might act as a sensor of the intracellular accumulation of phosphoglucose by binding these molecules in its C-terminal solute-binding domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01449" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator SgrR [sgrR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulator SgrR", "short" "Tscrpt_reg_SgrR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 890, "sets" 0, "proteins" 890, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 759}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023767", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039424", "name" "Solute-binding protein family 5", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016880", "name" "ABC-type oligopeptide transport system, solute-binding component, Mycoplasmataceae, predicted", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023767", "name" "Transcriptional regulator SgrR", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030678", "name" "Peptide/nickel binding protein, MppA-type", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011980", "name" "Metal-staphylopine-binding protein CntA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023920", "name" "ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein, KPN01854", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR050017", "name" "Dipeptide ABC transporter periplasmic-binding protein DppA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR050034", "name" "Oligopeptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein Opp4A", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR050035", "name" "Nickel ABC transporter substrate-binding protein NikA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
