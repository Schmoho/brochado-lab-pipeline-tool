{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochromes c (cytC) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes.</p>\n\n<p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC. Class I includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the haem-attachment site towards the N terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C terminus [[cite:PUB00095221]]. On the basis of sequence similarity, class I cytC were further subdivided into five classes, IA to IE. Class IB includes the eukaryotic mitochondrial cyt C and prokaryotic 'short' cyt C2 exemplified by Rhodopila globiformis cyt C2; Class IA includes 'long' cyt C2, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum cyt C2 and Aquaspirillum itersonii cyt C-550, which have several extra loops by comparison with Class IB cyt C.</p>\n\n<p>Class I cytC has a characterised fold which comprises 5 α-helices arranged in a unique tertiary structure and a conserved N-terminal sequence -Cys-Xxx-Xxx-Cys-His- where the cysteines mediate the covalent cross-linking of the heme to the protein and the His [[cite:PUB00095221]].The 3D structures of a considerable number of class IA and IB cytC have been determined. The proteins consist of 3-6 α-helices; the three most conserved 'core' helices form a 'basket' around the haem group, with one haem edge exposed to the solvent. Most class I cytC have conserved aromatic residues clustered around the haem and axial ligands.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ty3", "name" "Crystal structure of K72A variant of Human Cytochrome c"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11961" "CYTOCHROME C"}, "prints" {"PR00604" "CYTCHRMECIAB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c, class IA/ IB", "short" "Cyt_c_1A/1B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 204, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4391, "taxa" 16017, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27813, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22917, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17281}, "pathways" 117}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2021", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2021"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002327", :literature {"PUB00000610" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ambler RP."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
