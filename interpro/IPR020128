{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Secapin; a nontoxic peptide found in the venom of bees and wasps, a serine protease inhibitor which exhibits antifibrinolytic, antielastolytic and antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungi [[cite:PUB00097952]]. It may function in the innate immune response to microbial infection and possibly in the venom, as an antifibrinolytic agent [[cite:PUB00097952]]. Secapin shares a common folding pattern with apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide and tertiapin; it is centred on a β-turn covalently linked to an α-helical segment by one disulphide link (two disulphide links in the other peptides) [[cite:PUB00045928]]. Secapin-2 induces hyperalgesia and edema mediated by leukotrienes when injected into mice and it does not induce hemolytic activity, mast cell degranulation, or chemotactic activity for polymorphonucleated leukocytes (PMNL) [[cite:PUB00097953]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17521" "Honey bee peptides"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secapin", "short" "Secapin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 87, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020128", :literature {"PUB00045928" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hider RC" "Ragnarsson U."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
