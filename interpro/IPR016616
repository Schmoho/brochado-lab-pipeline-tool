Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterised by many features, including retinal degeneration, obesity, cognitive impairment, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, and hypogenitalism. BBS genes play an important role in maintaining leptin sensitivity in proopiomelanocortin neurons [[cite:PUB00043591]]. A relatively high incidence of BBS is found in the mixed Arab populations of Kuwait and in Bedouin tribes throughout the Middle East, most likely due to the high rate of consaguinity in these populations and a founder effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primary cilia are ubiquitous cellular appendages that provide important sensory and signalling functions and their dysfunction underlies numerous human genetic disorders. The proteins disrupted in the human ciliary disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are required for the localisation of G protein-coupled receptors to primary cilia on central neurons. The alteration of signalling caused by mislocalisation of ciliary signalling proteins underlies the BBS phenotype [[cite:PUB00043592]]. Of the 12 known BBS genes, BBS1 is the most commonly mutated [[cite:PUB00043593]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32465" "BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 2 PROTEIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF013684" "Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 protein", "short" "Bardet-Biedl_syndrome_2_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1061, "taxa" 4253, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2641, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2399, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1552}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016616", :literature {"PUB00070006" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Seo S" "Guo DF" "Bugge K" "Morgan DA" "Rahmouni K" "Sheffield VC."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
