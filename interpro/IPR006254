{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Isocitrate lyase ([ec:4.1.3.1]) [[cite:PUB00005064], [cite:PUB00002339]] is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to succinate and glyoxylate. This is the first step in the glyoxylate bypass, an alternative to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the TCA cycle) in bacteria, fungi and plants. A cysteine, a histidine and a glutamate or aspartate have been found to be important for the enzyme's catalytic activity. Only one cysteine residue is conserved between the sequences of the fungal, plant and bacterial enzymes; it is located in the middle of a conserved hexapeptide.</p>\n\n<p>Mitochondrial 2-methylisocitrate lyase ICL2 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not act on isocitrate but on 2-methylisocitrate. It catalyses the formation of pyruvate and succinate during the metabolism of endogenous propionyl-CoA [[cite:PUB00100290]]. Methylisocitrate lyase, mitochondrial from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is responsible for the same reaction [[cite:PUB00100291]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3lg3", "name" "1.4A Crystal Structure of Isocitrate Lyase from Yersinia pestis CO92"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015813", "name" "Pyruvate/Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR040442", "name" "Pyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001362" "Isocitrate lyase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01346" "isocitrate lyase"}, "panther" {"PTHR21631" "ISOCITRATE LYASE/MALATE SYNTHASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00463" "Isocitrate lyase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isocitrate lyase", "short" "Isocitrate_lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 105, "proteomes" 5335, "taxa" 19744, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22359, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21707, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16229}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0023", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0023"} {"accession" "GenProp1265", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1265"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
