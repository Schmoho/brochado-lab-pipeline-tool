{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists Drosophila chorion proteins S36 and S38, which are involved in chorion membrane formation. The proteins consist of a central domain and two flanking 'arms'. The central domain contains tandemly repetitive peptides, which apparently generate a secondary structure of β-sheet strands alternating with β-turns, most probably, forming a twisted β-pleated sheet or β-barrel [[cite:PUB00055599]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05387" "Chorion family 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chorion S36/S38", "short" "Chorion_S36/S28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 218, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 131, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 118}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008449", :literature {"PUB00055599" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Hamodrakas SJ" "Batrinou A" "Christophoratou T."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
