{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of inositol monophosphatases (IMPases) mainly from bacteria.  E. coli SuhB is part of the rRNA transcription anti-termination complex (rrnTAC) that prevents rho-dependent termination. The rrnTAC consists of Nus factors A, B, E and G, ribosomal protein S4 and inositol mono-phosphatase SuhB.  SuhB directly binds a C-terminal acidic repeat domain of NusA and contacts at least one other region in NusA as well as the nut-like RNA signal element. It thereby facilitates entry of the NusB/E dimer into an rrnTAC [[cite:PUB00095610]].</p>\n\n<p>E. coli SuhB has D,L-inositol-1-monophosphatase and beta-glycerophosphatase activity [[cite:PUB00053644]]. However,  E.coli makes very low amounts of myo-inositol-containing phospholipids, so the catalytic necessity for this enzyme is low [[cite:PUB00095608]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (1PTASE) and inositol monophosphatase (MPTASE) are enzymes of the inositol signalling pathway that share similar enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00004864]]. Both enzymes exhibit an absolute requirement for metal ions (Mg2+ is preferred), and both are uncompetitively inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of Li+. Their amino acid sequences contain a number of conserved motifs, which are also shared by several other proteins related to MPTASE (including products of fungal QaX and qutG, bacterial suhB and cysQ, and yeast hal2) [[cite:PUB00004864]].</p>\n\n<p>Structural analysis of these proteins has revealed a common core of 155 residues: the core comprises 5 α-helices and 11 β-strands, and includes residues essential for metal binding and catalysis. While the core has been conserved, presumably to impart catalytic function, the loops and regions of structure outside the core have evolved unique regulatory domains [[cite:PUB00004864]].</p>\n\n<p>An interesting property of the enzymes of this family is their sensitivity to Li+ at levels achieved in patients undergoing therapy for manic depression. The targets and mechanism of action of Li+ are unknown, but over-active inositol phosphate signalling may account for symptoms of the disease [[cite:PUB00000822], [cite:PUB00032773]]. It has been proposed that these Li+-sensitive proteins could represent targets for Li+ in manic depressive disease [[cite:PUB00004864], [cite:PUB00032773], [cite:PUB00046132]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01959" "SuhB family inositol monophosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inositol monophosphatase SuhB-like", "short" "Inositol_monophosphatase_SuhB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4440, "taxa" 18190, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 70660, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20448, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15782}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
