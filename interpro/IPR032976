{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of the YjeF N-terminal domain-containing proteins from eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, including NAXE and YJEFN3 from humans [[cite:PUB00094579]]. NAXE is an NAD(P)H-hydrate epimerase that has been shown to regulate cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00094580]].  YJEFN3 may play a role in spermiogenesis and oogenesis [[cite:PUB00077304]].</p>\n\n<p>In bacteria or archaea, YjeF N-terminal domains are often fused to a YjeF C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00060794]]. It is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyses the epimerisation of the S- and R-forms of NAD(P)HX and the dehydration of the S-form of NAD(P)HX at the expense of ADP, which is converted to AMP [[cite:PUB00060794]]. However, this entry represents the subgroup that only contain the YjeF N-terminal domain.</p>\n\n<p>The reduced forms of NAD and NADP, two major nucleotides playing a central role in metabolism, are continuously damaged by enzymatic or heat-dependent hydration. Eukaryotic NAD(P)H-hydrate epimerase catalyses the epimerisation of the S- and R-forms of NAD(P)HX, the damaged form of NAD(P)H. This is a prerequisite for the S-specific NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase to allow the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX [[cite:PUB00060794]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jzt", "name" "Crystal structure of yeast ynu0, YNL200c"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036652", "name" "YjeF N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13232" "NAD(P)H-HYDRATE EPIMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YjeF N-terminal domain-containing protein NAXE-like", "short" "YJEFN_prot_NAXE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2473, "taxa" 9377, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6079, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6079, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4192}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
