{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RS21-C6 proteins (also known as dCTP pyrophosphatases 1, DCTPP1) are NTP pyrophosphatases that structurally belong to the group of all-Î± NTP pyrophosphatases [[cite:PUB00079689], [cite:PUB00079704]]. They show significant sequence similarity to the dimeric 2-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTP pyrophosphatase or dUTPase) and NTP-PPase MazG proteins [[cite:PUB00042205]]. However, unlike typical tandem-domain MazG proteins, RS21-C6 contains a single MazG-like domain and functions as a tetramer (a dimer of dimers) with a typical four-helical bundle. Divalent ions, such as Mg2+, are required for its pyrophosphatase activity [[cite:PUB00080470]]. Human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 has been shown to be involved in nucleotide homoeostasis, contributing to detoxification of deoxycytidine triphosphate derivatives [[cite:PUB00080471]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4qgp", "name" "Crystal structure of a pyrophosphatase (AF1178) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSM 4304 at 1.80 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11537" "Nucleoside Triphosphate Pyrophosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.8) MazG-like domain found in mouse RS21-C6 protein and its homologs"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029826" "Predicted pyrophosphohydrolase, MazG-related, RS21-C6 type"}, "pfam" {"PF12643" "MazG-like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "dCTP pyrophosphatase 1", "short" "DCTPP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 65, "proteomes" 3219, "taxa" 13706, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13065, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13052, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9524}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
