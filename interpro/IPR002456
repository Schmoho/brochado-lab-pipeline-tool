{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GPCR family 3 receptors (also known as family C) are structurally similar to other GPCRs, but do not show any significant sequence similarity and thus represent a distinct group. Structurally they are composed of four elements; an N-terminal signal sequence; a large hydrophilic extracellular agonist-binding region containing several conserved cysteine residues which could be involved in disulphide bonds; a shorter region containing seven transmembrane domains; and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of variable length [[cite:PUB00036049]]. Family 3 members include the metabotropic glutamate receptors, the extracellular calcium-sensing receptors, the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) type B  receptors, and the vomeronasal type-2 receptors [[cite:PUB00004309], [cite:PUB00004161], [cite:PUB00036050], [cite:PUB00007343]]. As these receptors regulate many important physiological processes they are potentially promising targets for drug development.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and signals through ionotropic (type A and type C) and metabotropic (type B) receptor systems. The type B receptors have been cloned, and photoaffinity labelling experiments suggest that they correspond to two highly conserved receptor forms in the vertebrate nervous system [[cite:PUB00005965]]. These receptors are involved in the fine tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission [[cite:PUB00005966]]. Presynaptic receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, while postsynaptic receptors decrease neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials [[cite:PUB00005966]]. The type B receptors negatively couple to adenylyl cyclase and show sequence similarity to the metabotropic receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate.
