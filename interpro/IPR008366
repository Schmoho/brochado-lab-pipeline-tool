{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Antigenic stimulation of T lymphocytes initiates a complex series of intracellular signal transduction pathways that leads to the expression of a panel of immunoregulatory genes, whose function is critical to the initiation and coordination of the immune response. The multi-subunit nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor family plays a pivotal role in this process and is involved in the expression of a number of immunologically important genes. These include the cytokines IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, as well as several cell-surface molecules, such as CD40L and FasL. Although originally described in T cells, it is now apparent that NFAT proteins are also expressed in other immune system cells, including B cells, mast cells, basophils and natural killer cells, as well as in a variety of non-immune cell types and tissues, such as skeletal muscle, neurons, heart and adipocytes. However, although NFAT acts as a calcium-dependent transcription factor and serves to couple gene expression to changes in intracellular calcium levels in most cases, NFAT target genes have not been identified in these latter cell types.</p>\n\n<p>NFAT proteins appear to be regulated primarily at the level of their subcellular localisation [[cite:PUB00011687]]. They are found exclusively in the cytoplasm of resting T cells, and consist of 2 components: a pre-existing cytoplasmic component that translocates into the nucleus on calcium mobilisation, and an inducible nuclear component comprising members of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors. In response to antigen receptor signalling, the calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin acts directly to dephosphorylate NFAT proteins, causing their rapid translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they cooperatively bind their target.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8r3f", "name" "C-terminal Rel-homology Domain of NFAT1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12533" "NFAT"}, "prints" {"PR01789" "NUCFACTORATC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)", "short" "NFAT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 903, "taxa" 3614, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8856, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8269, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4215}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008366", :literature {"PUB00011687" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Porter CM" "Havens MA" "Clipstone NA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
