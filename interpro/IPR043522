{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor protein (DDIAS), also known as Noxin (Nitric oxide inducible), which is an anti-apoptotic protein involved in DNA repair and cell survival. This protein is induced by a wide range of stressors but it has been shown that it acts when there is DNA damage, suppressing cell death in order to prevent from DNA lesions [[cite:PUB00094153], [cite:PUB00094152]]. This protein is highly expressed in cancer tissues and cells, being a potential therapeutic target in cancer. Recently, it has been demonstrated that DDIAS knockdown caused growth inhibition of lung cancer cells. As it is constitutively activated in malignant cancers, this confirms its utility as therapeutic target [[cite:PUB00094154]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35537" "DNA DAMAGE-INDUCIBLE APOPTOSIS SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN DDIAS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor protein", "short" "DDIAS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 656, "taxa" 2291, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 988, "sets" 0, "proteins" 988, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 695}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043522", :literature {"PUB00094154" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Im JY" "Kim BK" "Lee KW" "Chun SY" "Kang MJ" "Won M."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogenesis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogenesis", "title" "DDIAS promotes STAT3 activation by preventing STAT3 recruitment to PTPRM in lung cancer cells.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31900385}, "PUB00094152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Nakaya N" "Hemish J" "Krasnov P" "Kim SY" "Stasiv Y" "Michurina T" "Herman D" "Davidoff MS" "Middendorff R" "Enikolopov G."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
