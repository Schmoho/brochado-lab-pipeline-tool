{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase proenzyme and similar sequences mainly found in prokaryotes. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD, [ec:4.1.1.65]) is synthesised as a single chain precursor. Generation of the pyruvoyl active site from a Ser is coupled to cleavage of a Gly-Ser bond between the larger (beta) and smaller (alpha chains). This enzyme catalyses the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from phosphatidylserine (PtdSer).
