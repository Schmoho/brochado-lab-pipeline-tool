{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tryptophan 5-monooxygenase ([ec:1.14.16.4]) is a member of the family of tetrameric, biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases found in metazoans. It is closely related to tetrameric phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and more distantly related to the monomeric phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase found in some Gram-negative bacteria. It is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin in the central nervous system and catalyzes the first step of the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland [[cite:PUB00033171]].<reaction>L-tryptophan + tetrahydropteridine + O2 = 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan + dihydropteridine + H2O</reaction></p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5l01", "name" "Tryptophan 5-hydroxylase in complex with inhibitor (3~{S})-8-[2-azanyl-6-[(1~{R})-1-(4-chloranyl-2-phenyl-phenyl)-2,2,2-tris(fluoranyl)ethoxy]pyrimidin-4-yl]-2,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-3-carboxylic acid"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036951", "name" "Aromatic amino acid hydroxylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036329", "name" "Aromatic amino acid monoxygenase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01270" "tryptophan 5-monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tryptophan 5-monooxygenase", "short" "Trp_5_mOase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 759, "taxa" 2907, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2238, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2238, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1392}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1695", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1695"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
