{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ketosamines derive from a non-enzymatic reaction between a sugar and a protein [[cite:PUB00035935]]. Ketosamine-3-kinases (KT3K), of which fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is the best-known example, catalyse the phosphorylation of the ketosamine moiety of glycated proteins. The instability of a phosphorylated ketosamine leads to its degradation, and KT3K is thus thought to be involved in protein repair [[cite:PUB00035936]].</p>\n\n<p>The function of the prokaryotic members of this group has not been established. However, several lines of evidence indicate that they may function as fructosamine-3-kinases (FN3K). First, they are similar to characterised FN3K from mouse and human. Second, the Escherichia coli members are found in close proximity on the genome to fructose-6-phosphate kinase (PfkB). Last, FN3K activity has been found in a Anacystis montana (Gloeocapsa montana Kutzing 1843) [[cite:PUB00010999]], indicating such activity-directly demonstrated in eukaryotes-is nonetheless not confined to eukaryotes.</p>\n\n<p>This family includes eukaryotic fructosamine-3-kinase enzymes [[cite:PUB00008463]] which may initiate a process leading to the deglycation of fructoselysine and of glycated proteins and in the phosphorylation of 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose, fructoselysine, fructoseglycine, fructose and glycated lysozyme. The family also includes bacterial members that have not been characterised but probably have a similar or identical function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3f7w", "name" "Crystal structure of putative fructosamine-3-kinase (YP_290396.1) from THERMOBIFIDA FUSCA YX-ER1 at 1.85 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12149" "FRUCTOSAMINE 3 KINASE-RELATED PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF03881" "Fructosamine kinase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006221" "Ketosamine-3-kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fructosamine/Ketosamine-3-kinase", "short" "Fructo-/Ketosamine-3-kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 153, "proteomes" 5087, "taxa" 18831, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18318, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18122, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13004}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
