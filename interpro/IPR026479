{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family, including sublancin, are post-ribosomal natural products (PRNP) with an S-linked glycosylation. Sublancin itself also has two disulfide bonds. Sublancin is a 37-amino acid antimicrobial peptide belonging to the glycocin family [[cite:PUB00088068]].

Sublancin was thought to be a lantibiotic but was later shown to be an S-linked glycopeptide [[cite:PUB00060499], [cite:PUB00094614]]. Glycosylation is essential for its antimicrobial activity. Sublancin is biosynthesised as a precursor peptide bearing an N-terminal leader peptide, and a C-terminal core peptide that is converted into the mature peptide [[cite:PUB00060499]]. Sublancin comprises two Î± helices and a well-defined inter-helical loop [[cite:PUB00094615]]. Sublancin inhibits B.cereus spore outgrowth, after the germination stage, approximately 1000-fold better than it inhibits exponential growth of the same cells and inhibits B.subtilis strain ATCC6633 and B. megaterium strain 14581 [[cite:PUB00094614]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19151" "Sublancin"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04196" "sublancin family glycopeptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycopeptide, sublancin family", "short" "Glycopep_SunS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 43, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1003", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1003"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026479", :literature {"PUB00060499" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Oman TJ" "Boettcher JM" "Wang H" "Okalibe XN" "van der Donk WA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
