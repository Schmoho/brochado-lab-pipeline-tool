{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains a family of small protein of unknown function.  Proteins in this family are found in Firmicutes. These proteins adopt a β-sheet structure with four strands with an α-helix packed on one face between the second and third strands. Using AlphaFold we can identify a likely hexameric ring complex. Additionally these proteins likely form a cap on a goblet like hexameric complex of [interpro:IPR025918]. Analysis of genomic context suggests this larger complex is involved in spore germination and possibly phospholipid synthesis or regulation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21835" "Capping complex subunit for YIEGIA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YpzH protein family", "short" "YpzH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 394, "taxa" 1309, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1168, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1168, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 888}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054055", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054055", "name" "YpzH protein family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 84, "alignment:full" 421}}}
