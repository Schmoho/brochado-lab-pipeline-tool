{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) catalyses the final step in triacylglycerol synthesis by using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates. In plants, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1, TAG1) is a major enzyme for oil accumulation in seeds. It has complementary functions with PDAT1 acyltransferase that are essential for triacylglycerol synthesis and normal development of both seeds and pollen [[cite:PUB00063495], [cite:PUB00063492], [cite:PUB00063493], [cite:PUB00063494], [cite:PUB00063496]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In mammals, DGAT1 is a multifunctional acyltransferase capable of synthesizing diacylglycerol, retinyl, and wax esters in addition to triacylglycerol [[cite:PUB00063498]]. In liver, it plays a role in esterifying exogenous fatty acids to glycerol [[cite:PUB00063505]]. It also functions as the major acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase in the skin, where it acts to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid toxicity leading to skin and hair disorders [[cite:PUB00063499]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500231" "Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1", "short" "Diacylglycerol_acylTrfase1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 688, "taxa" 3300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2076, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1896, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1099}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
