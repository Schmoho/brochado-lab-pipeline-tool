{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This tightly conserved subfamily of the bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) family, with members showing more than 60 % pairwise sequence identity, includes proteins from both species with and without the ability to make coenzyme F420. Therefore, the likely cofactor is FMN rather than F420. The presence of three members in Kineococcus radiotolerans SRS30216 and two in Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338 suggests a closely related subfamily rather than exactly conserved function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04036" "CE1758 family FMN-dependent luciferase-like monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Luciferase-like monooxygenase, FMN-dependent, putative", "short" "LLM_FMN-dep_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1470, "taxa" 4045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3870, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3870, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2980}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023934", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023934", "name" "Luciferase-like monooxygenase, FMN-dependent, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
