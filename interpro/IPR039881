{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PCIF1 is a cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase that catalyzes formation of N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine cap (m6A(m)) by methylating the adenosine at the second transcribed position of capped mRNAs [[cite:PUB00092434]]. It contains a WW domain that interacts with phosphorylated RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD).
