{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonuclease P ([ec:3.1.26.5]) (RNase P) [[cite:PUB00002604], [cite:PUB00002589], [cite:PUB00004402]] is a site specific endonuclease that generates mature tRNAs by catalysing the removal of the 5'-leader sequence from pre-tRNA to produce the mature 5'-terminus. It can also cleave other RNA substrates such as 4.5S RNA. In bacteria RNase P is known to be composed of two components: a large RNA (about 400 base pairs) encoded by rnpB, and a small protein (119 to 133 amino acids) encoded by rnpA. The RNA moiety of RNase P carries the catalytic activity; the protein component plays an auxiliary, but essential, role in vivo by binding to the 5'-leader sequence and broadening the substrate specificity of the ribozyme. The sequence of rnpA is not highly conserved, however there is, in the central part of the protein, a conserved basic region.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6max", "name" "Crystal structure of Ribonuclease P protein from Thermotoga maritima in complex with purpurin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR020568", "name" "Ribosomal protein uS5 domain 2-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR014721", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5 domain 2-type fold, subgroup", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33992" "RIBONUCLEASE P PROTEIN COMPONENT"}, "hamap" {"MF_00227" "Ribonuclease P protein component [rnpA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00188" "ribonuclease P protein component, bacterial type"}, "pfam" {"PF00825" "Ribonuclease P"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease P", "short" "RNase_P"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 27, "proteomes" 8684, "taxa" 34973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39725, "sets" 0, "proteins" 39724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30492}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00558", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00558"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1360", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1360"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
