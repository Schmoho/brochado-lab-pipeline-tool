{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PrsW, appears to be a member of a widespread family of membrane proteins that includes at least one previously known protease. PrsW appears to be responsible for Site-1 cleavage of the RsiW anti-sigma factor, the cognate anti-sigma factor, and it senses antimicrobial peptides that damage the cell membrane and other agents that cause cell envelope stress, the three acidic residues, E75, E76 and E95 in B7GHM8 appear to be crucial since their mutation to alanine renders the protein inactive. Based on predictions of the bioinformatics programme TMHMM it is likely that these residues are located on the extracytoplasmic face of PrsW placing them in a position to act as a sensor for cell envelope stress [[cite:PUB00054608]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13367" "PrsW family intramembrane metalloprotease"}, "panther" {"PTHR36844" "PROTEASE PRSW"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intramembrane metalloprotease PrsW", "short" "PrsW"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 93, "proteomes" 3121, "taxa" 12824, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16351, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16319, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12245}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026898", :literature {"PUB00054608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Ellermeier CD" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1440606", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Evidence for a novel protease governing regulated intramembrane proteolysis and resistance to antimicrobial peptides in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1911-22", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16816000}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008233", "name" "peptidase activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026898", "name" "Intramembrane metalloprotease PrsW", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023596", "name" "Peptidase PrsW, archaeal/bacterial", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 56, "alignment:full" 4115}}}
