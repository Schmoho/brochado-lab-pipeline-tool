The activated sulphur group is then transferred to TusE (DsrC), then by MnmA (TrmU) for modification of an anticodon nucleotide in tRNAs for Glu, Lys, and Gln [[cite:PUB00040153]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sulphur relay complex TusBCD is also found, under the designation DsrEFH, in phototrophic and chemotrophic sulphur bacteria, such as Chromatium vinosum or Chlorobium tepidum [[cite:PUB00086971]].
