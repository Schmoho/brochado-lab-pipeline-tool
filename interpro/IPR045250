{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent s a group of co-chaperone proteins, including p23 (also known as Sba1) from budding yeasts, Wos2 from fission yeasts, prostaglandin E synthase 3 from humans and Atp23-1/2 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00098365]]. p23 contains a folded domain and a long unstructured C-terminal tail. p23 and its homologues are co-chaperones of Hsp90 [[cite:PUB00098367], [cite:PUB00098366]] and may be part of the core chaperone cycle required for efficient client activation [[cite:PUB00098368]].
