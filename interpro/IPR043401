{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The GDNF family members (consists of GDNF, neurturin, artemin and persephin) are structurally similar to transforming growth factor-beta.  Unlike other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, which signal through the receptor serine-threonine kinases, GDNF family ligands activate intracellular signalling cascades via the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. GDNF family ligands binds to GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRalpha) and then the GDNF family ligand-GFRalpha complex binds to and stimulates autophosphorylation of Ret. For instance, GDNF binds to GFRalpha1, Neurturin binds to GFRalpha2, artemin to GFRalpha3 and persephin activates Ret by binding to GFRalpha4. The GDNF family members support the survival of dopamine neurons and motoneurons, and some of them also regulate the development of enteric, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons [[cite:PUB00093930]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5nmz", "name" "human Neurturin (97-197)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12173" "GDNF SUBFAMILY OF TGF-BETA FAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family", "short" "GDNF_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 647, "taxa" 2179, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2957, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2957, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2016}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043401", :literature {"PUB00093937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5457", "authors" ["Meng X" "Lindahl M" "Hyvonen ME" "Parvinen M" "de Rooij DG" "Hess MW" "Raatikainen-Ahokas A" "Sainio K" "Rauvala H" "Lakso M" "Pichel JG" "Westphal H" "Saarma M" "Sariola H."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Regulation of cell fate decision of undifferentiated spermatogonia by GDNF.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1489-93", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10688798}, "PUB00093936" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6767", "authors" ["Ramer MS" "Priestley JV" "McMahon SB."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Functional regeneration of sensory axons into the adult spinal cord.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "312-6", "volume" "403", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10659850}, "PUB00093935" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6586", "authors" ["Pichel JG" "Shen L" "Sheng HZ" "Granholm AC" "Drago J" "Grinberg A" "Lee EJ" "Huang SP" "Saarma M" "Hoffer BJ" "Sariola H" "Westphal H."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Defects in enteric innervation and kidney development in mice lacking GDNF.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "73-6", "volume" "382", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8657307}, "PUB00093930" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Saarma M."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
