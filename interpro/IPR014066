{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing oxidoreductases, including Arsenite oxidase subunit AioA from Alcaligenes faecalis and Iodate reductase subunit IdrA from Pseudomonas sp. AioA is the large subunit of an arsenite oxidase complex in which the small subunit is a Rieske protein. This enzyme acts in energy metabolism by arsenite oxidation, rather than detoxification by reduction of arsenate to arsenite prior to export [[cite:PUB00034441]]. Its homologue IdrA is thought to catalyse the reduction of iodate (IO3-) to hypoiodous acid (HIO) and H2O2, using a reduced cytochrome c as the electron donor [[cite:PUB00100773], [cite:PUB00100802]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8cgs", "name" "Crystal structure of arsenite oxidase from Alcaligenes faecalis (Af Aio) bound to antimony oxyanion"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02693" "arsenate reductase (azurin) large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenite oxidase subunit AioA/Iodate reductase subunit IdrA, large subunit", "short" "AioA/IdrA_lsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 169, "taxa" 1245, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1864, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1682}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0473", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0473"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
