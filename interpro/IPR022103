{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6 (BIRC6, also known as BRUCE) is an anti-apoptotic protein which can regulate cell death by controlling caspases and by acting as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase [[cite:PUB00047485]]. It has an unusual ubiquitin conjugation system in that it could combine in a single polypeptide, ubiquitin conjugating (E2) with ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity, forming a chimeric E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase [[cite:PUB00069151]]. It is crucial for normal vesicle targeting to the site of abscission, but also for the integrity of the midbody and the midbody ring, and its striking ubiquitin modification [[cite:PUB00069152]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12356" "Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6", "short" "BIRC6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 707, "taxa" 2913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1905, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1904, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
