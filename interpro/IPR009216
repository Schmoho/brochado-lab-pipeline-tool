It has been shown in Salmonella enterica that<i>srfB</i>is one of the genes activated by the global signal transduction/regulatory system SsrA/B [[cite:PUB00013646]].

The activated genes include pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) genes and at least 10 other genes (<i>srfB</i>is one of them) which are believed to be horizontally acquired, and to be involved in virulence/pathogenicity [[cite:PUB00013646]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF034585" "Predicted virulence protein SrfB"}, "pfam" {"PF07520" "Virulence factor SrfB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Virulence factor SrfB", "short" "Virulence_factor_SrfB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 203, "taxa" 1934, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2263, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2235, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1715}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009216", :literature {"PUB00013646" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Worley MJ" "Ching KH" "Heffron F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
