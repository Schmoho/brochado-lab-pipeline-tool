This entry represents NADP-reducing hydrogenase subunit HndA from D.fructosivorans and similar prokaryotic sequences, such as HydC that acts as a bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase, which uses the exergonic oxidation of reduced ferredoxin to drive the unfavorable oxidation of NADH to produce H2 [[cite:PUB00103898]].
