{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Lepidopteran low molecular weight (30kDa) lipoproteins (30KPs), which belong to the Lipoprotein 11 family. They are abundant proteins found in the hemolymph, mainly synthesized in the fat body and then secreted into the hemolymph during the last instar larval stage. They have very similar amino acid and nucleotide sequences which are also similar to those of microvitellogenin in Manduca sexta [[cite:PUB00096630]]. Structure resolution of some of its members revealed that they belong to the β-sheet superfamily and share a characteristic fold, with differences in loop conformations thought to confer ligand specificity [[cite:PUB00096630], [cite:PUB00096631]].</p>\n\n<p>Studies from Bombyx mori, showed that these proteins function as storage proteins during growth and development but they are used only during embryonic development, thought to act as storage units of amino acids for use in de novo synthesis of other proteins. They are also involved in energy transport and metabolic processes such as release of diacylglycerol and the transport of steroids and hormones. 30KPs may be involved in defense response mechanisms as they can be conjugated to glucose, dextran, maltose and glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00096630]]. These proteins may also inhibit apoptosis, thereby having a role in cell survival [[cite:PUB00096630], [cite:PUB00096629]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4efp", "name" "Bombyx mori lipoprotein 7 isolated from its natural source at 1.33 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042046", "name" "Lepidopteran low molecular weight lipoprotein, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03260" "Lepidopteran low molecular weight (30 kD) lipoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lepidopteran low molecular weight lipoprotein", "short" "Lipoprotein_11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 244, "sets" 0, "proteins" 242, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 152}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004943", :literature {"PUB00096630" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Shi XF" "Li YN" "Yi YZ" "Xiao XG" "Zhang ZF."], "ISO_journal" "J Insect Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Insect Sci", "title" "Identification and Characterization of 30 K Protein Genes Found in Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) Transcriptome.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26078299}, "PUB00096629" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Song HY" "Kim MY" "Kim BY" "Park SW" "Sung DK" "Kang PD" "Park C" "Jeon SH" "Lee BH."], "ISO_journal" "J Insect Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Insect Physiol", "title" "Increase of 30K protein in identified motoneurons by hemolymph results in inhibition of programmed cell death in silkworm, Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera, Bombycidae).", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "756-62", "volume" "58", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22414538}, "PUB00096631" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Pietrzyk AJ" "Bujacz A" "Lochynska M" "Jaskolski M" "Bujacz G."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Crystal structure of Bombyx mori lipoprotein 6: comparative structural analysis of the 30-kDa lipoprotein family.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e108761", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25379889}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005576", "name" "extracellular region", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004943", "name" "Lepidopteran low molecular weight lipoprotein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 141}}}
