{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This FAD-dependent monooxygenase family consists of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of various fungal secondary metabolites, including meroterpenoids, indole-diterpenes, and polyketides. These metabolites often exhibit bioactive properties such as mycotoxicity, immunosuppression, and inhibition of mammalian ion channels or enzymes. Family members catalyse critical oxidation steps, including epoxidation, hydroxylation, and oxidative rearrangements, which are essential for constructing complex molecular architectures and functional groups. The versatility of these enzymes allows for the generation of diverse metabolites through regio- and stereo-specific modifications, contributing to the metabolic richness of fungal species [[cite:PUB00154919], [cite:PUB00087463], [cite:PUB00155054]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47356" "FAD-DEPENDENT MONOOXYGENASE ASQG-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAD-dependent monooxygenase, fungal", "short" "FAD_mOase_fung"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 621, "taxa" 1582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6273, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6273, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2688}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR050562", :literature {"PUB00087463" {"URL" nil, "issue" "43", "authors" ["Matsuda Y" "Wakimoto T" "Mori T" "Awakawa T" "Abe I."], "ISO_journal" "J.
