{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is one of the key enzymes in the citric acid cycle, facilitating both the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and replenishing levels of oxalacetate by reductive carboxylation of pyruvate [[cite:PUB00021813]]. There are several isoforms of MDH, differing in their subcellular localization and their specificity for the cofactor NAD or NADP [[cite:PUB00080844]].
