{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small family of proteins found in gammaproteobacteria that are part of MksBEF complex, including MksB. This complex is involved in structural chromosome maintenance [[cite:PUB00106028]]. MksB, together with SMC, is essential during ocular infections. Inactivation of MksB, whether in the presence or absence of SMC, impairs biofilm formation and facilitates planktonic growth [[cite:PUB00151027]]. In addition, inactivation of MksB and SMC reduces the production of virulence factors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040857" "Mks condensin complex protein MksB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mks condensin complex protein MksB, putative", "short" "MksB_put-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 55, "taxa" 697, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 916, "sets" 0, "proteins" 916, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 734}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047720", :literature {"PUB00106028" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zhao H" "Clevenger AL" "Coburn PS" "Callegan MC" "Rybenkov VV."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Condensins are essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal virulence through their control of lifestyle and virulence programs.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "937-957", "volume" "117", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35072315}, "PUB00151027" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Zhao H" "Clevenger AL" "Ritchey JW" "Zgurskaya HI" "Rybenkov VV."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Pseudomonas aeruginosa Condensins Support Opposite Differentiation States.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "2936-2944", "volume" "198", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27528506}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047720", "name" "Mks condensin complex protein MksB, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
