{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The noncyclic N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK-NC) catalyzes the phosphorylation of the Î³-COOH group of N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG) by ATP in the second step of microbial arginine biosynthesis using the acetylated, noncyclic route of ornithine biosynthesis. There are two variants of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. In this one, typified by the pathway in Escherichia coli, glutamate is acetylated by acetyl-CoA and acetylornithine is deacylated hydrolytically. In this pathway, feedback inhibition by arginine occurs at the initial acetylation of glutamate and not at the phosphorylation of NAG by NAGK. The Escherichia coli NAGK is a homodimer [[cite:PUB00028577], [cite:PUB00091740], [cite:PUB00029439], [cite:PUB00091741], [cite:PUB00091742], [cite:PUB00075526]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gs5", "name" "N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase from Escherichia coli complexed with its substrate N-acetylglutamate and its substrate analog AMPPNP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036393", "name" "Acetylglutamate kinase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04249" "AAK_NAGK-NC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase, noncyclic", "short" "NAGK-NC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 132, "taxa" 1376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1435, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1076}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
