{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains the Sec10 component (approximately 650 residues long) of the eukaryotic exocyst complex, which mediates the tethering of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and promotes the assembly of the SNARE complex for membrane fusion [[cite:PUB00013127], [cite:PUB00100040], [cite:PUB00100048]]. It is also involved in cell polarisation, primary ciliogenesis, cytokinesis, pathogen invasion, tumorigenesis and metastasis. The exocyst is a member of the Complex Associated with Tethering Containing Helical Rods (CATCHRs) which also includes DSL1, COG and GARP complexes, evolutionary related. They share structural features comprising Î±-helical bundles towards the C-terminal and coiled-coil regions at the N-terminal. It also includes Recyclin-1 and protein Pof6. Recyclin-1 is involved in recycling plasma membrane proteins internalized by endocytosis [[cite:PUB00059255], [cite:PUB00059256]]. Pof6, together with skp1, is essential for septum processing and cell separation [[cite:PUB00059257]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12100" "SEC10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exocyst complex component Sec10-like", "short" "Sec10-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2550, "taxa" 8590, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6734, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6734, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4275}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009976", :literature {"PUB00059255" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wiederkehr A" "Avaro S" "Prescianotto-Baschong C" "Haguenauer-Tsapis R" "Riezman H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
