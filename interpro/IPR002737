{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is composed of Memo 1 (mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility 1) and related proteins from eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria whose molecular function is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>Memo 1 is an effector of the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase involved in breast carcinoma cell migration [[cite:PUB00044702]]. Its increased expression is associated with cancer aggressiveness. In breast cancer it regulates insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-dependent signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00095224]]. It binds to a specific ErbB2-derived phosphopeptide [[cite:PUB00050589]]. It regulates the localisation of the small G protein RhoA and its effector mDia1 at the plasma membrane, and thereby coordinates the organisation of the lamellipodial actin network, adhesion site formation, and MT outgrowth within the cell leading edge to sustain cell motility [[cite:PUB00069556]]. In yeast, the homologue is known as Mho1, and inhibits haploid invasive growth when overexpressed [[cite:PUB00069557]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7m8h", "name" "Structure of Memo1 C244S metal binding site mutant at 1.75A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07361" "Memo (mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility) is co-precipitated with the C terminus of ErbB2, a protein involved in cell motility"}, "hamap" {"MF_00055" "MEMO1 family protein <locus_tag>"}, "pfam" {"PF01875" "Memo-like protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR11060" "PROTEIN MEMO1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MEMO1 family", "short" "MEMO1_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 99, "proteomes" 3693, "taxa" 16372, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16974, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16970, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12529}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1063", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1063"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002737", :literature {"PUB00044702" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Marone R" "Hess D" "Dankort D" "Muller WJ" "Hynes NE" "Badache A."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
