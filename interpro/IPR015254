{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a set of known and suspected archaeal N-glycosylase/DNA lyases. These DNA repair enzymes are part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway; they protect from oxidative damage by removing the major product of DNA oxidation, 8-oxoguanine (GO), from single- and double-stranded DNA substrates [[cite:PUB00035524]].Cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond between the aberrant base and the sugar-phosphate backbone generates an apurinic (AP) site. Subsequently, the phosphodiester bond 3' from the AP site is cleaved by an elimination reaction, leaving a 3'-terminal unsaturated sugar and a product with a terminal 5'-phosphate. The protein contains two Î±-helical subdomains, with the 8-oxoguanine binding site located in a cleft at their interface. A helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) structural motif and a Gly/Pro-rich sequence followed by a conserved Asp (HhH-GPD motif) are present [[cite:PUB00032495]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7olb", "name" "Crystal structure of Pab-AGOG, an 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase from Pyrococcus abyssi"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011257", "name" "DNA glycosylase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09171" "N-glycosylase/DNA lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-glycosylase/DNA lyase-like", "short" "AGOG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 50, "taxa" 518, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 410, "sets" 0, "proteins" 408, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 358}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
