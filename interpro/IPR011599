{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Prefoldin (PFD) is a chaperone that interacts exclusively with type II chaperonins, hetero-oligomers lacking an obligate co-chaperonin that are found only in eukaryotes (chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide-1 (CCT)) and archaea. Eukaryotic PFD is a multi-subunit complex containing six polypeptides in the molecular mass range of 14-23kDa. In archaea, on the other hand, PFD is composed of two types of subunits, two alpha and four beta. The six subunits associate to form two back-to-back up-and-down eight-stranded barrels, from which hang six coiled coils. Each subunit contributes one (beta subunits) or two (alpha subunits) Î² hairpin turns to the barrels. The coiled coils are formed by the N and C termini of an individual subunit. Overall, this unique arrangement resembles a jellyfish. The eukaryotic PFD hexamer is composed of six different subunits; however, these can be grouped into two alpha-like (PFD3 and -5) and four beta-like (PFD1, -2, -4, and -6) subunits based on amino acid sequence similarity with their archaeal counterparts. Eukaryotic PFD has a six-legged structure similar to that seen in the archaeal homologue [[cite:PUB00013306], [cite:PUB00013187]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the archaeal alpha subunit and the closely related eukaryotic subunit 5.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009053", "name" "Prefoldin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00308" "Prefoldin subunit alpha [pfdA]"}, "panther" {"PTHR12674" "PREFOLDIN SUBUNIT 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prefoldin alpha subunit, archaea-type", "short" "PFD_alpha_archaea"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2517, "taxa" 10225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6808, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6808, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4951}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0246", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0246"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011599", :literature {"PUB00013306" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Siegert R" "Leroux MR" "Scheufler C" "Hartl FU" "Moarefi I."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00165-3", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure of the molecular chaperone prefoldin: unique interaction of multiple coiled coil tentacles with unfolded proteins.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "621-32", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11106732}, "PUB00013187" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Martin-Benito J" "Boskovic J" "Gomez-Puertas P" "Carrascosa JL" "Simons CT" "Lewis SA" "Bartolini F" "Cowan NJ" "Valpuesta JM."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf640", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Structure of eukaryotic prefoldin and of its complexes with unfolded actin and the cytosolic chaperonin CCT.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "6377-86", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12456645}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0051082", "name" "unfolded protein binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006457", "name" "protein folding", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016272", "name" "prefoldin complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004127", "name" "Prefoldin alpha-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003994", "name" "Ubiquitously expressed transcript protein UXT", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011599", "name" "Prefoldin alpha subunit, archaea-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016655", "name" "Prefoldin subunit 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
