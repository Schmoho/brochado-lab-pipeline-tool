{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CcbP is a Ca(2+) binding protein found in bacteria which is thought to bind Ca(2+) by protein surface charge. When bound to Ca(2+), the protein becomes more compact and the level of free calcium decreases. Within the bacteria, Ca(2+) has a role in the early stages of heterocyst differentiation. The free Ca(2+) concentration which is regulated by CcbP is critical for the differentiation process [[cite:PUB00053280]]. Calcium signalling is widespread in bacterial species, and prokaryotic cells like eukaryotes are equipped with all the elements to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis [[cite:PUB00055576]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043067", "name" "Calcium binding protein CcbP, beta-barrel domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11535" "Calcium binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family, calcium binding protein, CcbP", "short" "Uncharacterised_Ca-bd_CcbP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 191, "taxa" 1409, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 927, "sets" 0, "proteins" 927, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 660}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020994", :literature {"PUB00053280" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Zhao Y" "Shi Y" "Zhao W" "Huang X" "Wang D" "Brown N" "Brand J" "Zhao J."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
