{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UDP glycosyltransferases (UGT) are a superfamily of enzymes that catalyse the addition of the glycosyl group from a UDP-sugar to a small hydrophobic molecule. This family currently consist of:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Mammalian UDP-glucuronosyl transferases ([ec:2.4.1.17]) (UDPGT) [[cite:PUB00001112]]. A large family of membrane-bound microsomal enzymes which catalyse the transfer of glucuronic acid to a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous lipophilic substrates. These enzymes are of major importance in the detoxification and subsequent elimination of xenobiotics such as drugs and carcinogens. These enzymes are also involved in cancer progression and drug resistance [[cite:PUB00094545]].</li>\n<li>A large number of putative UDPGT from Caenorhabditis elegans.</li>\n<li>Mammalian 2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase [[cite:PUB00004807]] ([ec:2.4.1.47]) (also known as UDP-galactose-ceramide galactosyltransferase). This enzyme catalyses the transfer of galactose to ceramide, a key enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of galactocerebrosides, which are abundant sphingolipids of the myelin membrane of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system.</li>\n<li>Fungal Sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferase, which is involved in the degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria and nuclei [[cite:PUB00100238]].</li>\n<li>Fungal Enfumafungin synthase efuA [[cite:PUB00100237]]. This protein plays a role in the biosynthesis of enfumafungin, a glycosylated fernene-type triterpenoid with potent antifungal activity.</li>\n<li>Fungal UDP-glycosyltransferase FPY2 that is part of the gene cluster mediating the biosynthesis of the gamma-pyrones fusapyrone (FPY) and deoxyfusapyrone (dFPY) and is probably involved in transfer of 4'-deoxyglucose moiety to C-3.</li>\n<li>Plants Anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase, also known as Flavonol O(3)-glucosyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to a flavanol. This reaction is essential and one of the last steps in anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis.</li>\n<li>Gallate 1-beta-glucosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1.136]), a glucosyltransferase that catalyses the formation of 1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose, the first committed step of hydrolyzable tannins (HTs) biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00097197]].</li>\n<li>(R)-mandelonitrile beta-glucosyltransferase from almond, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glycoside (R)-prunasin (stereo-selective), a precursor of (R)-amygdalin which at high concentrations is associated with bitterness in kernels of almond [[cite:PUB00095588]].</li>\n<li>Baculoviruses ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1]) [[cite:PUB00005121]] (egt). This enzyme catalyses the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ectysteroids which are insect molting hormones. The expression of egt in the insect host interferes with the normal insect development by blocking the molting process.</li>\n<li>Prokaryotic zeaxanthin glucosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1]) (gene crtX), an enzyme involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and that catalyses the glycosylation reaction which converts zeaxanthin to zeaxanthin-beta-diglucoside; Enterobactin C-glucosyltransferase iroB which catalyses the successive monoglucosylation, diglucosylation and triglucosylation of enterobactin decreasing the membrane affinity of Enterobactin and increasing the iron acquisition rate [[cite:PUB00097199], [cite:PUB00097198]].</li>\n<li>Streptomyces macrolide glycosyltransferases ([ec:2.4.1]) [[cite:PUB00001835]]. These enzymes specifically inactivate macrolide antibiotics via 2'-O-glycosylation using UDP-glucose.</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7yf5", "name" "Crystal Structure of the UDPGA Binding Domain of the Human Phase II Metabolizing Enzyme UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 2B10"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03784" "UDP-glycosyltransferases and similar proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF00201" "UDP-glucoronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferase", "short" "UDP_glucos_trans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 203, "domain_architectures" 1065, "proteomes" 5465, "taxa" 21812, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 139652, "sets" 0, "proteins" 136208, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83919}, "pathways" 287}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00359", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00359"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1600", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1600"} {"accession" "GenProp1261", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1261"} {"accession" "GenProp1591", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1591"} {"accession" "GenProp1547", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1547"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
