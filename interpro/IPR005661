{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are integral membrane proteins and includes oxaloacetate decarboxylase beta chain and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase subunit beta. The decarboxylation reactions they catalyse are coupled to the vectorial transport of Na across the cytoplasmic membrane, thereby creating a sodium ion motive force that is used for ATP synthesis [[cite:PUB00016214], [cite:PUB00099625]]. The oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump (OAD) is composed of an alpha subunit which catalyses the carboxyl-transfer from oxaloacetate to biotin, a beta subunit (represented in this entry) which catalyses the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the coupled sodium transport and a gamma subunit subunit which stabilizes the OAD complex by interacting with alpha and beta subunits [[cite:PUB00099625]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35806" "OXALOACETATE DECARBOXYLASE BETA CHAIN 2"}, "pfam" {"PF03977" "Na+-transporting oxaloacetate decarboxylase beta subunit"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015658" "Na(+)-transporting methylmalonyl-CoA/oxaloacetate decarboxylase, beta subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01109" "sodium ion-translocating decarboxylase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Na+-transporting methylmalonyl-CoA/oxaloacetate decarboxylase, beta subunit", "short" "OadB_MmdB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 1743, "taxa" 8509, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17351, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14133}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
