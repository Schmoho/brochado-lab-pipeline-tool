{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of polyprenal reductases, including SRD5A3 from humans, PPRD1 from Arabidopsis and Dfg10 from budding yeasts. SRD5A3 was initially characterised as a polyprenol reductase, mediating the conversion of polyprenol into dolichol [[cite:PUB00089495]]. However, it was later shown to catalyse an intermediate step in this pathway and reduce polyprenal [[cite:PUB00154960]]. Mutations in the SRD5A3 gene cause congenital disorder of glycosylation 1Q, a genetic disease with an extremely broad spectrum of clinical presentations due to defective glycosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids [[cite:PUB00089495], [cite:PUB00089998]]. PPRD2 deficiency results in aberrant development of the male gametophyte and sporophyte [[cite:PUB00089997]]. Homologues are known from animals, plants and fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14624" "DFG10 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyprenal reductase", "short" "Dfg10/SRD5A3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2086, "taxa" 7295, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3845, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3845, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2572}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
