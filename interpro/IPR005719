DHODs can be divided into two mains classes: class 1 cytosolic enzymes found primarily in Gram-positive bacteria, and class 2 membrane-associated enzymes found primarily in eukaryotic mitochondria and Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00033267]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The class 1 DHODs can be further divided into subclasses 1A and 1B, which differ in their structural organisation and use of electron acceptors. The 1A enzyme is a homodimer of two PyrD subunits where each subunit forms a TIM barrel fold with a bound FMN cofactor located near the top of the barrel [[cite:PUB00005052]]. Fumarate is the natural electron acceptor for this enzyme. The 1B enzyme, in contrast is a heterotetramer composed of a central, FMN-containing, PyrD homodimer resembling the 1A homodimer, and two additional PyrK subunits which contain FAD and a 2Fe-2S cluster [[cite:PUB00024613]]. These additional groups allow the enzyme to use NAD(+) as its natural electron acceptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The class 2 membrane-associated enzymes are monomers which have the FMN-containing TIM barrel domain found in the class 1 PyrD subunit, and an additional N-terminal Î± helical domain [[cite:PUB00024104], [cite:PUB00033268]].
