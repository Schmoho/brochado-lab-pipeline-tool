{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the translocase of chloroplast 159 family of proteins (Tocs), GTPases involved in protein precursor import into chloroplasts, which recognise chloroplast-destined precursor proteins and regulate their presentation to the translocation channel through GTP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00095611]]. They have three domains: the N-terminal A-domain is acidic, repetitive, weakly conserved, readily removed by proteolysis during chloroplast isolation, not required for protein translocation [[cite:PUB00007881], [cite:PUB00095611]], and the other domains are designated G (GTPase) and M (membrane anchor) [[cite:PUB00007881]]. The signature for this family includes most of the G domain and all of M. There are at least two distinct Toc159 subtypes, Toc159 and Toc132/Toc120. Toc159 is expressed in young photosynthetic tissues and seems to be specialised in the import of nuclear encoded photosynthetic preproteins from the cytoplasm to the chloroplast, whereas Toc132/Toc120 are expressed relatively prominent in nonphotosynthetic tissues and seem to be specialised in the import of nuclear encoded non-photosynthetic preproteins from the cytoplasm to the chloroplast [[cite:PUB00095611]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00993" "chloroplast protein import component Toc86/159, G and M domains"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translocase of chloroplast Toc86/159", "short" "Toc86_159"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 935, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1758, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1754, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 692}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
