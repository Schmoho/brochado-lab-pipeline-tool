{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are designated YegS, an apparent lipid kinase family in the Proteobacteria. The crystal structure of YegS has been reported and been shown to be a lipid kinase with phosphatidylglycerol kinase activity. The crystal structure reveals a two-domain protein with significant structural similarity to a family of NAD kinases. The active site is located in the interdomain cleft formed by four conserved sequence motifs. Surprisingly, the structure reveals a novel metal binding site composed of residues conserved in most lipid kinases [[cite:PUB00039707]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bon", "name" "Structure of an Escherichia coli lipid kinase (YegS)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016064", "name" "NAD kinase/diacylglycerol kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03702" "lipid kinase YegS"}, "hamap" {"MF_01377" "Probable lipid kinase YegS [yegS]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid kinase YegS", "short" "Lip_kinase_YegS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 234, "taxa" 2215, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2637, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2637, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1997}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
