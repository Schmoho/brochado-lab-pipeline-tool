{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents absorption protein P2 (synonym: receptor-binding protein P2) from the bacteriophage PRD1. Absorption protein P2 is a multi-β-sheet protein whose complicated topology forms an elongated seahorse-shaped molecule with a distinct head, containing a pseudo-beta propeller structure with approximate six-fold symmetry, and tail (β-sandwich). It is required for the attachment of the phage to the host conjugative DNA transfer complex. This is a poorly understood large transmembrane complex of unknown architecture, with at least 11 different proteins [[cite:PUB00029009]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036325", "name" "Bacteriophage PRD1, P2, absorption protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015948", "name" "Bacteriophage PRD1, P2, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015949", "name" "Bacteriophage PRD1, P2, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09214" "Bacteriophage Prd1, adsorption protein P2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage PRD1, P2, absorption protein", "short" "Phage_PRD1_P2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 29, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015297", :literature {"PUB00029009" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Xu L" "Benson SD" "Butcher SJ" "Bamford DH" "Burnett RM."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(03)00023-6", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The receptor binding protein P2 of PRD1, a virus targeting antibiotic-resistant bacteria, has a novel fold suggesting multiple functions.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "309-22", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12623018}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015297", "name" "Bacteriophage PRD1, P2, absorption protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 3}}}
