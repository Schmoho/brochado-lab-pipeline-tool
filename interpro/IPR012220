{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents the eukaryotic type of glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT, [ec:1.4.1.14]). This pyridine-linked form is found in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes. It displays a single-subunit structure corresponding to the fusion of the small and the large bacterial subunits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glutamate synthase (GOGAT, GltS) is a complex iron-sulphur flavoprotein that catalyses the reductive synthesis of L-glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate and L-glutamine via intramolecular channelling of ammonia, a reaction in the bacterial, yeast and plant pathways for ammonia assimilation [[cite:PUB00013982]]. GOGAT is a multifunctional enzyme that functions through three distinct active centres carrying out multiple reaction steps: L-glutamine hydrolysis, conversion of 2-oxoglutarate into L-glutamate, and electron uptake from an electron donor [[cite:PUB00008698]]. The small subunit functions as a FAD-dependent NADPH oxidoreductase, which serves to transfer reducing equivalents to the site of glutamate synthesis on the large subunit through the enzyme [3Fe-4S] cluster (on the large subunit) and at least one of its [4Fe-4S] centres [[cite:PUB00009386], [cite:PUB00015747]]. The large subunit contains the GltS L-glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) site where L-Gln binds and is hydrolysed to yield L-Glu and ammonia. The latter is transferred through the intramolecular ammonia tunnel [[cite:PUB00013982]] to the glutamate synthase site where 2-OG binds, is converted to the iminoglutarate (2-IG) intermediate, and reduced to L-Glu by receiving reducing equivalents from the reduced FMN cofactor at this site [[cite:PUB00015837]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>There are four classes of GOGAT [[cite:PUB00009386], [cite:PUB00015710]]:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.
