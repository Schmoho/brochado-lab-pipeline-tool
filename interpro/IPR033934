SAICAR synthetase catalyzes the seventh step of the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides (also reported as eighth step). It converts 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyribonucleotide (CAIR), ATP, and L-aspartate into 5-aminoimidazole-4-(N-succinylcarboxamide) ribonucleotide (SAICAR), ADP, and phosphate [[cite:PUB00070198]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3nua", "name" "Crystal Structure of Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-Succinocarboxamide Synthase from Clostridium perfringens"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01415" "bacterial and archaeal 5-aminoimidazole-4-(N-succinylcarboxamide) ribonucleotide (SAICAR) synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterial and archaeal 5-aminoimidazole-4-(N-succinylcarboxamide) ribonucleotide synthase", "short" "SAICAR_synt_PurC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3695, "taxa" 16056, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15446, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15446, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12001}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
