{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Homoaconitase (cis-homoaconitase; [ec:4.2.1.36]) catalyses the dehydration of cis-homoaconitate to homoisocitric acid. It is an enzyme from the alpha-aminoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis, and has been identified in higher fungi and several archaea and one thermophilic species of bacteria, Thermus thermophilus [[cite:PUB00036023]]. Like aconitase, this enzyme binds a [4Fe-4S]-cluster, and it has a similar domain architecture to aconitase and isopropylmalate isomerase family proteins, although it catalyses a different reaction [[cite:PUB00036024]]. Homoaconitase is found in the mitochondria of certain fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036008", "name" "Aconitase, iron-sulfur domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00139" "homoaconitase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homoaconitase, mitochondrial", "short" "Homoaconitase_mito"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1162, "taxa" 3293, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1969, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1969, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1256}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
