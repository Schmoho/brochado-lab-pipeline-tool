{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Ion-translocating oxidoreductase complex subunit C (RnfC, [swissprot:Q8TSY4]) from Methanosarcina acetivorans and related proteins foind in Methanosarcinaceae species. RnfC is part of a membrane-bound complex that couples electron transfer with translocation of ions across the membrane. RnfC catalyses sodium transport, most probably coupled to electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to methanophenazine and heterodisulfide reductase. It is involved in heterodisulfide reduction during methanogenesis from acetate [[cite:PUB00152961]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037225", "name" "NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 51kDa subunit, FMN-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041837" "Rnf electron transport complex subunit RnfC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ion-translocating oxidoreductase complex subunit RnfC, Methanosarcinaceae", "short" "Ion_transpt_RnfC_Methano"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 80, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 53, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 48}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
