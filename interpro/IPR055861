{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of uncharacterized proteins found in bacteriophages. The function of this protein family is currently unknown.  The family appears to be conserved across various phage species that infect Escherichia coli and related bacteria. The family includes members from Phage T2 and T6.Members of this family are typically short proteins of around 60-67 amino acids in length. The structure of these proteins is predicted to be composed of two alpha helices that pack together. Structure prediction suggests these proteins may homodimerise (iPTM=0.83).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24219" "Family of unknown function (DUF7438)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7438", "short" "DUF7438"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 398, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 385, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055861", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055861", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7438", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 18}}}
