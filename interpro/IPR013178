{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Histone acetylation is required in many cellular processes including transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin assembly. This family contains the fungal RTT109 protein, which is required for H3K56 acetylation [[cite:PUB00042670]]. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast) loss of RTT109 results in the loss of H3K56 acetylation, both on bulk histone and on chromatin [[cite:PUB00045009]]. RTT109 and H3K56 acetylation appear to correlate with actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of Pol II in yeast [[cite:PUB00045009]]. This family also includes p300/CBP acetyltransferase, which has different catalytic properties and cofactor regulation to RTT109 [[cite:PUB00051225]]. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a transcriptional co-activator that acetylates both histones and non-histone proteins [[cite:PUB00074833], [cite:PUB00074834], [cite:PUB00074835]]. CBP binds specifically to phosphorylated CREB and enhances its transcriptional activity toward cAMP-responsive genes [[cite:PUB00053723], [cite:PUB00053724]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3biy", "name" "Crystal structure of p300 histone acetyltransferase domain in complex with a bisubstrate inhibitor, Lys-CoA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01250" "Histone acetylation protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR13808" "CBP/P300-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF08214" "Histone acetylation protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone acetyltransferase Rtt109/CBP", "short" "Histone_AcTrfase_Rtt109/CBP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 110, "domain_architectures" 307, "proteomes" 2517, "taxa" 9823, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15706, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12253, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4204}, "pathways" 345}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
