{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glia maturation factor beta and gamma (GMFB/GMFG), Aim7 from budding yeasts and Gmf1 from fission yeasts. GMF family proteins do not interact with actin, but instead bind to Arp2/3 complex. They sever actin-Arp2/3 complex branch junctions by a cofilin-like mechanism [[cite:PUB00071598], [cite:PUB00071599], [cite:PUB00101791]].</p>\n\n<p>Human GMFB was initially identified as a growth and differentiation factor acting on neurons as well as glia in the vertebrate brain. GMFB is produced predominantly in the thymus, and may have roles in both intracellular signal transduction and T cell development [[cite:PUB00014553]].</p>\n\n<p>Fission yeast Gmf1 is an actin depolymerising factor involved in the control of the disassembly of actin patches [[cite:PUB00071594]]. Aim7 binds Arp2/3 complex to stimulate filament debranching and inhibit actin nucleation [[cite:PUB00071594]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3l50", "name" "The crystal structure of human Glia Maturation Factor, Gamma (GMFG)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029006", "name" "ADF-H/Gelsolin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11283" "ADF-homology domain of glia maturation factor beta and related proteins"}, "panther" {"PTHR11249" "GLIAL FACTOR NATURATION FACTOR"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001788" "Glia maturation factor beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glia maturation factor", "short" "GMF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1765, "taxa" 6021, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3585, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3568, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2247}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011171", :literature {"PUB00014553" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Utsuyama M" "Shiraishi J" "Takahashi H" "Kasai M" "Hirokawa K."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
