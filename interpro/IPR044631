{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ethylene biosynthesis is directed by a family of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthases (ACS) that convert S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the immediate precursor ACC. This entry represents a group of plant BTB domain containing proteins involved in the the ethylene pathway, including ETO1, EOL1 and EOL2 from Arabidopsis. They contain six tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), and a coiled-coil motif at their C-terminal. They act together to negatively regulate ethylene synthesis by directing the degradation of type-2 ACS proteins [[cite:PUB00096575]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44203" "ETO1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ETO1-like", "short" "ETO1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 949, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1949, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1949, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1181}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044631", :literature {"PUB00096575" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Christians MJ" "Gingerich DJ" "Hansen M" "Binder BM" "Kieber JJ" "Vierstra RD."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The BTB ubiquitin ligases ETO1, EOL1 and EOL2 act collectively to regulate ethylene biosynthesis in Arabidopsis by controlling type-2 ACC synthase levels.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "332-45", "volume" "57", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18808454}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010105", "name" "negative regulation of ethylene-activated signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044631", "name" "ETO1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
