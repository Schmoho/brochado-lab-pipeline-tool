{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase, [ec:2.5.1.47]) is the enzyme responsible for the formation of cysteine from O-acetyl-serine and hydrogen sulphide with the concomitant release of acetic acid.

CysK differs from CysM in that it can also use sulphide instead of thiosulphate, to produce cysteine instead of cysteine thiosulphonate.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents CysK-type cysteine synthases.
