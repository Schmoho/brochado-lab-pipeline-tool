{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Mad2 and Mad2-like proteins, including Mad2/Rev7 from yeasts and MAD2A/B from animals. Mad2 is a central component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is a feedback control that prevents cells with incompletely assembled spindles from leaving mitosis [[cite:PUB00062897], [cite:PUB00062898]]. Rev7 (also known as MAD2L2 or MAD2B) is an accessory subunit of DNA polymerase zeta [[cite:PUB00073198]]. It also acts as an interaction module in a broad array of cellular pathways, including translesion DNA synthesis, cell cycle control, and non-homologous end joining [[cite:PUB00098022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ekj", "name" "Crystal structure of mammalian Rev7 in complex with human Chromosome alignment-maintaining phosphoprotein 1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036570", "name" "HORMA domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11842" "MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT PROTEIN MAD2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mad2-like", "short" "Mad2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 47, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2586, "taxa" 8786, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7631, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7631, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5020}, "pathways" 60}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045091", :literature {"PUB00062897" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6450", "authors" ["Li R" "Havel C" "Watson JA" "Murray AW."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/366082a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "The mitotic feedback control gene MAD2 encodes the alpha-subunit of a prenyltransferase.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "82-4", "volume" "366", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8232541}, "PUB00062898" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Poddar A" "Stukenberg PT" "Burke DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Eukaryotic Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.4.5.867-878.2005", "medline_journal" "Eukaryot Cell", "title" "Two complexes of spindle checkpoint proteins containing Cdc20 and Mad2 assemble during mitosis independently of the kinetochore in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "867-78", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15879521}, "PUB00098022" {"URL" nil, "issue" "43", "authors" ["Wang X" "Pernicone N" "Pertz L" "Hua D" "Zhang T" "Listovsky T" "Xie W."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "REV7 has a dynamic adaptor region to accommodate small GTPase RAN/<i>Shigella</i> IpaB ligands, and its activity is regulated by the RanGTP/GDP switch.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "15733-15742", "volume" "294", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31484720}, "PUB00073198" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zhang H" "Chatterjee A" "Singh KK."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.105.051029", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Saccharomyces cerevisiae polymerase zeta functions in mitochondria.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "2683-8", "volume" "172", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16452144}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045091", "name" "Mad2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
