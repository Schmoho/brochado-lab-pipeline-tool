{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CD4 is a glycoprotein found on the surface of T cells. It is a co-receptor that assists the T cell receptor (TCR) in communicating with an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The structure of a soluble fragment of CD4 has been determined to 2.3 A and reveals that the molecule has two intimately-associated immunoglobulin-like domains connected by a continuous β strand. Residues implicated in HIV recognition reside in domain D1. Domain D2 is distinguished by a variation in the β-strand topologies of antibody domains that results in a truncated β-barrel with a non-standard intra-sheet disulphide bond [[cite:PUB00004084], [cite:PUB00004083]]. The binding sites for monoclonal antibodies, class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, and HIV gp120 can be mapped on the molecular surface. Ligation of CD4 by MHC-II on blood monocytes mediates macrophage differentiation and it also increases the susceptibility of blood-derived monocytes to HIV binding and subsequent infection [[cite:PUB00095338]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00692" "CD4TCANTIGEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T-cell surface antigen CD4", "short" "CD4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 477, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2113, "sets" 0, "proteins" 361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 247}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000973", :literature {"PUB00004084" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6300", "authors" ["Ryu SE" "Kwong PD" "Truneh A" "Porter TG" "Arthos J" "Rosenberg M" "Dai XP" "Xuong NH" "Axel R" "Sweet RW."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/348419a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Crystal structure of an HIV-binding recombinant fragment of human CD4.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "419-26", "volume" "348", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2247146}, "PUB00004083" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6300", "authors" ["Wang JH" "Yan YW" "Garrett TP" "Liu JH" "Rodgers DW" "Garlick RL" "Tarr GE" "Husain Y" "Reinherz EL" "Harrison SC."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/348411a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Atomic structure of a fragment of human CD4 containing two immunoglobulin-like domains.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "411-8", "volume" "348", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1701030}, "PUB00095338" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Zhen A" "Krutzik SR" "Levin BR" "Kasparian S" "Zack JA" "Kitchen SG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
