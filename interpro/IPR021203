{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Muellerian-inhibiting factor, a member of the transforming growth factor beta family, is a glycoprotein hormone that is structurally related to inhibin and activin. It is expressed in male embryos, preventing formation of the Muellerian ducts [[cite:PUB00053476]]. Expression levels in males remain high in early years, but decline around the time of puberty. In females the protein is not detectable until the onset of puberty, where it is expressed in the ovaries and is involved in folliculogenesis [[cite:PUB00053477], [cite:PUB00053478]]. It is also able to inhibit the growth of tumours derived from tissues of Muellerian duct origin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15009" "MUELLERIAN-INHIBITING FACTOR"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037270" "Muellerian-inhibiting factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Muellerian-inhibiting factor", "short" "Muellerian-inhibiting_factor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 560, "taxa" 2121, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1042, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1034, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 757}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021203", :literature {"PUB00053476" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Behringer RR."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
