{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily comprises more than 20 type-I transmembrane proteins. Family members are defined based on similarity in their extracellular domain - a region that contains many cysteine residues arranged in a specific repetitive pattern [[cite:PUB00046030]]. The cysteines allow formation of an extended rod-like structure, responsible for ligand binding [[cite:PUB00000892]].</p>\n\n<p>Upon receptor activation, different intracellular signalling complexes are assembled for different members of the TNFR superfamily, depending on their intracellular domains and sequences [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Activation of TNFRs can therefore induce a range of disparate effects, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, or apoptotic cell death, depending upon the receptor involved [[cite:PUB00046032]].</p>\n\n<p>TNFRs are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial biological processes, such as lymphoid and neuronal development, innate and adaptive immunity, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Drugs that manipulate their signalling have potential roles in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, such as viral infections, coronary heart disease, transplant rejection, and immune disease [[cite:PUB00046034]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>TNF receptor 12, also known as TWEAK receptor (TWEAKR), fibroblast growth factor-inducible-14 (Fn14) or CD266, is expressed on a wide variety of different cell types and binds the ligand TWEAK (tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis) to activate several signaling cascades through activation of NF-kappaB signaling mediated by adaptor TRAF proteins [[cite:PUB00082434]]. The FN14/TWEAK pathway controls a range of cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and has diverse biological functions in pathological mechanisms like inflammation and fibrosis that are associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [[cite:PUB00082433]].</p>\n\n<p>The Fn14 receptor is the smallest TNFR superfamily member described so far.
