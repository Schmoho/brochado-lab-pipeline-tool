{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains methyltransferases from bacteria and fungi, including VrtF, AdaD, CtvB and VerB. The gene encoding O-methyltransferase VrtF is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of viridicatumtoxin, a tetracycline-like fungal polyketide [[cite:PUB00080716]]. Similarly, the ctvB gene is part of a cluster that encode proteins for the biosynthesis of citreoviridin, an inhibitor of the F1-ATPase beta-subunit. CtvB methylates the alpha-pyrone hydroxyl group of an intermediate to generate citreomontanin [[cite:PUB00082626]]. Methyltransferase VerB is encoded by of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of the neurotoxin verrucosidin, a methylated alpha-pyrone polyketide that inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and thereby causes neurological diseases [[cite:PUB00100792]]. The adaD gene is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of the linear tetracyclic TAN-1612 neuropeptide Y receptor antagonist. AdaD is O-methyltransferase involved in Secondary metabolite biosynthesis  [[cite:PUB00092452]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF011491" "Predicted S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferase, YbcY type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyltransferase VrtF-like", "short" "MeTrfase_VrtF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 322, "taxa" 1907, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1564, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1560, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1256}, "pathways" 147}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
