Immediately after attachment of GPI to newly synthesized proteins, inositol-linked palmitate is removed by deacylase PGAP1 in the ER. The inositol-deacylation is essential for subsequent steps in fatty acid remodeling in the Golgi. PGAP3 removes an unsaturated fatty chain at sn-2 and PGAP2 reacylation of sn-2 with stearic acid follows [[cite:PUB00089778]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12892" "FGF RECEPTOR ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Post-GPI attachment to proteins factor 2", "short" "PGAP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1117, "taxa" 4339, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3444, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3444, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2241}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039545", :literature {"PUB00089778" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Maeda Y" "Tashima Y" "Houjou T" "Fujita M" "Yoko-o T" "Jigami Y" "Taguchi R" "Kinoshita T."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
