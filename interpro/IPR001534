{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transthyretin-related proteins form a nematode-specific expanded protein family that comprises 59 members, 54 of which are predicted to be secreted. The proteins show weak similarity to transthyretin (formerly called prealbumin) which transports thyroid hormones. [[cite:PUB00001984]]. Some transthyretin-related genes are induced in response to environmental challenges such as oxidative stress or pathogen exposure. These proteins possess 4 cysteine residues that are conserved within the C. elegans transthyretin-related protein family, which could serve as reactive oxygen sensors or scavengers [[cite:PUB00093975]].</p>\n<p>Transthyretin-related protein 52 (TTR-52), a member of this family, is required for efficient cell corpse engulfment by the recognition the surface exposed phosphatidylserine (PS). TTR-52 mediates recognition of apoptotic cells by cross-linking the PS signal with the phagocyte receptor CED-1 [[cite:PUB00088242]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038479", "name" "Transthyretin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01060" "Transthyretin-like family"}, "panther" {"PTHR21700" "TRANSTHYRETIN-LIKE FAMILY PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transthyretin-like", "short" "Transthyretin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 136, "proteomes" 91, "taxa" 415, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5540, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3260}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001534", :literature {"PUB00001984" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sonnhammer EL" "Durbin R."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.1997.4989", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Analysis of protein domain families in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "200-16", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9417907}, "PUB00088242" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wang X" "Li W" "Zhao D" "Liu B" "Shi Y" "Chen B" "Yang H" "Guo P" "Geng X" "Shang Z" "Peden E" "Kage-Nakadai E" "Mitani S" "Xue D."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
