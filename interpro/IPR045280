{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant GATA transcription factors, including GATA24/25/28 from Arabidopsis. They contain the GATA-type zinc-finger domain with a longer spacer between its two sets of conserved cysteine residues (C-X2-C-X20-C-X2-C) [[cite:PUB00043676]]. This family is known as the ZIM or the TIFY family. Proteins in this family are plant-specific transcription factors that play crucial roles in cross talk between Jasmonic Acid and other phytohormones like gibberellins, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, auxin, and ethylene signaling pathways [[cite:PUB00098465], [cite:PUB00098466], [cite:PUB00098467]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46125" "GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 28"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GATA transcription factor TIFY-like", "short" "TIFY-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 261, "taxa" 1116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2820, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2820, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1785}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045280", :literature {"PUB00098467" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sun P" "Shi Y" "Valerio AGO" "Borrego EJ" "Luo Q" "Qin J" "Liu K" "Yan Y."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "An updated census of the maize TIFY family.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e0247271", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33621269}, "PUB00098465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Singh P" "Mukhopadhyay K."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Comprehensive molecular dissection of TIFY Transcription factors reveal their dynamic responses to biotic and abiotic stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "9739", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33958607}, "PUB00098466" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Heidari P" "Faraji S" "Ahmadizadeh M" "Ahmar S" "Mora-Poblete F."], "ISO_journal" "Front Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Genet", "title" "New Insights Into Structure and Function of <i>TIFY</i> Genes in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>: A Genome-Wide Comprehensive Analysis.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "657970", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34054921}, "PUB00043676" {"URL" nil, "issue" "397", "authors" ["Shikata M" "Matsuda Y" "Ando K" "Nishii A" "Takemura M" "Yokota A" "Kohchi T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
