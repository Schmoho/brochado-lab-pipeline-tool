{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins that include Lysoplasmalogenase from humans (also known as Transmembrane protein 86B, TMEM86B) and similar proteins found in eukaryotes and bacteria. TMEM86B catalyses the degradation of lysoplasmalogen, which is formed by the hydrolysis of membrane glycerophospholipids plasmalogens. It may modulate cell membrane properties [[cite:PUB00081209]]. Uncharacterized membrane protein YhhN from E. coli also belongs to this group ([swissprot:P0ADI9]). Putative conserved active site residues have been proposed for this family [[cite:PUB00081210]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31885" "GH04784P"}, "pfam" {"PF07947" "YhhN family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysoplasmalogenase-like", "short" "TMEM86B-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 58, "proteomes" 3717, "taxa" 15230, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14297, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14254, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10223}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
