{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of proteins widely distributed across the plant kingdom. Patellin (PATL) proteins are yeast Sec14 protein (Sec14p)-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) involved in several biological processes such as plant development and stress tolerance regulation, playing a role in membrane-trafficking events [[cite:PUB00097178], [cite:PUB00097179]]. In Arabidopsis, this family consists of six members, PATL1-6, and are characterised by the presence of two conserved domains observed in other membrane trafficking-related proteins: a Sec14p-like lipid-binding domain and a GOLD following the N-terminal variable domain. The GOLD domain is found in proteins related to Golgi function, membrane homeostasis and vesicle trafficking [[cite:PUB00097179]]. PATL1 is the defining member of this family, associated to the cell-plate, and has a regulatory role during cytokinesis, which is thought to be involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis that aids cell plate remodeling and completion [[cite:PUB00097179]]. These proteins are able to interact with phosphoinositides, varying their affinity among them which results their involvement in different processes and signalling pathways. PATLs also respond to auxin and play a role in the regulation of PIN1, which suggests that they play a redundant and crucial role in polarity and patterning in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00097179], [cite:PUB00097180]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes some CRAL-TRIO domain-containing proteins from fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45932" "PATELLIN-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Patellin", "short" "PATL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 365, "taxa" 1601, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3814, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3814, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2254}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044834", :literature {"PUB00097180" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Tejos R" "Rodriguez-Furlan C" "Adamowski M" "Sauer M" "Norambuena L" "Friml J."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Sci", "title" "PATELLINS are regulators of auxin-mediated PIN1 relocation and plant development in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28687624}, "PUB00097178" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhou H" "Duan H" "Liu Y" "Sun X" "Zhao J" "Lin H."], "ISO_journal" "J Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Plant Physiol", "title" "Patellin protein family functions in plant development and stress response.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "94-97", "volume" "234-235", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30690193}, "PUB00097179" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Peterman TK" "Ohol YM" "McReynolds LJ" "Luna EJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Patellin1, a novel Sec14-like protein, localizes to the cell plate and binds phosphoinositides.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "3080-94; discussion 3001-2", "volume" "136", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15466235}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008289", "name" "lipid binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044834", "name" "Patellin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
