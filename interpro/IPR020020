{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a distinct subgroup among members of the luciferase monooxygenase domain family. The larger family contains both FMN-binding enzymes (luciferase, alkane monooxygenase) and F420-binding enzymes (methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase, secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Although some members of the domain family bind coenzyme F420 rather than FMN, members of this family are from species that lack the genes for F420 biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03571" "TIGR03571 family LLM class oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Luciferase-type oxidoreductase", "short" "Luciferase-type_oxidoreductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 534, "taxa" 3119, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2774, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2774, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2165}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020020", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020020", "name" "Luciferase-type oxidoreductase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
