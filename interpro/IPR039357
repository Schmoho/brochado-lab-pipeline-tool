{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenases ([ec:1.3.99.5]) catalyse the conversion of 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid + acceptor to 3-oxo-delta(4)-steroid + reduced acceptor. The steroid 5-alpha-reductase enzyme is responsible for the formation of dihydrotestosterone, this hormone promotes the differentiation of male external genitalia and the prostate during foetal development [[cite:PUB00007121]]. In humans mutations in this enzyme can cause a form of male pseudohermaphorditism in which the external genitalia and prostate fail to develop normally. A related steroid reductase enzyme, DET2, is found in plants such as Arabidopsis. Mutations in this enzyme cause defects in light-regulated development [[cite:PUB00007122]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another enzyme in this entry is very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase (TECR; [ec:1.3.1.93]), which catalyzes the last of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle by reducing the trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA fatty acid intermediate to an acyl-CoA that can be further elongated by entering a new cycle of elongation [[cite:PUB00089496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7c83", "name" "Crystal structure of an integral membrane steroid 5-alpha-reductase PbSRD5A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10556" "3-OXO-5-ALPHA-STEROID 4-DEHYDROGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase/very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase", "short" "SRD5A/TECR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2818, "taxa" 10432, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13345, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8728}, "pathways" 74}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
