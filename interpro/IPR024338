{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mid1 is a yeast plasma membrane protein required for Ca2+ influx induced by the mating pheromone alpha-factor during the mating process [[cite:PUB00056158], [cite:PUB00056159], [cite:PUB00056160]]. The protein is composed of 548-amino-acid residues, contains four hydrophobic regions (H1, H2, H3 and H4) and two cysteine-rich regions (C1 and C2) at the C terminus. H1 appears to be a signal sequence necessary for the alpha-factor-induced delivery to the plasma membrane. The region from H1 to H3 is required for the localisation of Mid1 in the plasma and ER membranes. C1 and C2 are thought to be involved in oligomerisation via the formation of disulphide bonds. Trafficking of Mid1-GFP to the plasma membrane is dependent on the N-glycosylation of Mid1 and the transporter protein Sec12. This suggests that the trafficking of Mid1-GFP to the plasma membrane requires a Sec12-dependent pathway from the ER to the Golgi, and that Mid1 is recruited via a Sec6- and Sec7-independent pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Yam8/Ehs1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Ehs1 is required for Ca2+ influx and for vitality of cells in a late, pheromone-induced event of the mating process requiring calcium-induced signalling [[cite:PUB00086861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12929" "Stretch-activated Ca2+-permeable channel component"}, "panther" {"PTHR39142" "MID1P"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stretch-activated cation channel MID1/Yam8", "short" "MID1/Yam8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 41, "proteomes" 1177, "taxa" 3327, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1762, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1735, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1069}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024338", :literature {"PUB00056158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ozeki-Miyawaki C" "Moriya Y" "Tatsumi H" "Iida H" "Sokabe M."], "ISO_journal" "Exp.
