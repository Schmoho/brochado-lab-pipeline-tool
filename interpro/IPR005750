{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The bacterial enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) enolpyruvyltransferase (MurA) catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine, which is the first committed step of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Experimental evidence suggests that binding of substrates to the enzyme does not exclusively follow an ordered mechanism with UDP-GlcNAc binding first, although binding of UDP-GlcNAc to free enzyme is preferred and possibly influenced by pyruvate-P. The reaction thus appears to follow an induced-fit mechanism, in which the binding site for fosfomycin, and presumably also for pyruvate-P, is created by the interaction of free enzyme with the sugar nucleotide [[cite:PUB00030098]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zh4", "name" "crystal structure of S. pneumoniae Hungary 19A MurA1 in complex with citrate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036968", "name" "Enolpyruvate transferase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013792", "name" "RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase/enolpyruvate transferase, alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01555" "UdpNAET"}, "hamap" {"MF_00111" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase [murA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01072" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase", "short" "UDP_GlcNAc_COvinyl_MurA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 57, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8917, "taxa" 35441, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46942, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46942, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35853}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1448", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1448"} {"accession" "GenProp1623", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1623"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
