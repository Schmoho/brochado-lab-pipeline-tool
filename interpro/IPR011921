{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial lipopolysachharides (LPS) are glycolipids that make up the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria. Though LPS moleculesare variable, they all show the same general features: an outer polysaccharide which is attached to the lipid component, termed lipid A [[cite:PUB00033945]]. The polysaccharide component consists of a variable repeat-structure polysaccharide known as the O-antigen, and a highly conserved short core oligosaccharide which connects the O-antigen to lipid A. Lipid A is a glucosamine-based phospholipid that makes up the membrane anchor region of LPS [[cite:PUB00028103]]. The structure of lipid A is relatively invariant between species, presumably reflecting its fundamental role in membrane integrity. Recognition of lipid A by the innate immune system can lead to a response even at picomolar levels. In some genera, such as Neisseria and Haemophilus, lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are the predominant glycolipids [[cite:PUB00033946]]. These are analogous to LPS except that they lack O-antigens, with the LOS oligosaccharide structures limited to 10 saccharide units.</p>\n\n<p>This family consists of Lipid A biosynthesis myristoyltransferase (LpxM, also known as MsbB) in Escherichia coli and closely related proteins in other species. LpxM is homologous to HtrB ([interpro:IPR011920]) and acts immediately after it in the biosynthesis of KDO-2 lipid A (also called Re LPS and Re endotoxin). These two enzymes act after creation of KDO-2 lipid IV-A by addition of the KDO sugars.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02208" "lauroyl-Kdo(2)-lipid IV(A) myristoyltransferase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01944" "Lipid A biosynthesis myristoyltransferase [lpxM]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid A biosynthesis myristoyltransferase", "short" "Lipid_A_MsbB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 290, "taxa" 2001, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2268, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2268, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1717}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0204", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0204"} {"accession" "GenProp1325", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1325"} {"accession" "GenProp1397", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1397"} {"accession" "GenProp1647", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1647"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
