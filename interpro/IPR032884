It catalyses the NAD-dependent oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P) to 6-phosphogluconolactone [[cite:PUB00076982]]. It is a homodimeric enzyme of 32kDa subunits, catalysing the NAD+ specific oxidation of Glc6P. Interestingly, it is not related to the classical Glc6PDH of the OPPP in bacteria and eukarya [[cite:PUB00076982]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041293" "NAD-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Azf"}, "hamap" {"MF_02046" "NAD-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, archaea", "short" "Glc6PDH_archaea"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 560, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 403, "sets" 0, "proteins" 403, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 351}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
