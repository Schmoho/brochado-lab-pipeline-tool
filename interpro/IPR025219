{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A small family of bacterial proteins, found in several species from bacteroidetes. Structure determination (NMR and Xray) shows an immunoglobulin Î²-barrel fold.  Multiple homologues have been found in human gut metagenomics data sets. Structural experimentation shows it to share features with two well-established protein architectures in the SCOP database, ie, C2 (calcium/lipid-binding domain) of the C2 domain  ([interpro:IPR000008])\n and the PLAT/LH2 domain ([interpro:IPR001024]). The C2 and PLAT/LH2 domains bind Ca2+ in their functions of targeting proteins to cell-membranes; this domain is also shown to bind Ca2+ as well as to be a novel fold [[cite:PUB00075637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3u6g", "name" "Crystal structure of a domain of unknown function, DUF4425 (BVU_3708) from Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482 at 1.35 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11379" "Uncharacterized protein conserved in Bacteroidetes"}, "pfam" {"PF14466" "PLAT/LH2 and C2-like Ca2+-binding lipoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PLAT/LH2 and C2-like Ca2+-binding lipoprotein", "short" "PLCC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 149, "sets" 0, "proteins" 149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 114}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025219", :literature {"PUB00075637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Serrano P" "Geralt M" "Mohanty B" "Wuthrich K."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.2284", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Structural representative of the protein family PF14466 has a new fold and establishes links with the C2 and PLAT domains from the widely distant Pfams PF00168 and PF01477.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1000-7", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23681886}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025219", "name" "PLAT/LH2 and C2-like Ca2+-binding lipoprotein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 23}}}
