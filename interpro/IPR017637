{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes across the cytoplasmic membrane.

In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This ABC transporter periplasmic substrate binding protein component is found in a region of the salmonella typhimurium LT2 genome [[cite:PUB00042844]] responsible for the catabolism of 2-aminoethylphosphonate via the phnWX pathway ([genprop:GenProp0238]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4r6y", "name" "Crystal structure of solute-binding protein stm0429 from salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium str. lt2, target efi-510776, a closed conformation, in complex with glycerol and acetate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03227" "2-aminoethylphosphonate ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative 2-aminoethylphosphonate binding protein, ABC transporter", "short" "AminoethylPonate_ABC-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 81, "taxa" 695, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 905, "sets" 0, "proteins" 905, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 746}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0712", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0712"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017637", :literature {"PUB00071938" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Saurin W" "Dassa E."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.5560030216", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Sequence relationships between integral inner membrane proteins of binding protein-dependent transport systems: evolution by recurrent gene duplications.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "325-44", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8003968}, "PUB00042844" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Jiang W" "Metcalf WW" "Lee KS" "Wanner BL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
