{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays a role in cell death/ survival, senescence, and endocrine signalling [[cite:PUB00054115]]. Its substrates are well characterised, but evidence for the identity of its direct regulators has been wanting. Recently, the nuclear protein AROS (also termed 40S ribosomal protein S19-binding protein 1 [[cite:PUB00054116]]) has been implicated in the direct regulation of SIRT1 function - this protein has been dubbed 'active regulator of SIRT1. The protein has been shown to enhance SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53, in vitro and in vivo, and to inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional activity. It is the first direct SIRT1 regulator to have been identified that modulates p53-mediated growth regulation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02029" "Active regulator of SIRT1"}, "pfam" {"PF15684" "Active regulator of SIRT1, or 40S ribosomal protein S19-binding 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR31454" "ACTIVE REGULATOR OF SIRT1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Active regulator of SIRT1", "short" "AROS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 748, "taxa" 3048, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1114, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1039, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 743}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023262", :literature {"PUB00054115" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kim EJ" "Kho JH" "Kang MR" "Um SJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
