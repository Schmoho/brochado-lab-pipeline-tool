{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 2-methylisoborneol synthase (2-MIBS), mainly found in Actinomycetes. This enzyme catalyses the cyclization of 2-methylgeranyl diphosphate (2-MeGPP) to 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) [[cite:PUB00151214]]. 2-MIB is one of the terpenoid compounds that are known as odorous and volatile microbial metabolites. It is produced by a wide variety of Actinomycete soil organisms, myxobacteria, and cyanobacteria. It has an unusually low odor threshold and, together with geosmin, is responsible for the characteristic smell of moist soil as well as unpleasant taste and odor associated with public water supplies and contamination of various foods, including fish, wine, and beer. In Streptomyces coelicolor, this enzyme ([swissprot:Q9F1Y6]) is also able to catalyse the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate (GPP), although with lower efficiency, leading to the formation of a complex mixture of cyclic monoterpenes [[cite:PUB00151216]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4zq8", "name" "Crystal structure of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces lydicus, target EFI-540129"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008949", "name" "Isoprenoid synthase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041167" "family 2 encapsulin nanocompartment cargo protein terpene cyclase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-methylisoborneol synthase", "short" "MIB_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 323, "taxa" 1050, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 972, "sets" 0, "proteins" 972, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 671}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
