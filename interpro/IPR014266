{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family occurs in strictly within a subset of Gram-negative bacterial species with the proposed PEP-CTERM/exosortase system [[cite:PUB00034422]], analogous to the LPXTG/sortase system common in Gram-positive bacteria. The proteins in this entry occur in a species if, and only if, a transmembrane histidine kinase ([interpro:IPR014265]) and a DNA-binding response regulator ([interpro:IPR014264]) also occur. The present of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) suggests they may be involved in protein-protein interaction, possibly for the regulation of PEP-CTERM protein expression, since many PEP-CTERM proteins in these genomes are preceded by a proposed DNA binding site for the response regulator.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011990", "name" "Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02917" "XrtA/PEP-CTERM system TPR-repeat protein PrsT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PEP-CTERM system TPR-repeat protein PrsT", "short" "PEP-CTERM_TPR_PrsT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 387, "taxa" 1499, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2127, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2114, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1562}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0652", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0652"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014266", :literature {"PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
