{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents type 10 adenylate cyclases (also known as soluble adenylyl cyclase; [ec:4.6.1.1]), which produces cAMP and phosphate from ATP. This enzyme has a critical role in mammalian spermatogenesis by producing cAMP to mediate the cAMP-responsive nuclear factors indispensable for maturation of sperm in the epididymis [[cite:PUB00042963]]. This induces capacitation, the maturational process that sperm undergo prior to fertilization. Soluble adenylyl cyclase binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit, and is activated by manganese or magnesium ions. The enzyme is activated by bicarbonate in the presence of magnesium ions, and inhibited by bicarbonate i nthe presence of manganese ions. Genetic variations in the gene that encodes this enzyme (ADCY10) are associated with absorptive hypercalciuria type 2 (HCA2) [OMIM:143870].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF011131" "Soluble adenylyl cyclase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylate cyclase, type 10", "short" "Adenylate_cyclase_typ10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 63, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
