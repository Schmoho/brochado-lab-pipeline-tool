{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the functionally uncharacterised protein Amuc_1100 ([swissprot:B2UR41]) from Akkermansia muciniphila, a probiotic bacterium known to influence glucose homeostasis and to contribute to gut health. The crystal structure of Amuc_1100 was determined ([pdbe:6KNY]) and revealed a structural similarity to three proteins related to pilus formation, PilO, PilN and EpsL, indicating potential similarity in  function [[cite:PUB00105705]]. Amuc_1100 folds into an α/β structure consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel curved β-sheet with α-helices packed on the concave side of the sheet.</p>\n\n<p>Amuc_1100 was shown to interact with Toll-like receptor 2 and to improve the gut barrier via activation of this receptor [[cite:PUB00105704]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038287" "Amuc_1100 family pilus-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amuc_1100 pilus-like", "short" "Amuc_1100-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 95, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 136, "sets" 0, "proteins" 136, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048049", :literature {"PUB00105705" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Mou L" "Peng X" "Chen Y" "Xiao Q" "Liao H" "Liu M" "Guo L" "Liu Y" "Zhang X" "Deng D."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun", "title" "Crystal structure of monomeric Amuc_1100 from Akkermansia muciniphila.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "168-174", "volume" "76", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32254050}, "PUB00105704" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Plovier H" "Everard A" "Druart C" "Depommier C" "Van Hul M" "Geurts L" "Chilloux J" "Ottman N" "Duparc T" "Lichtenstein L" "Myridakis A" "Delzenne NM" "Klievink J" "Bhattacharjee A" "van der Ark KC" "Aalvink S" "Martinez LO" "Dumas ME" "Maiter D" "Loumaye A" "Hermans MP" "Thissen JP" "Belzer C" "de Vos WM" "Cani PD."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Med", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Med", "title" "A purified membrane protein from Akkermansia muciniphila or the pasteurized bacterium improves metabolism in obese and diabetic mice.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "107-113", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27892954}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048049", "name" "Amuc_1100 pilus-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
