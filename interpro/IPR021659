{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NdhS/CRR31 (chlororespiratory reduction 31) is a subunit of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex [[cite:PUB00083363]]. It is also a subunit of the cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex [[cite:PUB00083366], [cite:PUB00083365]]. NAD(P)H-oxidizing subunits have not been found in chloroplasts or cyanobacteria, where ferredoxin is probably the electron donor. NdhS contributes to the formation of a ferredoxin binding site of NDH [[cite:PUB00083363]] and is necessary for high affinity binding of ferredoxin [[cite:PUB00083368]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex, also known as NADPH:plastoquinone oxidoreductase or type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, is involved in plastoquinone reduction and cyclic electron transfer (CET) around photosystem I. The chloroplast NDH is more similar to cyanobacterial NDH-1, which is believed to be the origin of chloroplast NDH, than to mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase present in the same species [[cite:PUB00083364], [cite:PUB00083367]]. The NDH complexes of chloroplasts, however, contain many subunits that are absent from cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3c4s", "name" "Crystal structure of the Ssl0352 protein from Synechocystis sp.
