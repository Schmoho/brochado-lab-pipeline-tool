{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Three finger toxins (3FTx) constitute an important superfamily of snake venom proteins. All have three Î²-stranded loops resembling three fingers, emerging from a globular core and stabilised by four conserved disulfide bridges. They are diverse in their biological functions, and include neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, cytotoxins, fasciculins, platelet-aggregation inhibitors and specific ion-channel blockers [[cite:PUB00074532], [cite:PUB00097874]].</p>\n\n<p>Neurotoxins interfere with cholinergic transmission at postsynaptic sites in the peripheral and central nervous systems and consist of alpha-neurotoxins, kappa-neurotoxins and muscarinic toxins. Cardiotoxins are the second largest group and are only found in cobra venoms [[cite:PUB00074537]]. Acetylcholine receptors are blocked by alpha-neurotoxin [[cite:PUB00097874], [cite:PUB00023016], [cite:PUB00097201]] and cardiotoxins (cytotoxins) [[cite:PUB00074538]]. Some members of this family also inhibit GABAA receptors (GABAARs) with different efficacy [[cite:PUB00097874]]. Fasciculins (cytotoxins) inhibit L-type calcium-channel blockers [[cite:PUB00037712]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tgx", "name" "X-RAY STRUCTURE AT 1.55 A OF TOXIN GAMMA, A CARDIOTOXIN FROM NAJA NIGRICOLLIS VENOM.
