{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a widespread protein family known as MAPEG (Membrane Associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism) [[cite:PUB00005060]]. This group of membrane associated proteins with highly divergent functions, such as the metabolism of eicosanoids [[cite:PUB00044025], [cite:PUB00099806]]. Included are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>5-lipoxygenase activating protein (gene FLAP), which seems to be required for the activation of 5-lipoxygenase.</li>\n<li>Leukotriene C4 synthase ([ec:2.5.1.37]), which catalyses the production of LTC4 from LTA4. The structure of human LTC4S was solved by X-ray crystallography [[cite:PUB00044025]].</li>\n<li>Microsomal glutathione S-transferase II ([ec:2.5.1.18]) (GST-II), which also produces LTC4 from LTA4. These enzymes play an important role in the resistance to temperature stresses and lipid peroxidation [[cite:PUB00099807], [cite:PUB00099804]].</li>\n<li>Prostaglandin E synthase, which catalyses the synthesis of PGE2 from PGH2 (produced by cyclooxygenase from arachidonic acid).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because of structural similarities in the active sites of FLAP, LTC4 synthase and PGE synthase, substrates for each enzyme can compete with one another and modulate synthetic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4yl1", "name" "Crystal Structures of mPGES-1 Inhibitor Complexes"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023352", "name" "Membrane associated eicosanoid/glutathione metabolism-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01124" "MAPEG family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane-associated, eicosanoid/glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) protein", "short" "Membr-assoc_MAPEG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 193, "proteomes" 5112, "taxa" 20080, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35412, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25571}, "pathways" 97}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1603", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1603"} {"accession" "GenProp1653", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1653"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
