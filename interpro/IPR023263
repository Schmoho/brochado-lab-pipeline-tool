{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), also referred to as Arg3.1 (Activity-Regulated Gene), is an immediate-early gene predominantly found in mammals that has been related to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory processes [[cite:PUB00054117], [cite:PUB00054118], [cite:PUB00054119], [cite:PUB00054120], [cite:PUB00098833]]. It has been shown that Arc/Arg3.1 expression increases with strong synaptic activation [[cite:PUB00054119]]. Its mRNA is transported to activated dendritic regions, conferring on the protein-distribution temporal correlation with the inducing stimulus and spatial specificity [[cite:PUB00054119], [cite:PUB00098831]].</p>\n\n<p>Via interactions with dynamin and endophilin isoforms, the Arc/Arg3.1 protein enhances receptor endocytosis [[cite:PUB00054118]]. Specifically, it modulates trafficking of neuronal AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) by accelerating endocytosis and reducing surface expression [[cite:PUB00054118]]. In particular, Arc/Arg3.1 has been shown to reduce the number of GluR2/3 receptors, leading to a decrease in AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents [[cite:PUB00054119]]. These observations are consistent with a role in homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength [[cite:PUB00054119], [cite:PUB00098834]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8qf4", "name" "Complex between N-lobe of Arc and nanobody H11"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15962" "ACTIVITY-REGULATED CYTOSKELETON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN"}, "prints" {"PR02027" "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein", "short" "Arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 510, "taxa" 1698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 608, "sets" 0, "proteins" 603, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 459}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023263", :literature {"PUB00054117" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Shepherd JD" "Rumbaugh G" "Wu J" "Chowdhury S" "Plath N" "Kuhl D" "Huganir RL" "Worley PF."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.08.034", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Arc/Arg3.1 mediates homeostatic synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "475-84", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17088213}, "PUB00054118" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chowdhury S" "Shepherd JD" "Okuno H" "Lyford G" "Petralia RS" "Plath N" "Kuhl D" "Huganir RL" "Worley PF."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.08.033", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Arc/Arg3.1 interacts with the endocytic machinery to regulate AMPA receptor trafficking.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "445-59", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17088211}, "PUB00054119" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rial Verde EM" "Lee-Osbourne J" "Worley PF" "Malinow R" "Cline HT."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.031", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Increased expression of the immediate-early gene arc/arg3.1 reduces AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "461-74", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17088212}, "PUB00054120" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bock J" "Thode C" "Hannemann O" "Braun K" "Darlison MG."], "ISO_journal" "Neuroscience", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.02.048", "medline_journal" "Neuroscience", "title" "Early socio-emotional experience induces expression of the immediate-early gene Arc/arg3.1 (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein/activity-regulated gene) in learning-relevant brain regions of the newborn chick.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "625-33", "volume" "133", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15908132}, "PUB00098831" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Greer PL" "Hanayama R" "Bloodgood BL" "Mardinly AR" "Lipton DM" "Flavell SW" "Kim TK" "Griffith EC" "Waldon Z" "Maehr R" "Ploegh HL" "Chowdhury S" "Worley PF" "Steen J" "Greenberg ME."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "704-16", "volume" "140", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20211139}, "PUB00098833" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang W" "Chuang YA" "Na Y" "Ye Z" "Yang L" "Lin R" "Zhou J" "Wu J" "Qiu J" "Savonenko A" "Leahy DJ" "Huganir R" "Linden DJ" "Worley PF."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Arc Oligomerization Is Regulated by CaMKII Phosphorylation of the GAG Domain: An Essential Mechanism for Plasticity and Memory Formation.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "13-25.e5", "volume" "75", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31151856}, "PUB00098834" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Epstein I" "Finkbeiner S."], "ISO_journal" "Semin Cell Dev Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Semin Cell Dev Biol", "title" "The Arc of cognition: Signaling cascades regulating Arc and implications for cognitive function and disease.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "63-72", "volume" "77", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29559111}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003729", "name" "mRNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0050804", "name" "modulation of chemical synaptic transmission", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:2000969", "name" "positive regulation of AMPA receptor activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023263", "name" "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
