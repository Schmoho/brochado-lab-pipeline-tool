{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The RnfH family is a member of the ubiquitin superfamily. Members of the RnfH family strongly co-occur in two distinct gene neighbourhood contexts. In one it is associated with a START domain protein, a membrane protein SmpA and the transfer mRNA binding protein SmpB. This association suggests a possible role in the SmpB-tmRNA-based tagging and degradation system of bacteria, which is interesting given that other members of the ubiquitin system are analogously involved in protein-tagging and degradation across eukaryotes and various prokaryotes. The second context in which the RnfH genes are present is in a membrane associated complex involved in transporting electrons for various reductive reactions such as nitrogen fixation [[cite:PUB00034476]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016155", "name" "Molybdopterin synthase/thiamin biosynthesis sulphur carrier, beta-grasp", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037021", "name" "RnfH superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37483" "UPF0125 PROTEIN RATB"}, "hamap" {"MF_00460" "Protein RnfH [rnfH]"}, "pfam" {"PF03658" "RnfH family Ubiquitin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RnfH protein", "short" "RnfH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 1759, "taxa" 8034, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9051, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9051, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7004}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005346", :literature {"PUB00034476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-7-r60", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The prokaryotic antecedents of the ubiquitin-signaling system and the early evolution of ubiquitin-like beta-grasp domains.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "R60", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16859499}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005346", "name" "RnfH protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 130, "alignment:full" 1861}}}
