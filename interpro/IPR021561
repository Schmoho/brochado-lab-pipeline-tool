{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AbiEi is the cognate antitoxin of the type IV toxin-antitoxin 'innate immunity' bacterial abortive infection (Abi) system that protects bacteria from the spread of a phage infection. The Abi system is activated upon infection with phage to abort the cell thus preventing the spread of phage through viral replication. There are some 20 or more Abis, and they are predominantly plasmid-encoded lactococcal systems. TA, toxin-antitoxin, systems on plasmids function by killing cells that lose the plasmid upon division. AbiE phage resistance systems function as novel Type IV TAs and are widespread in bacteria and archaea [[cite:PUB00075538]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11459" "Transcriptional regulator, AbiEi antitoxin, Type IV TA system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulator, AbiEi 3 antitoxin, Type IV TA system", "short" "AbiEi_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 519, "taxa" 3332, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2541, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2541, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2024}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021561", :literature {"PUB00075538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Dy RL" "Przybilski R" "Semeijn K" "Salmond GP" "Fineran PC."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1419", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "A widespread bacteriophage abortive infection system functions through a Type IV toxin-antitoxin mechanism.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "4590-605", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24465005}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021561", "name" "Transcriptional regulator, AbiEi 3 antitoxin, Type IV TA system", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 14, "alignment:full" 562}}}
