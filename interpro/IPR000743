In fruit, polygalacturonase plays an important role in cell wall metabolism during ripening. In plant bacterial pathogens such as Erwinia carotovora or Ralstonia solanacearum (Pseudomonas solanacearum) and fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus niger, polygalacturonase is involved in maceration and soft-rotting of plant tissue. Exo-poly-alpha-D-galacturonosidase ([ec:3.2.1.82]) (exoPG) [[cite:PUB00002118]] hydrolyses peptic acid from the non-reducing end, releasing digalacturonate.
