{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes across the cytoplasmic membrane. Most of the bacterial ABC (ATP-binding cassette) importers are composed of one or two transmembrane permease proteins, one or two nucleotide-binding proteins and a highly specific periplasmic solute-binding protein. In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the basis of sequence similarities, the vast majority of these solute-binding proteins can be grouped [[cite:PUB00003610]] into eight families or clusters, which generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dpe", "name" "DIPEPTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30290" "PERIPLASMIC BINDING COMPONENT OF ABC TRANSPORTER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Solute-binding protein family 5", "short" "SBP_5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 250, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8516, "taxa" 35399, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 264983, "sets" 0, "proteins" 264983, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 199818}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039424", :literature {"PUB00071938" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Saurin W" "Dassa E."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.5560030216", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Sequence relationships between integral inner membrane proteins of binding protein-dependent transport systems: evolution by recurrent gene duplications.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "325-44", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8003968}, "PUB00003610" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Tam R" "Saier MH Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
