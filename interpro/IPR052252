{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is involved in the metabolism of hyaluronic acid (HA), a major component of the extracellular matrix. It includes Cell migration-inducing and hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP) and Cell surface hyaluronidase (CEMIP2) which mediate the depolymerization of high-molecular-weight HA into intermediate-sized fragments [[cite:PUB00154997], [cite:PUB00154996]]. This process is crucial for various physiological functions, including the regulation of angiogenesis, heart development, and cell migration [[cite:PUB00154998], [cite:PUB00154999]]. CEMIP is known to bind HA and is implicated in the catabolism of HA in tissues such as the dermis and synovium. It may also play roles in pathological conditions by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression [[cite:PUB00154995], [cite:PUB00089707]]. Additionally, these proteins can regulate cell adhesion and migration by modulating HA degradation at focal adhesion sites [[cite:PUB00154998], [cite:PUB00154999]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15535" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell surface hyaluronidase CEMIP/CEMIP2", "short" "CEMIP/CEMIP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 696, "taxa" 2584, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3468, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3468, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 711}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
