{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The elongator complex is a major component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) holoenzyme responsible for transcriptional elongation. It binds to both naked and nucleosomal DNA, can acetylate both core and nucleosomal histones, and is involved in chromatin remodelling [[cite:PUB00007910]]. It acetylates histones H3, preferentially at 'Lys-14', and H4, preferentially at 'Lys-8'. ELP3 is required for the complex integrity and for the association of the complex with nascent RNA transcript. ELP3 is thought to act as a highly conserved histone acetyltransferase (HAT) capable of acetylating core histones in vitro, however, it is clearly a multi-domain protein. The HAT activity is thought to be present only in the C-terminal GNAT domain (histone acyltransferase domain). Recent work [[cite:PUB00084177]] suggests that both the histone acetyltransferase and radical S-adenosylmethionine domains are essential for function, although the exact role of the Radical SAM domain is still unclear. The radical SAM domain is important for the structural integrity of the protein complex, and in yeast (previously demonstrated) [[cite:PUB00084177]]. However, an alternative may be that ELP3 binds and cleave SAM, as seen in the archaean <i>M. jannaschii</i>. It has also been shown in previous studies that the mouse ELP3 does not require the histone acyltransferase domain for zygotic paternal genome demethylation [[cite:PUB00084176], [cite:PUB00084178], [cite:PUB00084179], [cite:PUB00084181]].</p>\n\n<p>The archaeal protein which is the homologue of the third subunit of the eukaryotic elongator complex (Elp3), catalyses the tRNA wobble uridine modification at C5: the same reaction as the eukaryotic elongator complex. The proposed mechanism of action by Elp3 represents an unprecedented chemistry performed on acetyl-CoA in which the methyl group of the acetly-CoA is activated by the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. This then adds to the uridine of tRNA [[cite:PUB00084180]].</p>\n\n<p>Some bacterial ELP3 homologues are known as tRNA uridine(34) acetyltransferase [[cite:PUB00084181]].</p>\n\n<p>\"</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6iaz", "name" "The archaeal Methanocaldococcus infernus Elp3 with N-terminus deletion (1-46)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00344" "ELP3-like"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005669" "Predicted histone acetyltransferase with radical SAM domain, Elp3 type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01211" "tRNA uridine(34) 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl modification radical SAM/GNAT enzyme Elp3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Elongator complex protein 3-like", "short" "ELP3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2742, "taxa" 11307, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8348, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8190, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5900}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
