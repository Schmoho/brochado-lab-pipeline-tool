{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Slingshot (SSH) is a cofilin-specific phosphatase. Dephosphorylation reactivates cofilin, which in turn depolymerizes actin and is thus required for actin filament reorganization [[cite:PUB00063284]]. Slingshot is a member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase family [[cite:PUB00056893]]. The N-terminal SSH region may be involved in P-cofilin binding (the model C terminus plus the DEK_C-like domain, which are characterized as the \"B\" domain in some of the literature), and may be required for the F-actin mediated activation of slingshot [[cite:PUB00094267], [cite:PUB00094268]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45864" "SLINGSHOT PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase Slingshot-like", "short" "Phosphatase_SSH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 994, "taxa" 4014, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5240, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2739}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
