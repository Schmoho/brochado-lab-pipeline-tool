{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Pox virus Ag35 surface protein is an evelope protein known as protein H5 or Late transcription elongation factor OPG110. It is involved in the co-transcriptional or post-transcriptional endoribonucleolytic cleavage that generates sequence-homogeneous 3' ends during late transcription and in postreplicative transcription elongation on intermediate and late genes. It plays a role in DNA replication and in multiple steps of virion morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00103564]] and is required both for inclusion of virosoplasm into crescents as well as for maturation of immature virions (IV) into mature virions (MV) [[cite:PUB00103563]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03286" "Pox virus Ag35 surface protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pox virus Ag35 surface protein", "short" "Pox_Ag35"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 30, "taxa" 149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 174, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004966", :literature {"PUB00103563" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["D'Costa SM" "Bainbridge TW" "Kato SE" "Prins C" "Kelley K" "Condit RC."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Vaccinia H5 is a multifunctional protein involved in viral DNA replication, postreplicative gene transcription, and virion morphogenesis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "49-60", "volume" "401", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20206959}, "PUB00103564" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Boyle KA" "Greseth MD" "Traktman P."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Genetic Confirmation that the H5 Protein Is Required for Vaccinia Virus DNA Replication.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "6312-27", "volume" "89", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25855734}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019031", "name" "viral envelope", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004966", "name" "Pox virus Ag35 surface protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 34}}}
