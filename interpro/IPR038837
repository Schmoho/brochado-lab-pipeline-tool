{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>tRNA ligase 1 (RNL) is involved in the pre-tRNA splicing process in plants. Pre-tRNA splicing requires intron removal by an endonuclease, and a ligase for joining the resulting tRNA halves. In Arabidopsis, the endonuclease is encoded by two genes, SEN1 and SEN2 [[cite:PUB00088477]], and tRNA ligase is encoded by one gene, AtRNL [[cite:PUB00088472]]. Like fungal tRNA ligases, a plant tRNA ligase is a multifunctional enzyme consisting of three domains each with a different activity in the order: ligase, kinase and cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase). The polynucleotide kinase domain heals the broken ends to generate the 3'-OH, 2'-PO4, and 5'-PO4 required for sealing by the ligase domain [[cite:PUB00088473]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35460" "TRNA LIGASE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA ligase 1", "short" "tRNA_ligase_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 278, "taxa" 1150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1095, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 676}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
