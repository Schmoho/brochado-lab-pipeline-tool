{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SKIP (SKI-interacting protein) is an essential spliceosomal component and transcriptional coregulator, which may provide regulatory coupling of transcription initiation and splicing [[cite:PUB00043556]]. SKIP was identified in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, where it was shown to interact with both the cellular and viral forms of SKI through the highly conserved region on SKIP known as the SNW domain [[cite:PUB00043557]]. SKIP is now known to interact with a number of other proteins as well. SKIP potentiates the activity of important transcription factors, such as vitamin D receptor, CBF1 (RBP-Jkappa), Smad2/3, and MyoD. It works with Ski in overcoming pRb-mediated cell cycle arrest, and it is targeted by the viral transactivators EBNA2 and E7 [[cite:PUB00043558]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12096" "NUCLEAR PROTEIN SKIP-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SKI-interacting protein, SKIP", "short" "SKI-int_prot_SKIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 56, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2605, "taxa" 9811, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5287, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5287, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3561}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017862", :literature {"PUB00043556" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Folk P" "Puta F" "Skruzny M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
