{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents fascin (FSCN) and its homologues, including FSCN1/2/3 from mammals and protein singed from fruit flies. Fascin is a globular actin cross-linking protein, which functions in forming parallel actin bundles in cell protrusions that are key specialisations of the plasma membrane for environmental guidance and cell migration [[cite:PUB00071711]]. Human FSCN1 organises filamentous actin into bundles with a minimum of 4.1:1 actin/fascin ratio. Overexpression of fascin has been linked to a more aggressive clinical course of cancer [[cite:PUB00071711]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10551" "FASCIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fascin", "short" "Fascin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1173, "taxa" 5049, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5182, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5182, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3236}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010431", :literature {"PUB00071711" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hashimoto Y" "Skacel M" "Adams JC."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
