{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of α/β-hydrolase fold-containing proteins mostly from plants and bacteria, including methylesterase (MES) and hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from Arabidopsis.</p>\n\n<p>There are at least 20 Arabidopsis MES members (AtMES1-AtMES20). The catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp is conserved in 15 of these proteins. However, AtMES19 and AtMES20 lack part of the N-terminal or C-terminal region, respectively, and are therefore likely to be inactive enzymes. Some members have been shown to hydrolyse MeIAA [[cite:PUB00099208]].</p>\n\n<p>AtHNL catalyses the cleavage of cyanohydrins to yield hydrocyanic acid (HCN) and the respective carbonyl compound and are key enzymes in the process of cyanogenesis in plants [[cite:PUB00099207]]. Interestingly, HNL homologue from Hevea brasiliensis, known as HbHNL, has opposite enantioselectivities and different reaction mechanisms compared to AtHNL [[cite:PUB00099206]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry also include pyrethroid hydrolase PytH from Sphingobium wenxiniae, which catalyses the hydrolysis of pyrethroids pesticides [[cite:PUB00099209]], and Norfluorocurarine synthase 1/2 from Strychnos nux-vomica, hydrolases involved in the biosynthesis of curare monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), natural products such as strychnine, a neurotoxic compound used as a pesticide to control rodents, and its pharmacologically active derivatives, including brucine, used to regulate blood pressure [[cite:PUB00155433]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yb6", "name" "Hydroxynitrile lyase from hevea brasiliensis in complex with mandelonitrile"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10992" "METHYLESTERASE FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylesterase/Alpha-hydroxynitrile lyase", "short" "MES/HNL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 922, "taxa" 4119, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9722, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9722, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6189}, "pathways" 31}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
