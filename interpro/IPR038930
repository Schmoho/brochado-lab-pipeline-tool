{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the precursors of CEP13 and CEP14.  These are found only in plants and although uncharacterized are thought to be extracellular signaling peptides that regulate primary root growth rate and nitrogen-demand signaling from comparison with CEP1 (UniProt:Q8L8Y3) [[cite:PUB00078263]].  The cep13 gene is induced by gibberelic acid and repressed by nitrogen and CEP13 accumulates in the roots in response to osmotic stress and depletion of nitrogen and ammonium chloride [[cite:PUB00088573]].  CEP13 is repressed in shoots by nitrogen starvation [[cite:PUB00078263]]. CEP14 is only slightly repressed in roots by carbon dioxide and induced in shoots by osmotic stress [[cite:PUB00078263]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37180" "PRECURSOR OF CEP14"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Precursor of CEP13/CEP14", "short" "CEP13/CEP14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 159, "taxa" 685, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 639, "sets" 0, "proteins" 639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 426}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038930", :literature {"PUB00078263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Delay C" "Imin N" "Djordjevic MA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
