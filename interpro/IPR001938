{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Thaumatin [[cite:PUB00001747]] is an intensely sweet-tasting protein, 100 000 times sweeter than sucrose on a molar basis [[cite:PUB00001747]], found in berries from Thaumatococcus daniellii, a tropical flowering plant known as Katemfe. It is induced by attack by viroids, which are single-stranded unencapsulated RNA molecules that do not code for protein.</p>\n<p>Thaumatin consists of about 200 residues and contains 8 disulphide bonds. Like other PR proteins, thaumatin is predicted to have a mainly β structure, with a high content of β-turns and little helix [[cite:PUB00001747]]. Several stress-induced proteins of plants have been found to be related to thaumatins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A maize alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor</li>\n<li>Two tobacco pathogenesis-related proteins: PR-R major and minor forms, which are induced after infection with viruses</li>\n<li>Salt-induced protein NP24 from tomato</li>\n<li>Osmotin, a salt-induced protein from tobacco [[cite:PUB00043682]]</li>\n<li>Osmotin-like proteins OSML13, OSML15 and OSML81 from potato [[cite:PUB00004582]]</li>\n<li>P21, a leaf protein from soybean</li>\n<li>PWIR2, a leaf protein from wheat [[cite:PUB00004543]]</li>\n<li>Zeamatin, a maize antifungal protein [[cite:PUB00004580]]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This family is also referred to as pathogenesis-related group 5 (PR5), as many thaumatin-like proteins accumulate in plants in response to infection by a pathogen and possess antifungal activity [[cite:PUB00004556]]. The proteins are involved in systemically acquired resistance and stress response in plants, although their precise role is unknown [[cite:PUB00004556]]. The PR5K receptor protein kinase from Arabidopsis comprises an extracellular domain related to the PR5 proteins, and an intracellular protein-serine/threonine kinase domain [[cite:PUB00088725]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8jz8", "name" "Subatomic structure of orthorhombic thaumatin at 0.89 Angstroms"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037176", "name" "Osmotin/thaumatin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31048" "OS03G0233200 PROTEIN"}, "profile" {"PS51367" "Thaumatin family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF00314" "Thaumatin family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002703" "Pathogenesis-related group 5 protein, thaumatin type"}, "smart" {"SM00205" "Thaumatin family"}, "prints" {"PR00347" "THAUMATIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thaumatin family", "short" "Thaumatin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 194, "domain_architectures" 378, "proteomes" 1312, "taxa" 4840, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19368, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18983, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11476}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00286", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00286"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
