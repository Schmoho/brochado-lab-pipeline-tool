{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a mid-life onset, inherited, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor impairment, involuntary movements (chorea), psychiatric disorders and dementia [[cite:PUB00003898]]. The disease results from the expansion of a polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat in a gene of unknown function. Moderate expansion of glutamine-coding CAG repeats has been found in other neurological diseases (e.g. spinobulbar muscular atrophy and Machado-Joseph disease), in all of which the pathological mechanism linked to the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the protein remains a mystery. <p>The HD transcript is highly conserved, significant differences, as already noted, occurring in the N-terminal Gln-repeat region. Huntingtin normally contains 10-35 repeats, but shows 36-120 repeats in the disease form. Migration differences between normal and mutated huntingtin in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel suggest that the poly-Gln stretch disrupts the protein conformation. This finding is consistent with the observation that Gln repeats may form tightly-linked Î²-sheets that could act as polar zippers [[cite:PUB00004844]]. It has been shown that neuronal inclusions of patients with Huntington's disease contains a broad range of N-terminal fragments of expanded huntingtin and insoluble polymers [[cite:PUB00061735]]. The polymerisation of the monomeric huntingtin bearing a polyglutamine expansion is selectively produced by transglutaminase [[cite:PUB00061735], [cite:PUB00061736]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011989", "name" "Armadillo-like helical", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00375" "HUNTINGTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Huntingtin", "short" "Huntingtin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 788, "taxa" 3153, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 9313, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2050, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 414}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000091", :literature {"PUB00003898" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Baxendale S" "Abdulla S" "Elgar G" "Buck D" "Berks M" "Micklem G" "Durbin R" "Bates G" "Brenner S" "Beck S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
