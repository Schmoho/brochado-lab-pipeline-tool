{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aspartate aminotransferase is important for the metabolism of amino acids and Krebs-cycle related organic acids. In plants, it is involved in nitrogen metabolism and in aspects of carbon and energy metabolism. The enzyme catalyses the reaction: <reaction> L-aspartate + 2-oxoglutarate = oxaloacetate + L-glutamate </reaction> Aminotransferases share certain mechanistic features with other pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzymes, such as the covalent binding of the pyridoxal-phosphate group to a lysine residue [[cite:PUB00002679]]. This family also includes some aromatic-amino-acid aminotransferases such as L-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase ucdG and Tyrosine aminotransferase TyrAT [[cite:PUB00153741], [cite:PUB00153740]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q7w", "name" "Structural Studies Reveals the Inactivation of E. coli L-aspartate aminotransferase (S)-4,5-amino-dihydro-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (SADTA) via two mechanisms at pH 6.0"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00799" "Aspartate aminotransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11879" "ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartate/other aminotransferase", "short" "Asp_trans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 179, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5090, "taxa" 19926, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31767, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30508, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21709}, "pathways" 95}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
