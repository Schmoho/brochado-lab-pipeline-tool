{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyses the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-SCoM) and coenzyme B (HS-CoB) to methane and the corresponding heterosulphide CoM-S-S-CoB ([ec:2.8.4.1]), the final step in methane biosynthesis. This reaction proceeds under anaerobic conditions by methanogenic Archaea [[cite:PUB00035993]], and requires a nickel-porphinoid prosthetic group, coenzyme F430, which is in the EPR-detectable Ni(I) oxidation state in the active enzyme. Studies on a catalytically inactive enzyme aerobically co-crystallized with coenzyme M displayed a fully occupied coenzyme M-binding site with no alternate conformations. The binding of coenzyme M appears to induce specific conformational changes that suggests a molecular mechanism by which the enzyme ensures that methyl-coenzyme M enters the substrate channel prior to coenzyme B, as required by the active-site geometry [[cite:PUB00010614]].</p>\r\n<p>MCR is a hexamer composed of 2 alpha, 2 beta, and 2 gamma subunits with two identical nickel porphinoid active sites, which form two long active site channels with F430 embedded at the bottom [[cite:PUB00006391], [cite:PUB00035994]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the gamma subunit, which has a complex α-helical/β-sheet topology.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5a0y", "name" "METHYL-COENZYME M REDUCTASE FROM METHANOTHERMOBACTER MARBURGENSIS AT 1.1 A RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009024", "name" "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase, ferredoxin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036994", "name" "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase, gamma subunit superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00539" "MCR_gamma"}, "pfam" {"PF02240" "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase gamma subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03259" "coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase subunit gamma"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000264" "Methyl coenzyme M reductase, gamma subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase, gamma subunit", "short" "Me_CoM_Rdtase_gsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 620, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 678, "sets" 0, "proteins" 678, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 600}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0722"} {"accession" "GenProp0719", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0719"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
