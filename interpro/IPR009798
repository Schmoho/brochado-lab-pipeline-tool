{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of several plant wound-induced protein sequences related to WI12 from Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Common ice plant) ([swissprot:Q9XES3]). Wounding, methyl jasmonate, and pathogen infection is known to induce local WI12 expression. WI12 expression is also thought to be developmentally controlled in the placenta and developing seeds. WI12 preferentially accumulates in the cell wall and it has been suggested that it plays a role in the reinforcement of cell wall composition after wounding and during plant development [[cite:PUB00013002]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032710", "name" "NTF2-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33703" "OS07G0691300 PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF07107" "Wound-induced protein WI12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Wound-induced protein Wun1-like", "short" "Wun1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 243, "taxa" 936, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1430, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1415, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 832}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009798", :literature {"PUB00013002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yen SK" "Chung MC" "Chen PC" "Yen HE."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.127.2.517", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Environmental and developmental regulation of the wound-induced cell wall protein WI12 in the halophyte ice plant.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "517-28", "volume" "127", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11598226}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009798", "name" "Wound-induced protein Wun1-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016533", "name" "Wound-induced protein 1/12, subgroup", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 811}}}
