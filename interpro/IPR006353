{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is a member of the Class IIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. Sequences in this family are all from eukaryotes. The human sequence is called \"Cat Eye Syndrome critical region protein 5\" (CECR5) [[cite:PUB00015450]], also known as Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing 5 (HDHD5). The gene codifying for this protein has been cloned from a pericentromere region of human chromosome 22 believed to be the location of the gene or genes responsible for Cat Eye Syndrome. This is one of a number of candidate genes.</p>\n\n<p>The Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast) sequence used to be annotated as \"phosphatidyl synthase\"  due to a C-terminal region of the protein (outside the region of similarity covered by this entry) which is highly homologous to a family of CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases. It is currently known as Cardiolipin synthase (CMP-forming) / mitochondrial hydrolase fusion protein as it is cleaved into two chains, one of which catalyses the synthesis of cardiolipin (CL) (diphosphatidylglycerol) by specifically transferring a phosphatidyl group from CDP-diacylglycerol to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) [[cite:PUB00151491]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Mitochondrial hydrolase YKR070W from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00042821]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3kc2", "name" "Crystal structure of mitochondrial HAD-like phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01456" "TIGR01456 family HAD-type hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD-superfamily hydrolase, subfamily IIA, CECR5", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IIA_CECR5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2265, "taxa" 7312, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6723, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6684, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4303}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
