{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains proteins with a putative zinc finger with three conserved cysteines and a histidine (Znf-C3H1) in the C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H conformation.</p>\n\n<p>NURS complex subunit red1 from the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> is required for the elimination of meiosis-specific mRNAs from mitotic cells by destabilising mRNAs containing a DSR degradation signal sequence [[cite:PUB00089402]]. In addition to Red1, the nuclear RNA silencing (NURS) includes the Mtl1, Red5, Ars2, Rmn1, and Iss10 proteins and associates with several other complexes that are involved in either signalling or mediating RNA silencing [[cite:PUB00094572]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes human zinc finger C3H1 domain-containing protein (Znf-C3H1). This is also required for mRNA degradation, and is a subunit of the trimeric poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) complex, which directs a subset of long and polyadenylated poly(A) RNAs for exosomal degradation [[cite:PUB00089403]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ygu", "name" "Crystal structure of the minimal Mtr4-Red1 complex (single chain) from Chaetomium thermophilum"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21563" "ZINC FINGER C3H1 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NURS complex subunit red1", "short" "Red1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1251, "taxa" 4426, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2659, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 629}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039278", :literature {"PUB00094572" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Egan ED" "Braun CR" "Gygi SP" "Moazed D."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Post-transcriptional regulation of meiotic genes by a nuclear RNA silencing complex.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "867-81", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24713849}, "PUB00089403" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Meola N" "Domanski M" "Karadoulama E" "Chen Y" "Gentil C" "Pultz D" "Vitting-Seerup K" "Lykke-Andersen S" "Andersen JS" "Sandelin A" "Jensen TH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
