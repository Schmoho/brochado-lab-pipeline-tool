{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Myotoxins are small basic peptides (42 to 45 residues) that can cause severe muscle necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. They act extremely rapidly and serve two primary biological functions: limiting the flight of prey by causing instantaneous paralysis of the hind limbs and promoting rapid death by paralysis of the diaphragm [[cite:PUB00001595], [cite:PUB00005315]]. These myotoxins have a well-conserved structure containing six cysteines involved in three disulphide bridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the better studied myotoxins is crotamine, from South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus. Crotamine is a multifunctional peptide with pharmacological interest; it can penetrate cells and has potential selective antitumoral activity together with its ability to inhibit the potassium current through voltage-gated potassium channels [[cite:PUB00068249]]. Similar toxins have been isolated from the venom of other rattlesnake species [[cite:PUB00068251]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gv5", "name" "X-ray structure of crotamine, a cell-penetrating peptide from the Brazilian snake Crotalus durissus terrificus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023355", "name" "Myotoxin/Anemone neurotoxin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00819" "Myotoxin, crotamine"}, "prosite" {"PS00459" "Myotoxins signature"}, "prints" {"PR00283" "MYOTOXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myotoxin", "short" "Myotoxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 63, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00435", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00435"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000881", :literature {"PUB00001595" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Griffin PR" "Aird SD."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(90)81325-I", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "A new small myotoxin from the venom of the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis viridis).", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "43-7", "volume" "274", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2253781}, "PUB00005315" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4-5", "authors" ["Samejima Y" "Aoki Y" "Mebs D."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0041-0101(91)90020-R", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Amino acid sequence of a myotoxin from venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus).", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "461-8", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1862521}, "PUB00068251" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Oguiura N" "Boni-Mitake M" "Radis-Baptista G."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2005.06.009", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "New view on crotamine, a small basic polypeptide myotoxin from South American rattlesnake venom.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "363-70", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16115660}, "PUB00068249" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Peigneur S" "Orts DJ" "Prieto da Silva AR" "Oguiura N" "Boni-Mitake M" "de Oliveira EB" "Zaharenko AJ" "de Freitas JC" "Tytgat J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
