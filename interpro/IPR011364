{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Breast cancer is a common malignancy, affecting 1 in 8 women. A major contributary factor in disease development lies in a positive family history, a correlation that is striking for early-onset breast cancer. Mutations in the DNA-damage repair protein BRCA1 [[cite:PUB00014583], [cite:PUB00014584]] are believed to be responsible for 45% of inherited breast cancer and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancer.</p>\n\n<p>The BRCA1 protein is a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that specifically mediates the formation of 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains and plays a central role in DNA repair by facilitating cellular responses to DNA damage [[cite:PUB00017952], [cite:PUB00066908]].  It contains an N-terminal zinc-finger domain. It also contains a BRCT C-terminal domain, an approximately 100 amino acid tandem repeat, which appears to act as a phospho-protein binding domain [[cite:PUB00014805]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00493" "BRSTCANCERI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1)", "short" "BRCA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 449, "taxa" 2198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5143, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 229}, "pathways" 51}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
