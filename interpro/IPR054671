{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This small family of proteins includes glucokinase (also known as Pcal_1032) from Pyrobaculum calidifontis and related sequences from Thermoproteaceae. These proteins belong to the ROK family of sugar kinases and catalyse the phosphorylation of D-glucose to D-glucose 6-phosphate using ATP as the phosphate donor. It has a broad hexose specificity, and in addition to glucose, which shows the highest catalytic efficiency, it can also phosphorylate fructose, mannose, galactose and sorbitol. It can also use CTP, GTP or UTP as phosphoryl donor [[cite:PUB00154768]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045551" "ATP-dependent glucokinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent glucokinase, pyrobaculum-type", "short" "GK_pyrobaculum-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 34, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
