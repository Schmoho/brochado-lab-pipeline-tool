{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aminoglycoside antibiotics constitute an important class of clinically useful drugs, including gentamicin, tobramycin, and streptomycin, which are used in the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections [[cite:PUB00033260]]. They work by targeting the bacterial ribosome and causing mistranslation of mRNA,  leading to the production of defective proteins. In many cases these defective proteins insert into the cell membrane, causing a loss of membrane integrity and precipitating cell death. The most common cause of resistance to these antibiotics is their modification by acetylating, adenylating or phosphorylating enzymes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferases, one of the best characterised aminoglycoside-resistance enzyme families. These enzymes transfer a phophoryl group from ATP to the 3' position of the aminoglycoside molecule. Studies indicate that these enzymes are both structurally and functionally homologous to eukaryotic protein kinases [[cite:PUB00014030], [cite:PUB00026966], [cite:PUB00027636]]. The enzyme contains two domains, an N-terminal domain composed mainly of an antiparallel β sheet, and a C-terminal domain which is largely α helical. The active site lies between these domains and comprises both the ATP binding site and the aminoglycoside binding site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fuc", "name" "Structure of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3'')-Id from Streptomyces rimosus ATCC10970"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000706" "Aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (kanamycin kinase)"}, "cdd" {"cd05150" "Aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminoglycoside 3-phosphotransferase", "short" "Kan/Strep_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 761, "taxa" 4156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4219, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4156, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3237}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
