{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR) couples the reduction of fumarate to succinate to the oxidation of quinol to quinone, the opposite reaction to that catalyzed by the related protein, succinate:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). QFR and SQR complexes are collectively referred to as succinate:quinone oxidoreductases and are predicted to share similar structures, containing either 3 or 4 subunits  [[cite:PUB00007431]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subunit A (the flavoprotein subunit) contains the site of fumarate reduction and a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide prosthetic group. Subunit B (the iron protein subunit) contains three iron-sulphur centres. Subunit(s) C (and D) (the membrane anchor subunits or cytochrome b subunits) include the membrane-spanning segments and binds haem b molecules [[cite:PUB00007431]]. The composition of these hydrophobic, cytochrome B subunits varies depending on the enzyme subtype.\r\n\r\nType A have two polypeptides, with three transmembrane helices each, and contain two protoheme IX molecules (denoted heme bH and heme bL). Type B have one polypeptide with five transmembrane helices and contain heme bH and heme bL. Type C have the same polypeptide arrangement as Type A, but contains only one protoheme IX molecule, corresponding to heme bH. Type D have two polypeptides, with three transmembrane helices each, and are without heme [[cite:PUB00015792]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bs2", "name" "QUINOL:FUMARATE REDUCTASE FROM WOLINELLA SUCCINOGENES"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR034804", "name" "Fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase, transmembrane subunit", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00581" "QFR_TypeB_TM"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000177" "Fumarate reductase, cytochrome b subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fumarate reductase type B, transmembrane subunit", "short" "Fum_red_B_TM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 193, "taxa" 1090, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 981, "sets" 0, "proteins" 976, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 767}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004224", :literature {"PUB00007431" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6760", "authors" ["Lancaster CR" "Kroger A" "Auer M" "Michel H."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/46483", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of fumarate reductase from Wolinella succinogenes at 2.2 A resolution.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "377-85", "volume" "402", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10586875}, "PUB00015792" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hagerhall C."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
