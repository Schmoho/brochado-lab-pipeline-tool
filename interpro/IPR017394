{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins contain a lateral organ boundaries (LOB) domain and are restricted to plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lateral organ boundaries (LOB) gene is expressed at the adaxial base of initiating lateral organs and encodes a plant-specific protein of unknown function. The N-terminal one half of the LOB protein contains a conserved approximately 100-amino acid domain (the LOB domain) that is present in 42 other Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and in proteins from a variety of other plant species. Genes encoding LOB domain (LBD) proteins are expressed in a variety of temporal- and tissue-specific patterns, suggesting that they may function in diverse processes [[cite:PUB00018358]]\r\nThe LOB domain contains conserved blocks of amino acids that identify the LBD gene family. In particular, a conserved C-x(2)-C-x(6)-C-x(3)-C motif, which is defining feature of the LOB domain, is present in all LBD proteins. It is possible that this motif forms a new zinc finger [[cite:PUB00018358]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038127" "Uncharacterised protein with LOB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LOB domain-containing protein 18/20", "short" "LOB_18/20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 49, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017394", :literature {"PUB00018358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Shuai B" "Reynaga-Pena CG" "Springer PS."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.010926", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "The lateral organ boundaries gene defines a novel, plant-specific gene family.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "747-61", "volume" "129", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12068116}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017394", "name" "LOB domain-containing protein 18/20", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
