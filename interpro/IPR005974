{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase, shows a high degree of conservation of structure, function, and amino acid sequence across wide phylogenetic ranges. All known Mo-nitrogenases consist of two components, component I (also called dinitrogenase, or Fe-Mo protein), an alpha2beta2 tetramer encoded by the nifD and nifK genes, and component II (dinitrogenase reductase, or Fe protein) a homodimer encoded by the nifH gene. Two operons, nifDK and nifEN, encode a tetrameric (alpha2beta2 and N2E2) enzymatic complex. Nitrogenase contains two unusual rare metal clusters; one of them is the iron molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), which is considered to be the site of dinitrogen reduction and whose biosynthesis requires the products of nifNE and of some other nif genes. It has been proposed that NifNE might serve as a scaffold upon which FeMo-co is built and then inserted into component I.</p>\n\n<p>This model represents the alpha chains of various forms of the nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase: vanadium-iron, iron-iron, and molybdenum-iron. Most examples of NifD, the molybdenum-iron type nitrogenase alpha chain, are excluded from this model and described instead by equivalog model [interpro:IPR005972].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7adr", "name" "CO bound as bridging ligand at the active site of vanadium nitrogenase VFe protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01284" "nitrogenase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogenase alpha chain", "short" "Nase_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 116, "taxa" 711, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 435, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 377}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
