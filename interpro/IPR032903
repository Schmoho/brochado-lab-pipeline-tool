{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes ferulic acid decarboxylase 1 (Fdc1) from fungi and bacterial pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid decarboxylase HudA (also known as UbiD-like decarboxylase and ferulic acid decarboxylase-like protein) [[cite:PUB00077013]]. HudA catalyses the prenyl-FMN-dependent decarboxylation of pyrrole-2-carboxylate (P2C) and it can also catalyse the carboxylation of pyrrole in the presence of elevated concentrations of CO2 or bicarbonate [[cite:PUB00103902]]. It attenuates the virulence of P.aeruginosa in a Drosophila model when overexpressed [[cite:PUB00077011]]. Budding yeast Fdc1 catalyses the reversible decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids like ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid or cinnamic acid, producing the corresponding vinyl derivatives (4-vinylphenol, 4-vinylguaiacol, and styrene respectively) which play the role of aroma metabolites [[cite:PUB00077013], [cite:PUB00077012]]. Fdc1 is not essential for ubiquinone synthesis [[cite:PUB00077012]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4zac", "name" "Structure of S. cerevisiae Fdc1 with the prenylated-flavin cofactor in the iminium form."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01983" "Pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferulic acid decarboxylase-like", "short" "FDC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 416, "taxa" 1354, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1175, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1175, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 778}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
