{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a set of Actinobacterial proteins, including Rv2632c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is strongly implicated in the onset of non-replicating persistence, and thereby latent tuberculosis. Rv2632c contains a dsRBD-like (2 layers α/β) fold (PDBe:2fgg). It shares remarkable similarity with bacterial hibernation factors, despite very low sequence similarity. Based on this structure it was predicted that Rv1738, highly up-regulated in conditions that mimic the onset of persistence, helps trigger dormancy by association with the bacterial ribosome [[cite:PUB00097447]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4wpy", "name" "Racemic crystal structure of Rv1738 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Form-II)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038070", "name" "Rv2632c-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08962" "Rv2632c-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rv2632c-like", "short" "Rv2632c-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 713, "taxa" 2119, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2872, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2872, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2042}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015057", :literature {"PUB00097447" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Bunker RD" "Mandal K" "Bashiri G" "Chaston JJ" "Pentelute BL" "Lott JS" "Kent SB" "Baker EN."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "A functional role of Rv1738 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence suggested by racemic protein crystallography.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "4310-5", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25831534}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015057", "name" "Rv2632c-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 32, "alignment:full" 1119}}}
