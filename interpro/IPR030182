However, the transporter function of other family members is not clear - they may act as transporters for nucleosides, nucleotides, and their derivatives [[cite:PUB00071873]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31376" "OS09G0467300 PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Purine permease, plant", "short" "PUP_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 251, "taxa" 1012, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6529, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3812}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030182", :literature {"PUB00071872" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Burkle L" "Cedzich A" "Dopke C" "Stransky H" "Okumoto S" "Gillissen B" "Kuhn C" "Frommer WB."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01700.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Transport of cytokinins mediated by purine transporters of the PUP family expressed in phloem, hydathodes, and pollen of Arabidopsis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "13-26", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12662305}, "PUB00071873" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Gillissen B" "Burkle L" "Andre B" "Kuhn C" "Rentsch D" "Brandl B" "Frommer WB."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.12.2.291", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "A new family of high-affinity transporters for adenine, cytosine, and purine derivatives in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "291-300", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10662864}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015211", "name" "purine nucleoside transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030182", "name" "Purine permease, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
