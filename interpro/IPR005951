{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ABC transporter family is a group of membrane proteins that use the hydrolysis of ATP to power the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). Eukaryotic ABC proteins are usually organised either as full transporters (containing two NBDs and two TMDs), or as half transporters (containing one NBD and one TMD), that have to form homo- or heterodimers in order to constitute a functional protein [[cite:PUB00072552]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Retinal-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4 (also known as the Rim protein, ABCR) is a eukaryotic protein belonging to the ABC-A subfamily of the ABC transporter family. In humans, ABCA4 is localised with opsin photopigments in outer segment disc membranes of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. It serves as an N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine importer [[cite:PUB00072118]]. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene cause Stargardt macular degeneration, a recessive disease characterised by the loss in central vision, progressive bilateral atrophy of photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, accumulation of fluorescent deposits in the macula, and a delay in dark adaptation [[cite:PUB00072119], [cite:PUB00072120]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01257" "rim ABC transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Retinal-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter", "short" "ABCA4/ABCR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 117, "taxa" 450, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 217, "sets" 0, "proteins" 217, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
