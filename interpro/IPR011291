{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small clade of dipeptidase enzymes from the   Lactobacillaceae, which belong to MEROPS peptidase family M20A.  The Lactococcus lactis enzyme has been shown to act on a wide range of dipeptides, but not larger peptides [[cite:PUB00079902]]. The enzyme from Lactobacillus delbrueckii was originally characterised as a Xaa-His dipeptidase, specifically a carnosinase (beta-Ala-His) by complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant.  Further study, including the crystallisation of the enzyme, has shown it to also be a non-specific dipeptidase [[cite:PUB00013828]]. This group also includes enzymes from Streptococcus and Enterococcus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1lfw", "name" "Crystal structure of pepV"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01886" "dipeptidase PepV"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M20A, peptidase V", "short" "Pept_M20A_peptidaseV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 146, "taxa" 719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1025, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1025, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 787}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
