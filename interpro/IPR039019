{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CatSperZ is a subunit of 9-subunit CatSper ion channel complex, involved in sperm cell hyperactivation [[cite:PUB00088758], [cite:PUB00093359], [cite:PUB00100197]]. Disruption of CatSperZ resulted in male subfertility; fewer calcium ions were able to pass through the channels to enter the cell, affecting the proximal flagellum flexibility and preventing sperm from migrating efficiently. CatSperZ may represent an evolutionary adaptation to maximize fertilization inside the mammalian female reproductive tract [[cite:PUB00088758]]. Together with EFCAB9, CatSperZ associates with the CatSper channel pore and is required for the two-row structure of each single CatSper channel [[cite:PUB00093359]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42155" "CATION CHANNEL SPERM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN SUBUNIT ZETA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cation channel sperm-associated auxiliary subunit zeta", "short" "CATSPERZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 108, "taxa" 390, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 177, "sets" 0, "proteins" 177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 111}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039019", :literature {"PUB00100197" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7869", "authors" ["Lin S" "Ke M" "Zhang Y" "Yan Z" "Wu J."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of a mammalian sperm cation channel complex.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "746-750", "volume" "595", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34225353}, "PUB00093359" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hwang JY" "Mannowetz N" "Zhang Y" "Everley RA" "Gygi SP" "Bewersdorf J" "Lishko PV" "Chung JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Dual Sensing of Physiologic pH and Calcium by EFCAB9 Regulates Sperm Motility.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1480-1494.e19", "volume" "177", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31056283}, "PUB00088758" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Chung JJ" "Miki K" "Kim D" "Shim SH" "Shi HF" "Hwang JY" "Cai X" "Iseri Y" "Zhuang X" "Clapham DE."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23082", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "CatSperÎ¶ regulates the structural continuity of sperm Ca2+ signaling domains and is required for normal fertility.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28226241}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030317", "name" "flagellated sperm motility", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0048240", "name" "sperm capacitation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0036128", "name" "CatSper complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039019", "name" "Cation channel sperm-associated auxiliary subunit zeta", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
