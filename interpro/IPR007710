{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase (NDT) ([ec:2.4.2.6]) catalyses the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds of 2-deoxyribonucleosides. Nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferases can be divided into two groups based on their substrate specificity: class I enzymes are specific for the transfer of deoxyribose between two purines, while class II enzymes will transfer the deoxyribose between either purines or pyrimidines. The structure of the class I [[cite:PUB00015073]] and class II [[cite:PUB00015074]] enzymes are very similar. In class I enzymes, the purine base shields the active site from solvent, which the smaller pyrimidine base cannot do, while in class II enzymes the active site is shielded by a loop (residues 48-62). Both classes of enzymes are found in various Lactobacillus species and participate in nucleoside recycling in these microorganisms. This entry represents both classes of enzymes.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the related enzyme deoxynucleoside 5-monophosphate N-glycosidase (DNPH1), also known as 5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP N-hydrolase ([ec:3.2.2]). DNPH1 is related to NDT in structure and enzymatic activity, but in contrast to NDT catalyses the hydrolysis of 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate to yield a free nucleobase and 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate [[cite:PUB00068837], [cite:PUB00088377]]. DNPH1 is a potential proto-oncogene [[cite:PUB00088378]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6qai", "name" "2-desoxiribosyltransferase from Leishmania mexicana"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05014" "Nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase", "short" "Nucleoside_deoxyribTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 54, "proteomes" 1725, "taxa" 9489, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8922, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8882, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6588}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
