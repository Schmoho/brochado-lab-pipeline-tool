{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Borna disease virus (BDV) is a non-cytolytic, neurotropic RNA virus that has a broad host range in warm-blooded animals. BDV is an enveloped virus, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome and has an organisation characteristic of a member of Bornaviridae in the order of Mononegavirale. This family consists of several BDV P24 (phosphoprotein 24) proteins. They are essential components of the RNA polymerase transcription and replication complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06595" "Borna disease virus P24 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Borna disease virus P24", "short" "BDV_P24"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 80, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 159, "sets" 0, "proteins" 159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009517", :literature {"PUB00043634" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Zhang G" "Kobayashi T" "Kamitani W" "Komoto S" "Yamashita M" "Baba S" "Yanai H" "Ikuta K" "Tomonaga K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
