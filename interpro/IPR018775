{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins that belong to the DNA polymerase beta superfamily, with closest affinities to the Minimal Nucleotide Transferase clade (MNT). They are found in diverse RNA repair genome contexts centred on both RtcB and Rnl-type (ATP-grasp fold) repair ligases [[cite:PUB00091037]]. Members of this family of bacterial proteins catalyze the transfer of nucleotide residues from nucleoside diphosphates or triphosphates into dimer or polymer forms.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34817" "NUCLEOTIDYLTRANSFERASE"}, "pfam" {"PF10127" "RNA repair pathway DNA polymerase beta family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA repair pathway DNA polymerase beta", "short" "RlaP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 27, "proteomes" 2102, "taxa" 10475, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10480, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10382, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6621}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018775", :literature {"PUB00091037" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw722", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "RNA damage in biological conflicts and the diversity of responding RNA repair systems.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "8525-8555", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27536007}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018775", "name" "RNA repair pathway DNA polymerase beta", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 2831}}}
