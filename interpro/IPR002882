{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains 2-phospho-L-lactate transferase (CofD), phosphoenolpyruvate transferase and related sequences. CofD catalyses the fourth step in the biosynthesis of coenzyme F420, which is the transfer of the 2-phospholactate moiety from lactyl (2) diphospho-(5') guanosine (LPPG) to 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) with the formation of the L-lactyl phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (F420-0) and GMP. F420 is a flavin derivative found in methanogens, Mycobacteria, and several other lineages. This enzyme is characterised so far in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) [[cite:PUB00013496], [cite:PUB00050875]] but appears restricted to F420-containing species and is predicted to carry out the same function in these other species. CofD monomer contains twelve β-strands, seven of them forming a Rossmann fold, and thirteen α-helices [[cite:PUB00050875]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q7x", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative phospho transferase (sp_1565) from streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 at 2.00 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038136", "name" "CofD-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01933" "2-phospho-L-lactate transferase CofD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-phospho-L-lactate transferase CofD", "short" "CofD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 77, "proteomes" 5873, "taxa" 23148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28290, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28222, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21256}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
