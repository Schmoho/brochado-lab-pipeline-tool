{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mechanosensitive ion channels (MscL) play a critical role in transducing physical stresses at the cell membrane into an electrochemical response. MscL is a protein which forms a channel organised as a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane regions [[cite:PUB00005232], [cite:PUB00053088], [cite:PUB00097422]]. Prokaryotes harbor a large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (gene mscL) that opens in response to stretch forces in the membrane lipid bilayer and participate in the regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell [[cite:PUB00003881]]. MscL has a conserved domain architecture which comprises an amphipathic α-helix (S1) that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane, a highly conserved first transmembrane domain (TM1) that forms the pore constriction, a periplasmic loop, a second transmembrane domain (TM2) that faces the lipid membrane, and a linker that leads to a cytoplasmic α-helical bundle [[cite:PUB00097422]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family also includes anditomin synthesis protein L (AndL), which is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of anditomin.
