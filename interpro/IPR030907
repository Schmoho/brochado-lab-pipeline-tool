{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two families of proteins are encoded next to the encapsulin gene ([interpro:IPR007544]): one is an enzyme family that includes Dyp-type peroxidases, the other resembles the bacterioferritins and is represented by this entry. Encapsulin-associated forms of the proteins in these two families have a necessary C-terminal motif that resembles DGSL[SGN]IGSL[KR].</p>\n\n<p>Members of these entry are cargo proteins of the encapsulin nanocompartment [[cite:PUB00153688]]. These are ferritin-like ferroxidases that mineralizes iron inside the encapsulin nanocompartment [[cite:PUB00100754], [cite:PUB00100753]]. Converts Fe2 to Fe3 that is released to the exterior of the decameric complex for deposition in the encapsulin nanocompartment. In solution the decamer binds 10-15 iron cations; in the encapsulin nanocompartment the decamer can bind up to 48 ions, perhaps via its internal channel and on its exterior. The empty encapsulin nanocompartment sequesters about 2200 Fe ions while the cargo-loaded nanocompartment can maximally sequester about 4150 Fe ions. EncFtn retains ferroxidase activity when encapsulated [[cite:PUB00100753]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04535" "encapsulin-associated ferritin-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Encapsulin-associated ferritin-like", "short" "Ferrit_encaps"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 310, "taxa" 1722, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 914}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0810", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0810"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
