{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The members of this family are eukaryotic fatty acid CoA synthetases that activate fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 20. LC-FACS catalyses the formation of fatty acyl-CoA in a two-step reaction: the formation of a fatty acyl-AMP molecule as an intermediate, and the formation of a fatty acyl-CoA. This is a required step before free fatty acids can participate in most catabolic and anabolic reactions [[cite:PUB00098524], [cite:PUB00098522]]. Organisms tend to have multiple isoforms of LC-FACS genes with multiple splice variants. For example, nine genes are found in Arabidopsis and six genes are expressed in mammalian cells [[cite:PUB00098523], [cite:PUB00098522]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05927" "Eukaryotic long-chain fatty acid CoA synthetase (LC-FACS)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Long-chain fatty acid CoA synthetase, eukaryotic", "short" "LC-FACS_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1380, "taxa" 5418, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10322, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10315, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5914}, "pathways" 89}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
