{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents plant Protein ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS 6 (ARC6) and its paralogue PARC6, components of the plastid division machinery which are essential for the chloroplast replication process [[cite:PUB00096838], [cite:PUB00096839]]. ARC6 is evolutionarily related to the cyanobacterial cell division protein Ftn2/ZipN [[cite:PUB00096838]], being unique to the division machineries of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Their sequences share about 19% identity and are quite conserved along their length. Chloroplast division implies the assembly and constriction of the tubulin-like FtsZ ring on the stromal surface of the inner envelope membrane (IEM) and the dynamin-like ARC5 ring on the cytosolic surface of the outer envelope membrane (OEM). The assembly of these structures is coordinated by a pair of paralogous proteins, ARC6 and PARC6 from the IEM, and PDV2 and PDV1 from the OEM. They contain single transmembrane (TM) domains towards their C terminus with short C-terminal regions extending into the intermembrane space (IMS) [[cite:PUB00096838], [cite:PUB00096839], [cite:PUB00096836], [cite:PUB00096837], [cite:PUB00096840]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33925" "PLASTID DIVISION PROTEIN CDP1, CHLOROPLASTIC-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS 6-like", "short" "ARC6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 483, "taxa" 2418, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2190, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2190, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1404}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044685", :literature {"PUB00096836" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Vitha S" "Froehlich JE" "Koksharova O" "Pyke KA" "van Erp H" "Osteryoung KW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "ARC6 is a J-domain plastid division protein and an evolutionary descendant of the cyanobacterial cell division protein Ftn2.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1918-33", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12897262}, "PUB00096837" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Glynn JM" "Froehlich JE" "Osteryoung KW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis ARC6 coordinates the division machineries of the inner and outer chloroplast membranes through interaction with PDV2 in the intermembrane space.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "2460-70", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18812496}, "PUB00096838" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kumar N" "Radhakrishnan A" "Su CC" "Osteryoung KW" "Yu EW."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Crystal structure of a conserved domain in the intermembrane space region of the plastid division protein ARC6.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "523-9", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26452626}, "PUB00096839" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang M" "Chen C" "Froehlich JE" "TerBush AD" "Osteryoung KW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Roles of Arabidopsis PARC6 in Coordination of the Chloroplast Division Complex and Negative Regulation of FtsZ Assembly.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "250-62", "volume" "170", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26527658}, "PUB00096840" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ishikawa H" "Yasuzawa M" "Koike N" "Sanjaya A" "Moriyama S" "Nishizawa A" "Matsuoka K" "Sasaki S" "Kazama Y" "Hayashi Y" "Abe T" "Fujiwara MT" "Itoh RD."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "Arabidopsis PARC6 Is Critical for Plastid Morphogenesis in Pavement, Trichome, and Guard Cells in Leaf Epidermis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1665", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32010156}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044685", "name" "Protein ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS 6-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
