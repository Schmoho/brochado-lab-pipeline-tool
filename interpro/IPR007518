{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes known as the MINDY family (MIU-containing novel DUB).  Ubiquitin (Ub) is released one molecule at a time from the distal end of proteins with Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains.  Long polyubiquitin chains are preferred.  The catalytic Cys and His residues have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis, as has the Gln that participates in formation of the oxyanion hole during catalysis.  Despite the structural similarity to papain-like cysteine peptidases, a residue corresponding to the Asn that orientates the imidazolium ring of the catalytic His has not been identified.  Members of the MINDY family of DUBs contain an MIU (motif interacting with Ub) motif, which is a helical motif that binds mono-Ub [[cite:PUB00081935]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6k6l", "name" "YGL082W-catalytic domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18063" "NF-E2 INDUCIBLE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MINDY deubiquitinase", "short" "MINDY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2370, "taxa" 7720, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5603, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3692}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
