The direction of gravity is perceived by plants mainly by gravity-sensing cells (statocytes), which detect the sedimentation of starch-accumulating high-density amyloplasts. This results in a chemical signal that is transmitted to responding tissues (auxin transport), where the signal induces the differential growth of the lower and upper surfaces of gravity-responsive organs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34959" "PROTEIN LAZY 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein LAZY1", "short" "LAZY1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 858, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1056, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1056, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 632}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038928", :literature {"PUB00088567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Yoshihara T" "Iino M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcm042", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "Identification of the gravitropism-related rice gene LAZY1 and elucidation of LAZY1-dependent and -independent gravity signaling pathways.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "678-88", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17412736}, "PUB00088568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Li P" "Wang Y" "Qian Q" "Fu Z" "Wang M" "Zeng D" "Li B" "Wang X" "Li J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2007.38", "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "402-10", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17468779}, "PUB00088569" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yoshihara T" "Spalding EP" "Iino M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.12118", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "AtLAZY1 is a signaling component required for gravitropism of the Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "267-79", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23331961}, "PUB00088570" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Dong Z" "Jiang C" "Chen X" "Zhang T" "Ding L" "Song W" "Luo H" "Lai J" "Chen H" "Liu R" "Zhang X" "Jin W."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.113.227314", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Maize LAZY1 mediates shoot gravitropism and inflorescence development through regulating auxin transport, auxin signaling, and light response.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1306-22", "volume" "163", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24089437}, "PUB00088571" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Taniguchi M" "Furutani M" "Nishimura T" "Nakamura M" "Fushita T" "Iijima K" "Baba K" "Tanaka H" "Toyota M" "Tasaka M" "Morita MT."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.16.00575", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The Arabidopsis LAZY1 Family Plays a Key Role in Gravity Signaling within Statocytes and in Branch Angle Control of Roots and Shoots.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1984-1999", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28765510}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009630", "name" "gravitropism", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:2000012", "name" "regulation of auxin polar transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR038928", "name" "Protein LAZY1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
