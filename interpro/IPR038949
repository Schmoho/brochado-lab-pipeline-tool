{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents homologues of Tektin-like protein 1 (TEKTL1 also known as Ccdc105). TEKTL1 is a conserved tektin-like sperm microtubule inner protein (MIP) that decorate the lumen of axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs) and stabilise the structure. The tertiary structure of TEKTL1 is similar to that of tektins [[cite:PUB00151496]]. However, the mechanism by which TEKTL1 and tektins assemble into filaments differs slightly. TEKTL1 shares many structural features with tektins, including the overall helix-turn-helix fold and head-to-tail association into filaments, but does not\nseem to assemble into the large oligomeric bundles associated with tektins. In both sea urchin and bovine sperm, TEKTL1 binds to the outer inter-protofilament cleft of A11/A12, where it may help stabilise the outer junction [[cite:PUB00151496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35081" "COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 105"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tektin-like protein 1", "short" "TEKTL1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 315, "taxa" 1359, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 586, "sets" 0, "proteins" 586, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 374}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038949", :literature {"PUB00151496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Leung MR" "Zeng J" "Wang X" "Roelofs MC" "Huang W" "Zenezini Chiozzi R" "Hevler JF" "Heck AJR" "Dutcher SK" "Brown A" "Zhang R" "Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.05.026", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural specializations of the sperm tail.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2880-2896.e17", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37327785}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048256", "name" "Tektin-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000435", "name" "Tektins", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR038949", "name" "Tektin-like protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
