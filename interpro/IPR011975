{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme is proposed to act in the ring-opening step of phenylacetic acid degradation [[cite:PUB00015494]] which follows ligation of the acid with coenzyme A (by PaaF) and hydroxylation by a multicomponent non-heme iron hydroxylase complex (PaaGHIJK).  Gene symbols have been standardized in [[cite:PUB00015522]].  This enzyme is related to aldehyde dehydrogenase family. This family includes sequences from Burkholderia, Bordetella, Streptomyces.
