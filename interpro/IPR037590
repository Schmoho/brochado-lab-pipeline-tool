{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents GATOR complex protein WDR24, a component of the GATOR subcomplex GATOR2.  GATOR2 is part of the amino acid-sensing branch of the TORC1 signalling pathway, activating mTORC1 by inhibition of the GATOR1 subcomplex.  The GATOR2 complex consists of MIOS, SEC13, SEH1L, WDR24 and WDR59 [[cite:PUB00085662]].  WDR24 has a secondary role in the GATOR-independent promotion of lysosome acidity and regulation of autophagic flux [[cite:PUB00087299]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the restriction of telomere capping protein 1 (Rtc1 or Sea2) from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  It is a component of the SEA complex, termed as GATOR in mammals, which coats the vacuolar membrane and is involved in intracellular trafficking, autophagy, response to nitrogen starvation, and amino acid biogenesis [[cite:PUB00063317], [cite:PUB00087166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46200" "GATOR COMPLEX PROTEIN WDR24"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GATOR2 complex protein WDR24", "short" "WDR24"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2077, "taxa" 7049, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3658, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1907}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2029"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
