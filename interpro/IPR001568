{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonuclease T2 (RNase T2) is a widespread family of secreted RNases found in every organism examined thus far.  This family includes RNase Rh, RNase MC1, RNase LE, and self-incompatibility RNases (S-RNases) [[cite:PUB00080049], [cite:PUB00080050], [cite:PUB00036440], [cite:PUB00022764], [cite:PUB00080051]].  Plant T2 RNases are expressed during leaf senescence in order to scavenge phosphate from ribonucleotides. They are also expressed in response to wounding or pathogen invasion. S-RNases are thought to prevent self-fertilization by acting as selective cytotoxins of \"self\" pollen. Generally, RNases have two distinct binding sites: the primary site (B1 site) and the subsite (B2 site), for nucleotides located at the 5'- and 3'- terminal ends of the sissile bond, respectively.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The fungal ribonucleases T2 from Aspergillus oryzae, M from Aspergillus saitoi and Rh from Rhizopus niveus are structurally and functionally related 30 Kd glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00002342]] that cleave the 3'-5' internucleotide linkage of RNA via a nucleotide 2',3'-cyclic phosphate intermediate ([ec:3.1.27.1]).
