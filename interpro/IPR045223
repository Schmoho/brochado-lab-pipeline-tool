{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the small ribosomal subunit protein RACK1 from eukaryotes, previously known as guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-like (also known as Asc1 in yeast) [[cite:PUB00106455], [cite:PUB00110894]]. They are core 40S ribosomal proteins that repress gene expression [[cite:PUB00098297]] and involved in induction of the ribosome quality control (RQC) pathway, a pathway that degrades nascent peptide chains during problematic translation [[cite:PUB00101521], [cite:PUB00086968]]. The seven-bladed β-propeller structure of RACK1 is located near the mRNA exit tunnel where it makes contacts with the ribosomal RNA through lysine and arginine residues and neighbouring ribosomal proteins [[cite:PUB00031553]]. Asc1/RACK1 are key factors in phosphosignaling and functions as a control point at the head of the ribosomal 40S subunit itself regulated through posttranslational modification [[cite:PUB00101522]]. RACK1 also serves as a scaffold protein that can recruit other proteins to the ribosome and also for a wide range of kinases and membrane bound receptors [[cite:PUB00098299], [cite:PUB00098298]]. It has been shown to regulates axonal growth [[cite:PUB00098304]] and is essential for development in mice, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00098306], [cite:PUB00098305], [cite:PUB00098300]].
