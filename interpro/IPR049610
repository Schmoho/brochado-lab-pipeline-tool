{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Low-complexity tail membrane proteins (LCTMP) found mainly in cyanobacteria. Members of this family appear typically as an unusual gene pair with members of [interpro:IPR021883]. The members tend to have tail-to-tail overlapping regions, where the tail region from this protein is long, low-complexity, and typically rich in Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Ser, and Thr. The function of this pair of convergently-transcribed overlapping proteins is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033183" "low-complexity tail membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Low-complexity tail membrane protein-like", "short" "LCTMP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 135, "taxa" 794, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 476, "sets" 0, "proteins" 476, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 323}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049610", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049610", "name" "Low-complexity tail membrane protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
