{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of poorly uncharacterised archaeal proteins, such as MJ0037 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, that share a motif approximating DXH(X25)GDXXD(X25)GNHD as found in several phosphoesterases, including the nucleases SbcD and Mre11. SbcD is a subunit of the SbcCD nuclease of Escherichia coli that can cleave DNA hairpins to unblock stalled DNA replication.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00024" "putative phosphoesterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoesterase MJ0037", "short" "Pesterase_MJ0037"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 92, "taxa" 836, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1075, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1075, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 824}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004376", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024173", "name" "Phosphoesterase MJ0037-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004376", "name" "Phosphoesterase MJ0037", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026336", "name" "Ligase-associated DNA damage response endonuclease PdeM-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
