{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the plant LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins, which are small hydrophilic plant seed proteins that are structurally related. These proteins contains from 83 to 153 amino acid residues and may play a role [[cite:PUB00015278], [cite:PUB00003758]] in equipping the seed for survival, maintaining a minimal level of hydration in the dry organism and preventing the denaturation of cytoplasmic components. They may also play a role during imbibition by controlling water uptake.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34671" "EM-LIKE PROTEIN GEA1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small hydrophilic plant seed protein", "short" "Small_hydrophilic_seed_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 252, "taxa" 1008, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1022, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1022, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 646}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00355", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00355"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000389", :literature {"PUB00015278" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bray EA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/reprint/103/4/1035.pdf", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Molecular Responses to Water Deficit.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "1035-1040", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12231998}, "PUB00003758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gaubier P" "Raynal M" "Hull G" "Huestis GM" "Grellet F" "Arenas C" "Pages M" "Delseny M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
