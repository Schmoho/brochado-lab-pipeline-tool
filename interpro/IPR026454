{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are found, so far, exclusively in the genus Acinetobacter. Members average just over 600 amino acids in length, including a 22-amino acid C-terminal putative protein sorting recognition sequence, GlyGly-CTERM. The GlyGly-CTERM signal always co-occurs with a subfamily of the rhomboid family intramembrane serine proteases called rhombosortase. Members occur paired with a second rhombosortase target, with which it also shares an N-terminal motif CSLREA. This protein is designated Acinetobacter rhombotarget A (rbtA).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011050", "name" "Pectin lyase fold/virulence factor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04212" "rhombotarget A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhombotarget A", "short" "Rhombotarget_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 277, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 345, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 248}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026454", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026454", "name" "Rhombotarget A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
