{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the enzyme 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase, which acts on its two substrates at the same active site , and similar sequences mainly found in alphaproteobacteria. This group of sequences is related but distinct to [interpro:IPR010049]. This enzyme is involved in the recycling of the components of S-adenosylmethionine after it has donated one of its two non-ribose sulphur ligands to an acceptor.  In the case of 5'-methylthioadenosine this represents the first step of the methionine salvage pathway in bacteria [[cite:PUB00106629]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01705" "5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase, putative", "short" "MTA_SAH_nuc_hyp"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 338, "taxa" 1287, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1322, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1322, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1109}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010050", :literature {"PUB00106629" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kang X" "Zhao Y" "Jiang D" "Li X" "Wang X" "Wu Y" "Chen Z" "Zhang XC."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "Crystal structure and biochemical studies of Brucella melitensis 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "965-70", "volume" "446", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24657441}, "PUB00013756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sekowska A" "Danchin A."], "ISO_journal" "DNA Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/dnares/6.5.255", "medline_journal" "DNA Res", "title" "Identification of yrrU as the methylthioadenosine nucleosidase gene in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "255-64", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10574451}, "PUB00013829" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Lee JE" "Cornell KA" "Riscoe MK" "Howell PL."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00656-6", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure of E. coli 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase reveals similarity to the purine nucleoside phosphorylases.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "941-53", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11591349}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010050", "name" "5-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
