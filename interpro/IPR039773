{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>BAG domains are present in Bcl-2-associated athanogene 1 and silencer of death domains. The BAG proteins are modulators of chaperone activity, they bind to HSP70/HSC70 proteins and promote substrate release. The proteins have anti-apoptotic activity and increase the anti-cell death function of BCL-2 induced by various stimuli.  BAG-1 binds to the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 or Hsc70/Hsp70 in a mutually exclusive interaction. BAG-1 promotes cell growth by binding to and stimulating Raf-1 activity. The binding of Hsp70 to BAG-1 diminishes Raf-1 signalling and inhibits subsequent events, such as DNA synthesis, as well as arrests the cell cycle. BAG-1 has been suggested to function as a molecular switch that encourages cells to proliferate in normal conditions but become quiescent under a stressful environment  [[cite:PUB00009773], [cite:PUB00028930]].</p>\n\n<p>BAG-family proteins contain a single BAG domain, except for human BAG-5 which has four BAG repeats [[cite:PUB00054479]]. The BAG domain is a conserved region located at the C terminus of the BAG-family proteins that binds the ATPase domain of Hsc70/Hsp70. The BAG domain is evolutionarily conserved, and BAG domain containing proteins have been described and/or proven in a variety of organisms including Mus musculus (Mouse), Xenopus spp., Drosophila spp., Bombyx mori (Silk moth), Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast), and Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress).</p>\n\n<p>The BAG domain has 110-124 amino acids and is comprised of three anti-parallel  Î±-helices, each approximately 30-40 amino acids in length. The first and second helices interact with the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 and the second and third helices are the sites of the BAG domain interaction with the ATPase domain of Hsc70/Hsp70. Binding of the BAG domain to the ATPase domain is mediated by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in BAG-1 and is energy requiring.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4hwf", "name" "Crystal structure of ATBAG3"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12329" "BCL2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molecular chaperone regulator BAG", "short" "BAG_chaperone_regulator"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1444, "taxa" 5587, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7213, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7213, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4704}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039773", :literature {"PUB00009773" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Doong H" "Vrailas A" "Kohn EC."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3835(02)00456-1", "medline_journal" "Cancer Lett", "title" "What's in the 'BAG'?--A functional domain analysis of the BAG-family proteins.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "25-32", "volume" "188", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12406544}, "PUB00028930" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Briknarova K" "Takayama S" "Homma S" "Baker K" "Cabezas E" "Hoyt DW" "Li Z" "Satterthwait AC" "Ely KR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
