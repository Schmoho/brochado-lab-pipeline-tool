{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In general, members of this family methylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3. It also methylates 'Lys-27' of histone H3 [[cite:PUB00058058]] and 'Lys-20' of H4, and cytosine [[cite:PUB00058059]]. H3 'Lys-9' methylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression [[cite:PUB00058060]].</p>\n\n<p>This enzyme plays a central role in gene silencing [[cite:PUB00058061]]. The silencing mechanism via DNA CpNpG methylation requires the targeting of chromomethylase CMT3 to methylated histones, probably through an interaction with an heterochromatin protein 1-like adapter. Arabidopsis homologue SUVH4 is directly required for the maintenance of the DNA CpNpG and asymmetric methylation. It is also involved in the silencing of transposable elements [[cite:PUB00058062], [cite:PUB00058063], [cite:PUB00058064], [cite:PUB00058065], [cite:PUB00058066]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (EC [ec:2.1.1.-]) constitute an important class of enzymes present in every life form.
