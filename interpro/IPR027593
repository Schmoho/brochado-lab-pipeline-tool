{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are absolutely restricted to the Mollicutes (Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma). All have a signal peptide, usually of the lipoprotein type, suggesting surface expression. Most members have lengths of about 280 residues but some members have a nearly full-length duplication. The mostly nearly invariant residue, a Trp,is part of a strongly conserved 9-residue motif, [ND]-W-[LY]-[WF]-X-[LF]-X-N-[LI], where X usually is hydrophobic. Because the hydrophobic six-residue core of this motif almost always contains three to four aromatic residues, this family was called aromatic cluster surface protein. Multiple paralogues may occur in a given Mycoplasma, usually clustered on the genome.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04313" "aromatic motif membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aromatic cluster surface protein", "short" "Aro_clust"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 45, "taxa" 151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 432, "sets" 0, "proteins" 387, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 296}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027593", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027593", "name" "Aromatic cluster surface protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
