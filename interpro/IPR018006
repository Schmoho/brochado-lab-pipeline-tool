{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many flagellar proteins are exported by a flagellum-specific export pathway. Attempts have been made to characterise the apparatus responsible for this process, by designing assays to screen for mutants with export defects [[cite:PUB00002143]]. Experiments involving filament removal from temperature-sensitive flagellar mutants of Salmonella typhimurium have shown that, while most mutants were able to regrow filaments, flhA, fliH, fliI and fliN mutants showed no or greatly reduced regrowth. This suggests that the corresponding gene products are involved in the process of flagellum-specific export. The sequences of fliH, fliI and the adjacent gene, fliJ, have been deduced. FliJ was shown to encode a protein of molecular mass 17,302 Da [[cite:PUB00002143]]. It is a membrane-associated protein that affects chemotactic events, mutations in FliJ result in failure to respond to chemotactic stimuli.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This subgroup is dominated by FliJ proteins found in Proteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053716", "name" "Flagellar assembly and chemotaxis effector", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF019404" "Flagellin export apparatus soluble chaperone FliJ"}, "prints" {"PR01004" "FLGFLIJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar FliJ, proteobacteria", "short" "Flag_FliJ_proteobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 735, "taxa" 4150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5293, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4253, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3355}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018006", :literature {"PUB00002143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Vogler AP" "Homma M" "Irikura VM" "Macnab RM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
