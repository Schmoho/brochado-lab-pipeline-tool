{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents homologues of the Internal scaffolding protein VP3 found mainly in Microviridae.</p>\n\n<p>Some members of this entry are encoded by genes in chlamydiaphage such as Vp3. These viruses have around eight genes and infect obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens of the genus Chlamydia. This protein is annotated as VP3 or structural protein (as if a protein of mature viral particles), however, it is displaced from procapsids as DNA is packaged, and therefore is more correctly described as a scaffolding protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09675" "Chlamydia-phage Chp2 scaffold (Chlamy_scaf)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chlamydia phage, Vp3, scaffold", "short" "Chlamydia_phage_Vp3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 400, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1146, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1146, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014131", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014131", "name" "Chlamydia phage, Vp3, scaffold", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 65}}}
