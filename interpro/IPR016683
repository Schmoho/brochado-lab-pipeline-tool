{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([ec:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [[cite:PUB00009409]]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Glycosyltransferase family 28 [cazy:GT28] comprises enzymes with a number of known activities; 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-galactosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1.46]); 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-glucosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1.157]); beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase ([ec:2.4.1]).\r\n Structural analysis suggests the C-terminal domain contains the UDP-GlcNAc binding site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group represents a predicted family 28 glycosyltransferase, RedA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017085" "Predicted glycosyltransferase, RedA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyl transferase, family 28, RedA, predicted", "short" "Glyco_trans_28_RedA_prd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 274, "taxa" 1327, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1111, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 887}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016683", :literature {"PUB00009409" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Campbell JA" "Davies GJ" "Bulone V" "Henrissat B."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
