{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In photolithouautotrophic and chemolithouautotrophic bacteria that utilise sulphide as a hydrogen source, Sulphide Quinone Reductase (SQR) is critical in the initial oxidation step of sulphide. The electrons generated from the oxidation of sulphide are used to generate NADH. SQR is a member of the disulphide containing pyridine dinucleotide oxidoreductase family. The members of this protein include glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, mercuric ion reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase and they all shuttle electrons from NADPH through FAD to a disulphide/dithiol active site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10632" "SULFIDE:QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphide quinone-reductase", "short" "Sulphide_quinone_reductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3288, "taxa" 12987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10065, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10065, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7183}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
