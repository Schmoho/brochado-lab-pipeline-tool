{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents P40 nucleoproteins from several Borna disease virus (BDV) strains. BDV is an RNA virus that is a member of the Mononegavirales family, which includes such members as Measles virus and Ebola virus sp.. BDV causes an infection of the central nervous system in a wide range of vertebrates, which can progress to an often fatal immune-mediated disease. Viral nucleoproteins are central to transcription, replication, and packaging of the RNA genome. P40 nucleoprotein from BDV is multi-helical in structure and can be divided into two subdomains, each of which has an Î±-bundle topology [[cite:PUB00012372]]. The nucleoprotein assembles into a planar homotetramer, with the RNA genome either wrapping around the outside of the tetramer or possibly fitting within the charged central channel of the tetramer [[cite:PUB00029014]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1n93", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Borna Disease Virus Nucleoprotein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036260", "name" "P40 nucleoprotein superfamily, Borna disease virus", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015969", "name" "P40 nucleoprotein, subdomain 1, Borna disease virus", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015970", "name" "P40 nucleoprotein, subdomain 2, Borna disease virus", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06407" "Borna disease virus P40 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "P40 nucleoprotein, Borna disease virus", "short" "P40_nucleoprot_BD-vir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 62, "taxa" 380, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 548, "sets" 0, "proteins" 546, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 49}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009441", :literature {"PUB00012372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Planz O" "Stitz L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
