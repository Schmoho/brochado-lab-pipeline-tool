{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, negatively supercoils DNA and is essential for the survival of bacterial cells. This entry represents GyrI, a protein which inhibits the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase [[cite:PUB00056797]]. The mechanism of this inhibition is not known, but it occurs either before or during DNA binding by the gyrase [[cite:PUB00056798]]. GyrI protects cells from the double-strand DNA breaks produced by gyrase inhibitors, such as quinolones, that act by trapping the gyrase-DNA covalent complex. It does not appear to protect against inhibitors that target ATPase activity. GyrI has also been shown to protect cells against alkylating agents that act independently of DNA gyrase, suggesting a more general role in protecting cells against DNA damage [[cite:PUB00056799]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jyh", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Escherichia coli SbmC protein (AKA Gyrase Inhibitory Protein GyrI, AKA YeeB)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011256", "name" "Regulatory factor, effector binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01896" "DNA gyrase inhibitor [sbmC]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA gyrase inhibitor GyrI", "short" "DNA_gyrase_inhibitor_GyrI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 61, "taxa" 831, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1004, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1004, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 759}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024911", :literature {"PUB00056797" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Nakanishi A" "Oshida T" "Matsushita T" "Imajoh-Ohmi S" "Ohnuki T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
