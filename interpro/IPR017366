{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a histone demethylase (LSD1) that specifically demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation, thereby acting as a co-repressor [[cite:PUB00044642], [cite:PUB00101353]]. This enzyme acts by oxidising the substrate by FAD to generate the corresponding imine, which is subsequently hydrolysed. This enzyme demethylates both mono- and di-methylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 and may play a role in the repression of neuronal genes. Alone, it is unable to demethylate H3 'Lys-4' on nucleosomes and requires the presence of RCOR1/CoREST to achieve such activity. It may also demethylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression, thereby leading to derepression of androgen receptor target genes. It plays a role in developmental growth and lifespan regulation in response to ultraviolet-induced damage [[cite:PUB00101353]].</p>\n\n<p>This histone demethylase is a component of a BHC histone deacetylase complex that contains HDAC1, HDAC2, HMG20B/BRAF35, AOF2/LSD1, RCOR1/CoREST and PHF21A/BHC80 [[cite:PUB00044643]]. The BHC complex may also contain ZMYM2, ZNF217, ZMYM3, GSE1 and GTF2I. In the complex, RCOR1/CoREST strongly enhances the demethylase activity and protects it from the proteasome while PHF21A/BHC80 inhibits the demethylase activity. Interacts with the androgen receptor (AR).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038051" "Lysine-specific histone demethylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysine-specific histone demethylase", "short" "Hist_Lys-spec_deMease"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 101, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 716, "taxa" 3013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1992, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1752, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1093}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
