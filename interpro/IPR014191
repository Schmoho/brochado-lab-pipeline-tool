{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this entry represent a set of proteins related to, yet architecturally different from, the activating protein for the glycine radical-containing, oxygen-sensitive ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (RNR, see [interpro:IPR012837]). Members of this entry are found paired with members of a similarly divergent set of anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductases. Identification of these proteins as RNR activating proteins is partly from pairing with the candidate RNR and further supported by the finding that upstream of these operons are examples of a conserved regulatory element that is found in nearly all bacteria and that occurs specifically upstream of operons for all three classes of RNR genes [[cite:PUB00020982]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02826" "anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase activating protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase activator", "short" "Anaer_RNR_activator"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 150, "taxa" 801, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 636, "sets" 0, "proteins" 636, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 489}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0291", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0291"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014191", :literature {"PUB00020982" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Rodionov DA" "Gelfand MS."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2005.05.011", "medline_journal" "Trends Genet", "title" "Identification of a bacterial regulatory system for ribonucleotide reductases by phylogenetic profiling.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "385-9", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15949864}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014191", "name" "Anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase activator", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
