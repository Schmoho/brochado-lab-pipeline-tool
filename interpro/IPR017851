{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochromes c (cytC) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes.</p>\n\n<p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC. Class 1 cytochromes have the haem-attachment site towards the N terminus, and can be further subdivided into five groups (1A to 1E) based on sequence similarity. Cytochrome C550 (CytC550) is a class 1A cytochrome. CytC550 (also known as Photosystem II extrinsic protein V, PsbV) is an extrinsic membrane protein that forms part of the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II, this complex being responsible for the splitting of water into O(2) and 4H+, the latter being used to reduce CO2 to glucose. CytC550 is only found in cyanobacteria and red algae [[cite:PUB00015381]], this protein having been lost during the evolution of green plants [[cite:PUB00015369]]. Other Class 1A cytochrome C proteins include mitochondrial cytochrome C, which acts as an electron carrier between cytochrome reductase and the cytochrome oxidase complex, the final electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain; and cytochrome C6, which acts as an electron carrier between cytochrome b6f and photosystem I in cyanobacteria [[cite:PUB00015382]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mz4", "name" "Crystal Structure of Cytochrome c550 from Thermosynechococcus elongatus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01378" "Photosystem II extrinsic protein V [psbV]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03045" "photosystem II cytochrome c-550"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem II extrinsic protein V, cytochrome c-550 precursor", "short" "PsbV_cyt_c550"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 121, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 213, "taxa" 2225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1210, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1209, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 899}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0661", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0661"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017851", :literature {"PUB00000610" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ambler RP."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
