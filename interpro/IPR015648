{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The DP proteins function as binding partners for E2F transcription factors. The association of DP with E2F can either enhances or repress E2F-dependent transcriptional activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The activities of both DP and E2F proteins are under cell cycle control, being influenced by the level of phosphorylation imparted through the cell cycle regulated activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Molecules that function to positively regulate the G1/S transition, such as cyclin-cdk complexes, and negatively regulate it, such as the cdk inhibitors, converge on the Rb pathway. A principal role of pRb is in the regulation of the E2F/DP transcription factors, activity of which determines cell-cycle progression [[cite:PUB00035117], [cite:PUB00035118]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both DP and E2F proteins are endowed with proto-oncogenic activity and, conversely, have been implicated in regulating apoptosis [[cite:PUB00035119]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DP proteins have been widely evolutionarily conserved and can be found in organisms ranging from Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) to Homo sapiens (Human).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038168", "name" "Transcription factor DP, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF009404" "Transcription factor DP"}, "panther" {"PTHR12548" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR DP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor DP", "short" "Transcrpt_fac_DP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1491, "taxa" 5890, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5360, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5260, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3418}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015648", :literature {"PUB00035117" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["La Thangue NB."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
