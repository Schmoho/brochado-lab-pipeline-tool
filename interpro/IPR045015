{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) from Arabidopsis. AN is related to C-terminal binding protein/brefeldin A ADP-ribosylated substrate (CtBP/BARS) with an important role in animal development. It plays a major role in microtubule-dependent cell morphogenesis. The phenotype of the AN mutants include narrow cotyledons, narrow rosette leaves, twisted seed pods (siliques) and less-branched trichome. Moreover, it has been shown to be involved in a wide range of biological processes, including facilitating both abiotic and biotic stress tolerance through ROS-mediated redox activity [[cite:PUB00097717]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43254" "C-TERMINAL BINDING PROTEIN AN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-terminal binding protein AN-like", "short" "AN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 238, "taxa" 969, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 794, "sets" 0, "proteins" 794, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 463}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045015", :literature {"PUB00097717" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Gachomo EW" "Jimenez-Lopez JC" "Smith SR" "Cooksey AB" "Oghoghomeh OM" "Johnson N" "Baba-Moussa L" "Kotchoni SO."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "title" "The cell morphogenesis ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) gene, a plant homolog of CtBP/BARS, is involved in abiotic and biotic stress response in higher plants.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "79", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23672620}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000226", "name" "microtubule cytoskeleton organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045015", "name" "C-terminal binding protein AN-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
