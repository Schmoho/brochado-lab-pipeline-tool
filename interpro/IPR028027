{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family (previously DUF4542) represents the homologs of Sperm microtubule associated protein 1 (SPMAP1 also known as C17orf98). These proteins contain a conserved IPPYN sequence motif. The EM structure of sperm DMTs shows that SPMAP1 interacts directly with the tubulin lattice at the A-tubule seam (between protofilaments A09/A10) where outer dense fibers (ODFs) are connected to dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) [[cite:PUB00151496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34221" "HYPOTHETICAL PROTEIN LOC691189"}, "pfam" {"PF15075" "Sperm microtubule associated protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sperm microtubule associated protein 1", "short" "SPMAP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 259, "taxa" 1060, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 466, "sets" 0, "proteins" 439, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 269}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028027", :literature {"PUB00151496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Leung MR" "Zeng J" "Wang X" "Roelofs MC" "Huang W" "Zenezini Chiozzi R" "Hevler JF" "Heck AJR" "Dutcher SK" "Brown A" "Zhang R" "Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.05.026", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural specializations of the sperm tail.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2880-2896.e17", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37327785}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR028027", "name" "Sperm microtubule associated protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 321}}}
