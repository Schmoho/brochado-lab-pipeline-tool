{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a predicted cell-wall amidase, LytH type. LytH (YunA) has been identified as a sporulation-specific part of the cortex structure. The lytH gene is only expressed during sporulation and is controlled by the mother cell-specific sigma factor sigma(K). lytH encodes an L-Ala-D-Glu peptidase involved in production of single L-alanine side chains from tetrapeptides in the spore cortex [[cite:PUB00044107]]. Deficiency in the lytH gene causes an elevation of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, strain SR17238, a strain of S. aureus with a low level of resistance to methicillin [[cite:PUB00044108]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037730" "Predicted cell-wall amidase, LytH type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable cell wall amidase LytH", "short" "LytH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 165, "sets" 0, "proteins" 165, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 115}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
