{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peter Pan (PPAN) was initially identified in Drosophila melanogaster. PPAN is highly conserved and essential for maintaining growth and survival [[cite:PUB00098059]]. Human PPAN localizes to nucleoli and to mitochondria. It can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in response to nucleolar stress and apoptosis induction [[cite:PUB00098058]]. PPAN knockdown has been linked to mitochondrial damage and stimulates autophagy [[cite:PUB00098060]]. The yeast homologues of PPAN, Ssf1 and Ssf2, are nucleolar ribosome biogenesis factors required for maturation of the large ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00060567]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12661" "PETER PAN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein Peter Pan-like", "short" "PPAN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2435, "taxa" 8491, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4489, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4489, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2877}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045112", :literature {"PUB00060567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bogengruber E" "Briza P" "Doppler E" "Wimmer H" "Koller L" "Fasiolo F" "Senger B" "Hegemann JH" "Breitenbach M."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Yeast Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1567-1356(02)00193-9", "medline_journal" "FEMS Yeast Res", "title" "Functional analysis in yeast of the Brix protein superfamily involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "35-43", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12702244}, "PUB00098058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Pfister AS" "Keil M" "Kuhl M."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The Wnt Target Protein Peter Pan Defines a Novel p53-independent Nucleolar Stress-Response Pathway.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "10905-18", "volume" "290", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25759387}, "PUB00098059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Migeon JC" "Garfinkel MS" "Edgar BA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "Cloning and characterization of peter pan, a novel Drosophila gene required for larval growth.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1733-44", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10359593}, "PUB00098060" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Dannheisig DP" "Beck E" "Calzia E" "Walther P" "Behrends C" "Pfister AS."], "ISO_journal" "Cells", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cells", "title" "Loss of Peter Pan (PPAN) Affects Mitochondrial Homeostasis and Autophagic Flux.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31416196}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045112", "name" "Protein Peter Pan-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
