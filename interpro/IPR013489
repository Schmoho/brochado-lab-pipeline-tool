{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Csm6 family of Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins [[cite:PUB00020781]] found in bacteria, such as Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066, Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strains CDC1551 and H37Rv), as part of Mtube-type CRISPR/Cas systems, now called type III-A. Csm6 is a CARF (CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold) superfamily protein, that acts as a standalone RNase that degrades invader RNA transcripts after allosteric activation by cyclic oligoadenylates (cOA), which are produced by Cas10 subunit in the interference complex upon target RNA binding. These cOA bind to Csm6's CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain [[cite:PUB00085051], [cite:PUB00106904]]. CRISPR is a widespread form of direct repeat found in archaea and bacteria, with distinctive subtypes each of which has a characteristic sporadic distribution [[cite:PUB00043286]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8pe3", "name" "Structure of Csm6' from Streptococcus thermophilus in complex with cyclic hexa-adenylate (cA6)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02672" "type III-A CRISPR-associated CARF protein Csm6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CRISPR-associated protein Csm6", "short" "CRISPR-assoc_prot_Csm6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 491, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 362, "sets" 0, "proteins" 362, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 272}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0021", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0021"} {"accession" "GenProp0318", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0318"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013489", :literature {"PUB00085051" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Makarova KS" "Anantharaman V" "Grishin NV" "Koonin EV" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Front Genet", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2014.00102", "medline_journal" "Front Genet", "title" "CARF and WYL domains: ligand-binding regulators of prokaryotic defense systems.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "102", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24817877}, "PUB00106904" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7669", "authors" ["Niewoehner O" "Garcia-Doval C" "Rostol JT" "Berk C" "Schwede F" "Bigler L" "Hall J" "Marraffini LA" "Jinek M."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Type III CRISPR-Cas systems produce cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "543-548", "volume" "548", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28722012}, "PUB00020781" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Selengut J" "Mongodin EF" "Nelson KE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Comput.
