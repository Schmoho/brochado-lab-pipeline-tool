{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>WhiB is a putative transcription factor in Actinobacteria, required for differentiation and sporulation. The process of mycelium formation in Streptomyces, which occurs in response to nutrient limitation, is controlled by a number of whi genes, named for the white colour of aerial hyphae when mutations occur in these genes. The normal colour is grey. The exact role of WhiB is not clear, but a mutation in the gene results in white, tightly coiled aerial hyphae [[cite:PUB00020553]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8cwt", "name" "Complex structure of WhiB3 and the SigmaAr4-RNAP Beta flap tip chimera in space group P43212"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38839" "TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATOR WHID-RELATED"}, "hamap" {"MF_01479" "Transcriptional regulator WhiB [whiB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor WhiB", "short" "Whib"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2194, "taxa" 7043, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31838, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31838, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23500}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003482", :literature {"PUB00020553" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kormanec J" "Homerova D."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/21.10.2512", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Streptomyces aureofaciens whiB gene encoding putative transcription factor essential for differentiation.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "2512", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8506145}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003482", "name" "Transcription factor WhiB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
