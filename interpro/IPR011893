{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Rdx family of selenoproteins, which includes mammalian selenoproteins SelW, SelV, SelT and SelH, bacterial SelW-like proteins and cysteine-containing proteins of unknown function in all three domains of life. Mammalian Rdx12 and its fish selenoprotein orthologues are also members of this family [[cite:PUB00053376]]. These proteins possess a thioredoxin-like fold and a conserved CXXC or CxxU (U is selenocysteine) motif near the N terminus, suggesting a redox function. Rdx proteins can use catalytic cysteine (or selenocysteine) to form transient mixed disulphides with substrate proteins. Selenium (Se) plays an essential role in cell survival and most of the effects of Se are probably mediated by selenoproteins.</p>\n\n<p>Selenoprotein W (SelW) plays an important role in protection of neurons from oxidative stress during neuronal development [[cite:PUB00053377], [cite:PUB00010227]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2fa8", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Putative Selenoprotein W-related family Protein from Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10262" "Rdx family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02174" "SelT/SelW/SelH domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenoprotein, Rdx-type", "short" "Selenoprotein_Rdx-typ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 95, "proteomes" 3929, "taxa" 15523, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14567, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10152}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
