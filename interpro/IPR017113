{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The IncW plasmid pSa contains the gene ard, which encodes an antirestriction protein that is specific for type I restriction and modification systems [[cite:PUB00043496]]. The protein has no significant similarities with other known Ard proteins (ArdA and ArdB types) except for the \"antirestriction\" motif (14 amino acid residues in length). This is conserved in all known Ard proteins. ArdC does, however, have a high degree of similarity (about 38% identity) to the N-terminal region of RP4 TraC1 primase, which includes about 300 amino acid residues and seems essential for binding to single-stranded DNA, as well as TraC1 transport to the recipient cells during the transfer of plasmid DNA. ArdC also binds to single-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00043496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6i89", "name" "Crystal structure of Antirestriction ArdC protein from R388 plasmid.
