{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycosyltransferase 64 (GT64) is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) and is thought to be essential for cell-cell adhesion, organ integrity, and metabolite movement in plants [[cite:PUB00072935]]. Members of the family, such as Glycosylinositol phosphorylceramide mannosyl transferase 1, function as mannosyl transferases (ManT) [[cite:PUB00155269]] and are implicated in the prevention of abscisic acid-mediated developmental effects, including aspects like cell size, flowering time, and senescence [[cite:PUB00155270]]. GT64 is also likely involved in the biosynthesis of beta-(1,4)-galactan, contributing to cell-wall synthesis and thus playing a critical role in plant development and structural stability [[cite:PUB00155269], [cite:PUB00155268]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48410" "GLYCOSYLINOSITOL PHOSPHORYLCERAMIDE MANNOSYL TRANSFERASE 1", "PTHR48409" "GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE FAMILY PROTEIN 64 C3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyltransferase 64", "short" "GT64"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 257, "taxa" 1046, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1158, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1158, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 675}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
