{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sulphite reductases (SiRs) and related nitrite reductases (NiRs) catalyse the six-electron reduction reactions of sulphite to sulphide, and nitrite to ammonia, respectively. The Escherichia coli SiR enzyme is a complex composed of two proteins, a flavoprotein alpha-component (SiR-FP) and a hemoprotein beta-component (SiR-HP), and has an α(8)β(4) quaternary structure [[cite:PUB00014351]]. SiR-FP contains both FAD and FMN, while SiR-HP contains a Fe(4)S(4) cluster coupled to a sirohaem through a cysteine bridge. Electrons are transferred from NADPH to FAD, and on to FMN in SiR-FP, from which they are transferred to the metal centre of SiR-HP, where they reduce the siroheme-bound sulphite.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1aop", "name" "SULFITE REDUCTASE STRUCTURE AT 1.6 ANGSTROM RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11493" "SULFITE REDUCTASE [NADPH] SUBUNIT BETA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrite and sulphite reductase 4Fe-4S domain containing protein", "short" "NO2/SO3_Rdtase_4Fe4S_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 34, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3960, "taxa" 16326, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19060, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19060, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13629}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
