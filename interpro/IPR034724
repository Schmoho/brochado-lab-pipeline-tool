{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) from animals.  CHD8 regulates transcription. It acts as a repressor in several pathways: repressing transcription by remodeling chromatin structure (binding to histone H3 di- and trimethylated on Lys4) and recruiting histone H1 to target genes [[cite:PUB00084223]]; suppressing p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by recruiting histone H1 and preventing p53/TP53 transactivation activity [[cite:PUB00084225]]; and a negative regulator of Wnt signaling pathway, regulating beta-catenin activity [[cite:PUB00084224]].  By interacting with CTCF, it is involved in epigenetic remodeling [[cite:PUB00036133]].  CHD8 can also act as a transcription activator, participating in efficient U6 RNA polymerase III transcription by interacting with ZNF143.  Gene knockout is embryonically lethal [[cite:PUB00084225]]. CHD8 has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [[cite:PUB00084305]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03071" "Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 8 [CHD8]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 8", "short" "CHD8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 217, "taxa" 913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 521, "sets" 0, "proteins" 521, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
