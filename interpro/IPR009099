{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The beta-lactamase-inhibitor protein (BLIP) is produced by Streptomyces species. BLIP acts as a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases such as TEM-1, which is the most widespread resistance enzyme to penicillin antibiotics. BLIP binds competitively to TEM-1 and makes direct contacts with TEM-1 active site residues. BLIP is able to inhibit a variety of class A beta-lactamases, possibly through flexibility of its two domains. The two tandemly repeated domains of BLIP have an α(2)-β(4) structure, the β-hairpin loop from domain 1 inserting into the active site of beta-lactamase [[cite:PUB00013170]]. BLIP shows no sequence similarity with BLIP-II, even though both bind to and inhibit TEM-1 [[cite:PUB00013255]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3gmv", "name" "Crystal Structure of Beta-Lactamse Inhibitory Protein-I (BLIP-I) in Apo Form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024221", "name" "Beta-lactamase-inhibitor protein BLIP domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07467" "Beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLIP)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009292" "Beta-lactamase inhibitory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-lactamase-inhibitor protein BLIP", "short" "Beta-lactamas_inhib"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 138, "sets" 0, "proteins" 122, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 86}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009099", :literature {"PUB00013170" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Strynadka NC" "Jensen SE" "Alzari PM" "James MN."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
