{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Minor capsid protein VP2 from Caliciviruses. VP2 is a minor structural protein that forms a portal-like structure at a unique three-fold axis of symmetry, following binding to the host receptor [[cite:PUB00097361]]. This structure contains twelve copies of VP2, arranged with their hydrophobic N termini pointing away from the virion surface. VP2 is known to be essential for productive replication that results in the synthesis and maturation of infectious virions and thus critical for the production of infectious virus [[cite:PUB00153756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Caliciviruses are a small round-structured virus group defined by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and capsid diversity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03035" "Calicivirus putative RNA polymerase/capsid protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Minor capsid protein VP2", "short" "VP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 1699, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3865, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2846, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004278", :literature {"PUB00097361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7739", "authors" ["Conley MJ" "McElwee M" "Azmi L" "Gabrielsen M" "Byron O" "Goodfellow IG" "Bhella D."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Calicivirus VP2 forms a portal-like assembly following receptor engagement.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "377-381", "volume" "565", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30626974}, "PUB00153756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Sosnovtsev SV" "Belliot G" "Chang KO" "Onwudiwe O" "Green KY."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.79.7.4012-4024.2005", "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Feline calicivirus VP2 is essential for the production of infectious virions.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "4012-24", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15767403}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004278", "name" "Minor capsid protein VP2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 34, "alignment:full" 1}}}
