The signal for entry into this pathway is monoubiquitination of protein cargo, which results in incorporation of cargo into luminal vesicles at late endosomes. Another crucial player is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdINS(3)P), which is enriched on early endosomes and on the luminal vesicles of MVBs. ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-I, -II and -III complexes are critical for MVB budding and sorting of monoubiquitinated cargo into the luminal vesicles [[cite:PUB00087727]].
