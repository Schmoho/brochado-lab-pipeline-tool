The reaction requires two bound magnesium ions for the catalysis and is activated by monovalent cations such as potassium and ammonium. The enzyme is a tetramer of identical subunits; each monomer is composed of an N- and a C-terminal domain that adopt nearly superimposible structures, suggesting that the protein has arisen by gene duplication [[cite:PUB00049158]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qv6", "name" "GTP cyclohydrolase III from M. jannaschii (MJ0145) complexed with GTP and metal ions"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42202" "GTP CYCLOHYDROLASE III"}, "hamap" {"MF_00608" "GTP cyclohydrolase III [gch3]"}, "pfam" {"PF05165" "GTP cyclohydrolase III"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009265" "GTP cyclohydrolase 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GTP cyclohydrolase III", "short" "GTP_CycHdrlase_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 240, "taxa" 1291, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1149, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 999}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
