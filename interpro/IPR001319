{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nuclear transition protein 1 (TP1) is one of the spermatid-specific proteins [[cite:PUB00001393]]. TP1 is a basic protein well conserved in mammalian species. In mammals, the second stage of spermatogenesis is characterised by the conversion of nucleosomal chromatin to the compact, non-nucleosomal and transcriptionally inactive form found in the sperm nucleus. This condensation is associated with a double-protein transition. The first transition corresponds to the replacement of histones by several spermatid-specific proteins (also called transition proteins) which are themselves replaced by protamines during the second transition.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17486" "SPERMATID NUCLEAR TRANSITION PROTEIN 1"}, "pfam" {"PF02079" "Nuclear transition protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear transition protein 1", "short" "Nuclear_transition_prot1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 109, "taxa" 448, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 152, "sets" 0, "proteins" 152, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 105}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00467", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00467"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001319", :literature {"PUB00001393" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chirat F" "Martinage A" "Briand G" "Kouach M" "Van Dorsselaer A" "Loir M" "Sautiere P."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
