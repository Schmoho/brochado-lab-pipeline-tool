{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chlorosomes, which are attached to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, consist of four polypeptides and associated pigments and lipids. The principal light-harvesting pigment of the green filamentous bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus is bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) c. This pigment is either bound to, or constrained by, a small approximately 80-residue polypeptide designated Bchlc-binding protein. In C. aurantiacus, a C-terminal extension is believed to play a role in proper incorporation of the protein during chlorosome assembly [[cite:PUB00002115]]. The protein has a high degree of similarity to Bchlc-binding proteins of other photosynthetic bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038387", "name" "Bacteriochlorophyll c-binding superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002903" "Chlorosome protein, CsmA/CsmE types"}, "prints" {"PR00656" "BCHLROPHYLLC"}, "pfam" {"PF02043" "Bacteriochlorophyll C binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriochlorophyll c-binding protein", "short" "Bchl_c-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 105, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 131, "sets" 0, "proteins" 131, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001470", :literature {"PUB00002115" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Theroux SJ" "Redlinger TE" "Fuller RC" "Robinson SJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
