{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins that form part of the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) from Legionellales, including YlfA/LegC7 ([swissprot:Q5ZT67]) and YlfB/LegC2 ([swissprot:Q5ZUC3]), which were initially identified in a screen for proteins that cause growth inhibition in yeast and functionally mimic glutamine (Q)-SNARE proteins. Members of this family are probably membrane-associated effectors that enhance remodeling of the bacteria-containing vacuole by promoting association and possibly fusion of ER-derived membrane vesicles [[cite:PUB00153636], [cite:PUB00153637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043058" "LegC2/C7 family Dot/Icm T4SS effector"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dot/Icm T4SS effector LegC2/C7", "short" "T4SS_LegC2C7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 60, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 110, "sets" 0, "proteins" 110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 90}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049966", :literature {"PUB00153636" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Campodonico EM" "Roy CR" "Ninio S."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159698", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Legionella pneumophila Type IV Effectors YlfA and YlfB Are SNARE-Like Proteins that Form Homo- and Heteromeric Complexes and Enhance the Efficiency of Vacuole Remodeling.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0159698", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27459495}, "PUB00153637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Shi X" "Halder P" "Yavuz H" "Jahn R" "Shuman HA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1608755113", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Direct targeting of membrane fusion by SNARE mimicry: Convergent evolution of Legionella effectors.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "8807-12", "volume" "113", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27436892}, "PUB00153433" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["de Felipe KS" "Glover RT" "Charpentier X" "Anderson OR" "Reyes M" "Pericone CD" "Shuman HA."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000117", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Legionella eukaryotic-like type IV substrates interfere with organelle trafficking.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "e1000117", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18670632}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049966", "name" "Dot/Icm T4SS effector LegC2/C7", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
