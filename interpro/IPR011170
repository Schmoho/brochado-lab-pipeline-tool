{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Virus-encoded growth factors (GF) are important for the virulence of poxviruses. They act to promote the growth of their host cell through their binding to host ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases, which in turn activate the MAPK pathway. These growth factors are related to mammalian epidermal growth factor (EGF), one of several host ErbB ligands. The viral GFs are potent mitogens, acting to prevent host receptor degradation and ubiquitination, which leads to sustained signal transduction. Growth factors from different poxviruses display unique patterns of specificity to host ErbB receptors: VGF (vaccinia virus GF) binds primarily to ErbB-1 homodimers, MGF (myxoma virus GF) binds to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers, and SFGF (Shope fibroma virus GF) binds to different ErbB receptors [[cite:PUB00014750]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001779" "Growth factor, vaccinia C11R type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Growth factor, vaccinia C11R type", "short" "GF_C11R"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 53, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 98, "sets" 0, "proteins" 98, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011170", :literature {"PUB00014750" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Tzahar E" "Moyer JD" "Waterman H" "Barbacci EG" "Bao J" "Levkowitz G" "Shelly M" "Strano S" "Pinkas-Kramarski R" "Pierce JH" "Andrews GC" "Yarden Y."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/17.20.5948", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Pathogenic poxviruses reveal viral strategies to exploit the ErbB signaling network.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "5948-63", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9774339}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005154", "name" "epidermal growth factor receptor binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007176", "name" "regulation of epidermal growth factor-activated receptor activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR011170", "name" "Growth factor, vaccinia C11R type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
