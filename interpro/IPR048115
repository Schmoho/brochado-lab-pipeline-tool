{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the GspL subunit of a rare variant form of type II secretion system (T2SS) found exclusively in the Synergistota, with the SYNERG-CTERM protein-sorting system. SYNERG-CTERM is a C-terminal sorting signal with an invariant Cys residue in its signature domain. The sorting enzyme for SYNERG-CTERM proteins, MrtS (myxosortase S), is a homologue of the MYXO-CTERM-processing enzyme MrtX and of the eukaryotic CAAX prenyl protease Rce1. SYNERG-CTERM proteins are predicted to become surface-anchored by a lipid group attached to a C-terminal Cys sidechain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041617" "type II secretion system protein GspL, SYNERG-CTERM-associated variant"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II secretion system protein GspL-like, Synergistales", "short" "T2SS_GspL_synerg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 45, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048115", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048115", "name" "Type II secretion system protein GspL-like, Synergistales", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
