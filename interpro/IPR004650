Proteins are homologous to phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide isomerase (HisA) and, with lower similarity, to the cyclase HisF, both of which are enzymes of histidine biosynthesis. Each species with this protein also encodes HisA. However, the function of proteins in this group is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00734" "HisA/HisF family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HisA/HisF-like protein, archaeal", "short" "HisA/F-archaeal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 162, "sets" 0, "proteins" 162, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 143}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004650", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006062", "name" "Histidine biosynthesis protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004650", "name" "HisA/HisF-like protein, archaeal", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004651", "name" "Histidine biosynthesis, HisF", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044524", "name" "Histidine biosynthesis, HisA-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011858", "name" "His6-like, eukaryotic-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023016", "name" "HisA/PriA, bacterial-type", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006063", "name" "HisA, bacterial-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010188", "name" "HisA/PriA, Actinobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
