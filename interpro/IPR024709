{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant-specific O-fucosyltransferases and their homologues [[cite:PUB00075507]]. O-fucosyltransferase-like proteins are GDP-fucose dependent enzymes with similarities to the family 1 glycosyltransferases (GT1). They are soluble ER proteins that may be proteolytically cleaved from a membrane-associated preprotein, and are involved in the O-fucosylation of protein substrates, the core fucosylation of growth factor receptors, and other processes [[cite:PUB00085844], [cite:PUB00085845]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11299" "GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase, plant specific subfamily"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009360" "Uncharacterised conserved protein with GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR31288" "O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE FAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative O-fucosyltransferase, plant", "short" "FucosylTrfase_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 269, "taxa" 1102, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16045, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15337, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9211}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
