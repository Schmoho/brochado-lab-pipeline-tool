The celA gene product is a polypeptide of 1751 amino acids; this has a multidomain structure comprising two catalytic domains and two cellulose-binding domains, linked by Pro-Thr-rich regions. The N-terminal domain encodes an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose, consistent with its similarity to several endo-1, 4-beta-D-glucanase sequences. The C-terminal domain shows similarity to a cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum (CelS), which acts synergistically with a second component to hydrolyse crystalline cellulose [[cite:PUB00000145]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4jjj", "name" "The structure of T. fusca GH48 D224N mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012341", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008928", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027390", "name" "Endoglucanase F, domain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023309", "name" "Endoglucanase F, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02011" "Glycosyl hydrolase family 48"}, "prints" {"PR00844" "GLHYDRLASE48"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, 48F", "short" "Glyco_hydro_48F"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 65, "proteomes" 573, "taxa" 1945, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2563, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2399, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1894}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GH48", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GH48.html"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
