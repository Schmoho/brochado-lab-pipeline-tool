{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RELMs, secreted proteins with roles including insulin resistance and the activation of inflammatory processes, are also known as found in inflammatory zone (FIZZ), and include four members in mouse (RELM-alpha/FIZZ1/HIMF, RELM-beta/FIZZ2, Resistin/FIZZ3, and RELM-gamma/FIZZ4) and two members in human (resistin and RELM-beta). RELMs are potentially implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including obesity-associated diabetes, cardiovascular system function, cancer development and metastasis [[cite:PUB00094728], [cite:PUB00094721], [cite:PUB00094729], [cite:PUB00094731]].</p>\n\n<p>There are significant differences between human and rodent RELMs with respect to gene and protein structure, differential gene regulation, different tissue distribution profiles, and insulin resistance induction. Resistin appears to convey insulin resistance in rodents, and to instigate inflammatory processes in humans. In the pathophysiology of obesity-associated diabetes, mouse resistin is secreted by adipocytes and increases hepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby promoting insulin resistance, human resistin is secreted by macrophages and may play a role through inflammatory contributions [[cite:PUB00094726], [cite:PUB00094724]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rgx", "name" "Crystal Structure of resisitin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036262", "name" "Resistin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16333" "resistin-like molecule (RELM) hormone family"}, "pfam" {"PF06954" "Resistin"}, "panther" {"PTHR21101" "RESISTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Resistin-like molecule hormone family", "short" "RELM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 175, "taxa" 699, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 548, "sets" 0, "proteins" 544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 295}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009714", :literature {"PUB00094721" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Abate N" "Sallam HS" "Rizzo M" "Nikolic D" "Obradovic M" "Bjelogrlic P" "Isenovic ER."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
