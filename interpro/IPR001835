{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin is a bacterial protein toxin with an AB5 multimer structure, in which the B pentamer has a membrane-binding function and the A chain ([interpro:IPR001144]) is needed for enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00003304]]. The B subunits are arranged as a donut-shaped pentamer, each subunit participating in ~30 hydrogen bonds and 6 salt bridges with its two neighbours [[cite:PUB00003304]].</p>\r\n<p>The A subunit has a less well-defined secondary structure. It predominantly interacts with the pentamer via the C-terminal A2 fragment, which runs through the charged central pore of the B subunits. A putative catalytic residue in the A1 fragment (Glu112) lies close to a hydrophobic region, which packs two loops together. It is thought that this region might be important for catalysis and membrane translocation [[cite:PUB00003304]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5elb", "name" "Cholera toxin classical B-pentamer in complex with Lewis-y"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008992", "name" "Enterotoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01376" "Heat-labile enterotoxin beta chain"}, "prints" {"PR00772" "ENTEROTOXINB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heat-labile enterotoxin, B chain", "short" "Enterotoxin_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 66, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 62, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 138, "sets" 0, "proteins" 137, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 122}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001835", :literature {"PUB00003304" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sixma TK" "Kalk KH" "van Zanten BA" "Dauter Z" "Kingma J" "Witholt B" "Hol WG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
