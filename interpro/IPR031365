{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes human protein C2orf73 (also known as Ciliary microtubule inner protein 6, CMIP6) and homologues. CMIP6 is a close homologue of C. reinhardtii FAP363. FAP363 contains Mn repeats that make close contacts with the luminal microtubule lattice. Proteins in this family are found in eukaryotes. They are typically between 135 and 289 amino acids in length, with three conserved sequence motifs: GDWWSH, RSDF and KRHG.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15667" "Protein of unknown function with motif GDWWSH"}, "panther" {"PTHR35087" "SIMILAR TO HYPOTHETICAL PROTEIN FLJ40298"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ciliary microtubule inner protein 6", "short" "CMIP6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 265, "taxa" 1150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 456, "sets" 0, "proteins" 445, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 264}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031365", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031365", "name" "Ciliary microtubule inner protein 6", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 302}}}
