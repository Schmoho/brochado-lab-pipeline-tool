{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ubiquitin-fold proteins are an important class of eukaryotic post-translational modifiers [[cite:PUB00043569], [cite:PUB00043568]]. They are generally short proteins (less than 200 amino acids) which contain the core Î²-grasp fold (also known as the ubiquitin fold) and a C-terminal extension which enables their attachment to other proteins through the terminal carboxyl group. Protein-conjugated ubiquitins have been implicated an a wide variety of cellular process including proteolysis, DNA repair, transcription and autophagy Some ubiquitin-like proteins are not conjugated to proteins, but are instead anchored to the cell membrane by attachment to phospholipids or isoprenes. The functions of these membrane-associated proteins are not generally well understood. In the case of isoprene attachemnet, the prenyl group may also play a role in enhancing protein-protein interactions.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a group of membrane-associated ubiquitin-fold proteins found in plants and animals [[cite:PUB00043568]]. In Arabidopsis, membrane-anchored ubiquitin-fold (MUB) proteins recruit and dock specific E2s to the plasma membrane. They appear to interact noncovalently with an E2 surface opposite the active site that forms a covalent linkage with Ub [[cite:PUB00076959]]. The animal homologues of MUBs, also known as UBL3, have also been identified as ubiquitin-like proteins [[cite:PUB00076960]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029071", "name" "Ubiquitin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF032572" "Membrane-anchored ubiquitin-fold protein, HCG-1 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane-anchored ubiquitin-fold protein", "short" "MUB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 877, "taxa" 3469, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2849, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2826, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1867}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017000", :literature {"PUB00076960" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Chadwick BP" "Kidd T" "Sgouros J" "Ish-Horowicz D" "Frischauf AM."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(99)00138-9", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Cloning, mapping and expression of UBL3, a novel ubiquitin-like gene.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "189-95", "volume" "233", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10375635}, "PUB00043568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "37", "authors" ["Downes BP" "Saracco SA" "Lee SS" "Crowell DN" "Vierstra RD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
