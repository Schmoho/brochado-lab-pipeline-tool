{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents lipid A 1-diphosphate synthase LpxT (also known as YeiU) from Enterobacteriaceae. It is involved in the modification of the lipid A domain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is part of Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane. Variation of the lipid A domain of LPS serves to promote bacterial resistance [[cite:PUB00077024]]. LpxT transfers a phosphate group from undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP) to lipid A to form lipid A 1-diphosphate and contributes to the recycling of undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) [[cite:PUB00077017]]. It also has low undecaprenyl-diphosphate phosphatase activity<i>in vitro</i> [[cite:PUB00077018]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036938", "name" "Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2/haloperoxidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01945" "Lipid A 1-diphosphate synthase [lpxT]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid A 1-diphosphate synthase", "short" "LpxT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 100, "taxa" 1062, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1253, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1253, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 955}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
