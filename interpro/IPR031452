{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Killer toxin-resistance protein 1 (kre1) is a GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein. It is involved in the late stage of cell wall 1,6-beta-glucan synthesis and assembly [[cite:PUB00075855]]. Its function in yeast cell wall assembly is structural, rather than enzymatic. It can also act as a plasma membrane receptor for the yeast K1 viral toxin, and is involved in subsequent lethal channel formation [[cite:PUB00075856]]. This entry also includes Pga1 protein, which has a role in oxidative stress response and is required for normal adhesion to host cells and for adherence during biofilm formation [[cite:PUB00075857]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17056" "Killer toxin-resistance protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein Kre1", "short" "Kre1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 212, "taxa" 685, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 417, "sets" 0, "proteins" 417, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 297}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031452", :literature {"PUB00075855" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 10", "authors" ["Breinig F" "Schleinkofer K" "Schmitt MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.27175-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Yeast Kre1p is GPI-anchored and involved in both cell wall assembly and architecture.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "3209-18", "volume" "150", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15470101}, "PUB00075856" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Breinig F" "Tipper DJ" "Schmitt MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00634-7", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Kre1p, the plasma membrane receptor for the yeast K1 viral toxin.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "395-405", "volume" "108", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11853673}, "PUB00075857" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hashash R" "Younes S" "Bahnan W" "El Koussa J" "Maalouf K" "Dimassi HI" "Khalaf RA."], "ISO_journal" "Mycoses", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0507.2010.01883.x", "medline_journal" "Mycoses", "title" "Characterisation of Pga1, a putative Candida albicans cell wall protein necessary for proper adhesion and biofilm formation.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "491-500", "volume" "54", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20406396}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0031505", "name" "fungal-type cell wall organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031452", "name" "Protein Kre1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 40, "alignment:full" 232}}}
