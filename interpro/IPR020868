{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This bifunctional enzyme catalyses the condensation of formaldehyde with tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) to 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin and the formation of ribulose-5-phosphate and formaldehyde from 3-hexulose-6-phosphate. Formaldehyde activating enzyme (Fae) was first discovered in methylotrophic bacteria, where it is involved in the oxidation of methanol to CO2 and in formaldehyde detoxification. The genome of Methanosarcina barkeri contains both the faeA gene as well as a second gene, faeB-hpsB, which is shown to code for a 42kDa protein with both Fae activity and hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) activity [[cite:PUB00053140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01268" "Bifunctional enzyme Fae/Hps [fae-hps]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional enzyme Fae/Hps", "short" "Fae/Hps"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 593, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 618, "sets" 0, "proteins" 618, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 527}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
