{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents AF1q, encoded by the MLLT11 gene, which is a fusion partner of the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene. The MLL-MLLT11 fusion is linked to the acute leukemias [[cite:PUB00062140]].</p>\n\n<p>At the protein level, AF1q/MLLT11 is highly expressed in thymus and all leukemic cell lines, and is differentially expressed during neuronal differentiation [[cite:PUB00061787], [cite:PUB00061786]]. It interacts with the Notch signalling pathway to regulate the emergence of human prothymocytes [[cite:PUB00062141]]. It has also been shown that AF1q increases radiation-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of BAD (BCL-2 antagonist of cell death) in human squamous carcinoma via NF-kappaB [[cite:PUB00062142]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15404" "PROTEIN AF1Q"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MLLT11 family", "short" "MLLT11_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 541, "taxa" 1923, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 687, "sets" 0, "proteins" 687, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 497}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026778", :literature {"PUB00062140" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lee SG" "Park TS" "Yang JJ" "Oh SH" "Cho EH" "Lee S" "Oh D" "Huh JY" "Marschalek R" "Meyer C."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Haematol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000338258", "medline_journal" "Acta Haematol", "title" "Molecular Identification of a New Splicing Variant of the MLL - MLLT11 Fusion Transcript in an Adult with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and t(1;11)(q21;q23).", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "131-8", "volume" "128", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22854283}, "PUB00061787" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Lin HJ" "Shaffer KM" "Sun Z" "Jay G" "He WW" "Ma W."], "ISO_journal" "Brain Res.
