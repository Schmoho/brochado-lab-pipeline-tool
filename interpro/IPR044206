{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of EG45-like domain containing proteins, including EGC1/2 from Arabidopsis and CjBAp12 from Citrus jambhiri. EGC2, also known as AtPNP-A, is an immunoreactant plant natriuretic peptide (irPNP) analog [[cite:PUB00095497]]. It shares some similarity with the cell wall loosening expansins but does not contain the carbohydrate-binding wall anchor. It signals via the second messenger cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate and modulates ion and water transport and homeostasis. It is secreted into the apoplastic space in response to stress and can enhance its own expression [[cite:PUB00095500]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036908", "name" "RlpA-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47295" "EG45-LIKE DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EG45-like domain containing protein, plant", "short" "EGC1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 214, "taxa" 869, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1557, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1557, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 903}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044206", :literature {"PUB00095497" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Ludidi NN" "Heazlewood JL" "Seoighe C" "Irving HR" "Gehring CA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
