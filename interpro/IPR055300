These proteins are involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. They can bind to specific methylated forms of histone H3, facilitating the recruitment of various effectors to mediate gene expression [[cite:PUB00155324], [cite:PUB00155325]]. Some members act as transcriptional activators, directly binding to DNA sequences to regulate target gene transcription, thereby influencing cellular processes such as the regulation of grain size in plants [[cite:PUB00155325]]. They are also capable of promoting active chromatin states by increasing levels of specific histone modifications at target loci.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46524" "CW-TYPE ZINC FINGER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine-tryptophan domain-containing zinc finger protein 3/5/7", "short" "CWZF3/5/7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 300, "taxa" 1207, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2074, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2074, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 512}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055300", :literature {"PUB00155325" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Huang Y" "Bai X" "Cheng N" "Xiao J" "Li X" "Xing Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14646", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Wide Grain 7 increases grain width by enhancing H3K4me3 enrichment in the OsMADS1 promoter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "517-528", "volume" "102", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31830332}, "PUB00155324" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhang Z" "Zhang F" "Cheng ZJ" "Liu LL" "Lin QB" "Wu FQ" "Zhang H" "Wang JL" "Wang J" "Guo XP" "Zhang X" "Lei CL" "Zhao ZC" "Zhu SS" "Wan JM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.06.013", "medline_journal" "Plant Sci", "title" "Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "168-176", "volume" "263", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28818372}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055300", "name" "Cysteine-tryptophan domain-containing zinc finger protein 3/5/7", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
