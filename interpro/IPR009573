{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The iron guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor biosynthesis enzymes are encoded in a cluster of at least seven conserved genes (hcgA-G). This family represents the (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase HgcC [[cite:PUB00098593], [cite:PUB00098592]], which covalently attaches the methyl group at the 3-position of the pyridinol ring. It is predominantly found as a monomer in solution, composed of a Rossmann-like coenzyme-binding-domain consisting of six parallel and one peripheral antiparallel strand flanked by six α-helices and a smaller α/β domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5d4v", "name" "HcgC with SAH and a guanylylpyridinol (GP) derivative"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06690" "FeGP cofactor biosynthesis protein, methyltransferase HcgC"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019265" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP019265 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FeGP cofactor biosynthesis protein, methyltransferase HcgC", "short" "HcgC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 164, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 123, "sets" 0, "proteins" 123, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 108}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009573", :literature {"PUB00098593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Fujishiro T" "Bai L" "Xu T" "Xie X" "Schick M" "Kahnt J" "Rother M" "Hu X" "Ermler U" "Shima S."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "Identification of HcgC as a SAM-Dependent Pyridinol Methyltransferase in [Fe]-Hydrogenase Cofactor Biosynthesis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "9648-51", "volume" "55", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27391308}, "PUB00098592" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Bai L" "Wagner T" "Xu T" "Hu X" "Ermler U" "Shima S."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "A Water-Bridged H-Bonding Network Contributes to the Catalysis of the SAM-Dependent C-Methyltransferase HcgC.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "10806-10809", "volume" "56", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28682478}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009573", "name" "FeGP cofactor biosynthesis protein, methyltransferase HcgC", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 10, "alignment:full" 23}}}
