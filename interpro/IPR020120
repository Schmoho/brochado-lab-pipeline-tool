{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this entry represent Orf8 from killer plasmid K2 (pGKL2) of Kluyveromyces lactis (Yeast) (Candida sphaerica). K2 contains ten open reading frames. Some of the ORFs overlap on different strands and some on the same strand and at least 8 of the 10 ORFs are transcribed. Comparison of the sequence of pGKL2 to the sequence of the K2 plasmid from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain F102-2 revealed only one nucleotide difference showing a very high degree of conservation of the plasmid sequences from the two yeasts [[cite:PUB00045923]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17568" "Family of unknown function (DUF5474)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasmid pGKL2, Orf8", "short" "Plasmid_pGKL2_Orf8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 28, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020120", :literature {"PUB00045923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Tommasino M" "Ricci S" "Galeotti CL."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/16.13.5863", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Genome organization of the killer plasmid pGK12 from Kluyveromyces lactis.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "5863-78", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3041369}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020120", "name" "Plasmid pGKL2, Orf8", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
