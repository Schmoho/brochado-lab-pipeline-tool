{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A fairly deep split separates this polyprenyltransferase subfamily from the set of mitochondrial and proteobacterial 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferases, described in [interpro:IPR006370]. Protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (heme O synthase) ([interpro:IPR006369]) is more distantly related. Because no species appears to have both this protein and a member of [interpro:IPR006370], it is likely that this family of sequences represent 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase, a critical enzyme of ubiquinone biosynthesis, in the Archaea, Gram-positive bacteria, Aquifex aeolicus, and the Chlamydias. Overlap is also strong with species that synthesize menaquinone by the (alternate) futalosine pathway, suggesting MqnP activity [[cite:PUB00106614]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044878", "name" "UbiA prenyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01475" "UbiA-like polyprenyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyprenyltransferase UbiA-like", "short" "Polyprenyltransferase_UbiA-li"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1674, "taxa" 6595, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7991, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7991, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6018}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"} {"accession" "GenProp0829", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0829"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006371", :literature {"PUB00106614" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6173", "authors" ["Cheng W" "Li W."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structural insights into ubiquinone biosynthesis in membranes.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "878-81", "volume" "343", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24558159}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000537", "name" "UbiA prenyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006369", "name" "Protohaem IX farnesyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016315", "name" "Protohaem IX farnesyltransferase, mitochondria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR026046", "name" "UbiA prenyltransferase domain containing protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004657", "name" "1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011937", "name" "2-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone phytyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR039653", "name" "Prenyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006370", "name" "4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006371", "name" "Polyprenyltransferase UbiA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR044502", "name" "Homogentisate solanesyltransferase AtHST-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR050475", "name" "Prenyltransferase/isoprenoid biosynthesis", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006372", "name" "Bacteriochlorophyll/chlorophyll synthetase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011799", "name" "Chlorophyll synthase, ChlG", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR023547", "name" "Digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
