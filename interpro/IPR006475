{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of sequences represent the beta subunit of the holoenzyme citrate lyase ([ec:4.1.3.6]) composed of alpha ([ec:2.8.3.10]), beta, and acyl carrier protein subunits in a stoichiometric relationship of 6:6:6. Citrate lyase is an enzyme which converts citrate to oxaloacetate. In bacteria, this reaction is involved in citrate fermentation. The beta subunit catalyzes the reaction (3S)-citryl-CoA = acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate. The group contains an experimentally characterised member from Leuconostoc mesenteroides [[cite:PUB00005807]]. The group contains sequences from a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria. For Gram-negative bacteria, it appears that only the sequences from gammaproteobacteria are present.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015813", "name" "Pyruvate/Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR040442", "name" "Pyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01588" "citrate (pro-3S)-lyase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate lyase, beta subunit, bacteria", "short" "Citrate_lyase_beta_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 261, "taxa" 1894, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2091, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2091, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1674}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0672"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
