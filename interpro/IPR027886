{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family (previously DUF4555) includes the homologs of human sperm-associated microtubule inner protein 4 (SPMIP4, also known as C7orf31) that is found predominantly in testis [[cite:PUB00151495]]. SPMIP4 is a microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the axonemal dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs).</p>\n\n<p>Members of this family adopt rather extended conformation and contain a single or multiple Mn motifs.  Each Mn motif consists of a 5- to 6-residue helix flanked by a Tyr/Phe residue on one end and by a Ser/Thr on the other that binds the shoulder of the α-tubulin S9/S10 loop [[cite:PUB00151502]]. It was reported that a single Mn motif is sufficient for microtubule binding in vitro [[cite:PUB00151501]]. Members of this family are likely to stabilise the microtubule structure in the sperm flagella [[cite:PUB00151496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15093" "Sperm-associated microtubule inner protein 4"}, "panther" {"PTHR31393" "C5ORF31"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sperm-associated microtubule inner protein 4", "short" "SPMIP4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 314, "taxa" 1402, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 770, "sets" 0, "proteins" 641, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 364}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027886", :literature {"PUB00151496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Leung MR" "Zeng J" "Wang X" "Roelofs MC" "Huang W" "Zenezini Chiozzi R" "Hevler JF" "Heck AJR" "Dutcher SK" "Brown A" "Zhang R" "Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.05.026", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural specializations of the sperm tail.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2880-2896.e17", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37327785}, "PUB00151495" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sun J" "Lu Y" "Nozawa K" "Xu Z" "Morohoshi A" "Castaneda JM" "Noda T" "Miyata H" "Abbasi F" "Shawki HH" "Takahashi S" "Devlin DJ" "Yu Z" "Matzuk RM" "Garcia TX" "Matzuk MM" "Ikawa M."], "ISO_journal" "Biol Reprod", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioaa083", "medline_journal" "Biol Reprod", "title" "CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in mice uncovers 13 testis- or epididymis-enriched genes individually dispensable for male reproduction†.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "183-194", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32588039}, "PUB00151502" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang X" "Fu Y" "Beatty WL" "Ma M" "Brown A" "Sibley LD" "Zhang R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23351-1", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Cryo-EM structure of cortical microtubules from human parasite Toxoplasma gondii identifies their microtubule inner proteins.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "3065", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34031406}, "PUB00151501" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Lefevre J" "Savarin P" "Gans P" "Hamon L" "Clement MJ" "David MO" "Bosc C" "Andrieux A" "Curmi PA."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M113.457267", "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Structural basis for the association of MAP6 protein with microtubules and its regulation by calmodulin.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "24910-22", "volume" "288", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23831686}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027886", "name" "Sperm-associated microtubule inner protein 4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 429}}}
