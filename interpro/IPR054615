{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family share a conserved N-terminal region of about 33 amino acids, with variable length C-terminal regions. As the conserved region is highly hydrophobic, and member proteins are nearly always encoded adjacent to sodium:solute symporter family proteins, typically with coding regions that overlap by at least one nucleotide, it seems likely that members of this family act as a transporter small subunit or assembly factor. Note that because members of this family may be shorter than 40 amino acids, members of this family may have been missed systematically by many annotation pipeline versions. Members of this family are found in both archaea and bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045580" "symporter small accessory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Symporter small accessory protein", "short" "Symport_access"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 96, "taxa" 754, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 460, "sets" 0, "proteins" 460, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 381}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054615", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054615", "name" "Symporter small accessory protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
