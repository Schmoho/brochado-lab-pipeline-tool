{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a family of redox proteins related to the succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases (FRDs) of Escherichia coli, mitochondria, and other well-characterised systems. A member of this family from Shewanella frigidimarina (strain NCIMB 400) is characterised as a water-soluble periplasmic protein with four haem groups, a non-covalently bound FAD, and essentially unidirectional fumarate reductase activity. At least seven distinct members of this family are found in Shewanella oneidensis, a species able to use a wide variety of pathways for respiration, whose physiological reductant is unknown. Proteins with the FRD-like domain architecture are widely distributed among various bacteria that comprise a new type of water-soluble NADH:fumarate oxidoreductases. NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase (or FRD) from Klebsiella pneumoniae catalyses the anaerobic reduction of fumarate to succinate using NADH as the inherent electron donor [[cite:PUB00097229]]. This entry includes Urocanate reductase (urdA) from Shewanella oneidensis, which catalyses the two-electron reduction of urocanate to dihydrourocanate and contains a FAD-binding domain homologous to the FAD-binding domains of succinate dehydrogenase and periplasmic fumarate reductase [[cite:PUB00097228]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5zyn", "name" "Fumarate reductase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01813" "flavocytochrome c"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flavocytochrome c", "short" "Flavocytochrome_c"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1818, "taxa" 6617, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7005, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6975, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5032}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
