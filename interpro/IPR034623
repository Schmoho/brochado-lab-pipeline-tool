{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes galactarate dehydratase III ([swissprot:A9CG74]) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. It catalyzes the dehydration of m-galactarate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate, as part of the synthesis of alpha-ketoglutarate. It has also been shown to convert D-galacturonate to 3-deoxy-D-xylo-hexarate or 3-deoxy-D-lyxo-hexarate, an unexpected reaction for an enolase superfamily member, because it involves abstraction of a proton alpha to an aldehyde group rather than a proton alpha to a carboxylate group [[cite:PUB00083794]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4jn7", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF AN ENOLASE (PUTATIVE GALACTARATE DEHYDRATASE, TARGET EFI-500740) FROM AGROBACTERIUM RADIOBACTER, BOUND NA and L-MALATE, ORDERED ACTIVE SITE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036849", "name" "Enolase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00563" "galactarate dehydratase 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galactarate dehydratase 3", "short" "Galactarate_dehydratase_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 65, "taxa" 448, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 404, "sets" 0, "proteins" 404, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 310}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034623", :literature {"PUB00083794" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Groninger-Poe FP" "Bouvier JT" "Vetting MW" "Kalyanaraman C" "Kumar R" "Almo SC" "Jacobson MP" "Gerlt JA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi5005377", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Evolution of enzymatic activities in the enolase superfamily: galactarate dehydratase III from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "4192-203", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24926996}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034593", "name" "D-galactonate dehydratase DgoD-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023592", "name" "D-galactonate dehydratase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR033977", "name" "Galactarate dehydratase 2", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR034589", "name" "D-mannonate dehydratase-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR034587", "name" "D-mannonate dehydratase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR034598", "name" "D-Glucarate dehydratase-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017653", "name" "Glucarate dehydratase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR034599", "name" "Gluconate dehydratase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR034611", "name" "D-tartrate dehydratase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR034622", "name" "4R-hydroxyproline betaine 2-epimerase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR034623", "name" "Galactarate dehydratase 3", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR034624", "name" "Xylonate dehydratase 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
