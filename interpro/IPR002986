One of these families includes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyses the transformation of ornithine into putrescine; prokaryotic diaminopimelate decarboxylase, which catalyses the conversion of diaminopimelate into lysine; Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci protein, tabA, which is probably involved in tabtoxin biosynthesis and is similar to diaminopimelate decarboxylase; and bacterial and plant biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase, which catalyses the transformation of arginine into agmatine, the first step in putrescine synthesis from arginine.</p>\n\n<p>Although these proteins, which are known collectively as group IV decarboxylases [[cite:PUB00001452]], probably share a common evolutionary origin, their levels of sequence similarity are low, being confined to a few short conserved regions.
