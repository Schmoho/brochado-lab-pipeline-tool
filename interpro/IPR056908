The fibre-tail adaptor acts as a fulcrum, encircling the dodecameric adaptor I and providing the anchoring sites for the 5-fold symmetric fibres I and II.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23140" "Podophage GP4 fiber I protein gp80"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Podophage GP4 fiber I protein gp80-like", "short" "Gp80-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 480, "taxa" 3140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2251, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2203, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 793}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056908", :literature {"PUB00155639" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Zheng J" "Chen W" "Xiao H" "Yang F" "Song J" "Cheng L" "Liu H."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2023.168258", "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Asymmetric Structure of Podophage GP4 Reveals a Novel Architecture of Three Types of Tail Fibers.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "168258", "volume" "435", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37660940}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056908", "name" "Podophage GP4 fiber I protein gp80-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 85, "alignment:full" 570}}}
