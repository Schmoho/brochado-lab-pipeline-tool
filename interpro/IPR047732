{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins mainly found in proteobacteria, including inner membrane protein YedE from Escherichia coli and Cj1500 from Campylobacter jejuni ([swissprot:Q8RN00], also known as FdhT), which  was show to be essential for formate dehydrogenase (a selenocysteine-containing enzyme) expression and activity [[cite:PUB00105332]]. Members of this family are predicted multiple membrane-spanning proteins, and therefore thought likely to be transporters [[cite:PUB00098047]]. All proteins belonging to this group carry a sulphur transport domain ([interpro:IPR007272]). It appears that all species whose genomes encode a member of this family produce selenocysteine-containing enzymes, typically formate dehydrogenase. This family is related to (but distinct from) that of [interpro:IPR026366], which is similarly restricted to species with pathways for selenium incorporation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033796" "selenium metabolism membrane protein YedE/FdhT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inner membrane protein YedE-like", "short" "YedE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 207, "taxa" 1588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1882, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1882, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1478}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047732", :literature {"PUB00098047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lin J" "Peng T" "Jiang L" "Ni JZ" "Liu Q" "Chen L" "Zhang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol Evol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genome Biol Evol", "title" "Comparative genomics reveals new candidate genes involved in selenium metabolism in prokaryotes.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "664-76", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25638258}, "PUB00105332" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Shaw FL" "Mulholland F" "Le Gall G" "Porcelli I" "Hart DJ" "Pearson BM" "van Vliet AH."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Selenium-dependent biogenesis of formate dehydrogenase in Campylobacter jejuni is controlled by the fdhTU accessory genes.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "3814-23", "volume" "194", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22609917}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047732", "name" "Inner membrane protein YedE-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
