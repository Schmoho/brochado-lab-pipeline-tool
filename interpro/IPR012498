{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha-A conotoxin PIVA ([swissprot:P55963]) is the major paralytic toxin found in the venom produced by the piscivorous snail Conus purpurascens. This peptide acts by blocking the acetylcholine-binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction [[cite:PUB00016491]]. The overall shape of the peptide is described as an \"iron\" with a highly charged hydrophilic loop of 15S-19R forming the \"handle\" domain that is exposed to the exterior of the protein. The stability of the conotoxin is primarily governed by three disulphide bonds. A triangular structural motif formed by residues 19R, 12H and 6Y is thought to constitute a \"binding core\" that is important in binding to the acetylcholine receptor [[cite:PUB00016367]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07829" "Alpha-A conotoxin PIVA-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-A conotoxin PIVA-like", "short" "Toxin_14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 20, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012498", :literature {"PUB00016491" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Hopkins C" "Grilley M" "Miller C" "Shon KJ" "Cruz LJ" "Gray WR" "Dykert J" "Rivier J" "Yoshikami D" "Olivera BM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
