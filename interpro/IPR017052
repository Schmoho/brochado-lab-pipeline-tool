{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone essential for the regulation of blood pressure. In cardiac myocytes, ANP is synthesized as a precursor, pro-ANP, which is converted to biologically active ANP by the serine peptidase corin [[cite:PUB00043506]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme corin, which is a type II transmembrane serine protease that belongs to MEROPS peptidase family S1A (clan PA(S)), which is abundantly expressed in the heart. Other serine proteases such as thrombin and kallikrein had previously also been shown to cleave pro-ANP in vitro, but corin has now been shown to be the endogenous pro-ANP convertase in cardiomyocytes [[cite:PUB00043507]]. For corin to cleave its substrate, pro-ANP, it should be catalytically active and located in close proximity [[cite:PUB00043508]]. Corin is highly sequence specific. Corin-mediated pro-ANP activation may play a role in regulating blood pressure [[cite:PUB00043506]].</p>\n\n<p>N-Glycosylation may influence the subcellular localization and biological activity of corin and tunicamycin treatment also significantly reduces corin activity [[cite:PUB00043509]].</p>\n\n<p>Corin in involved in promoting trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling in pregnancy. Mutations in the corin gene cause pre-eclampsia/eclampsia 5 (PEE5) [[cite:PUB00094734]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036376" "Atrial natriuteric peptide-converting enzyme"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme corin", "short" "Corin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 208, "taxa" 810, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 704, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 353}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
