{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)-I and -II are small secreted peptides that stimulate the survival, and promote the proliferation and differentiation, of many cell types [[cite:PUB00053602]]. In biological fluids, these growth factors are usually bound to IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), which regulate their availability and activity by prolonging their half-life and modulating their receptor interactions.</p>\n\n<p>To date, six IGFBP family members have been identified (termed IGFBP1-6) [[cite:PUB00053603]]. They share a conserved gene (intron-exon) organisation and high IGF binding affinity. Structurally, the proteins also share a common domain architecture, possessing a conserved N-terminal IGFBP domain, a highly variable mid-section, and a thyroglobulin type-1 (Tg1) domain in their C-terminal regions.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to their role in the regulation of IGF activity, there is evidence for the direct association of IGFBPs with a variety of extracellular and cell surface molecules [[cite:PUB00053604], [cite:PUB00053605]], with consequent effects upon important biological processes. These include modulation of bone cell proliferation [[cite:PUB00053606]], and growth arrest of breast and prostate cancer cells [[cite:PUB00053604], [cite:PUB00053607]].</p>\n\n<p>IGFBP4 is abundant in serum, and is expressed in many different tissues. The protein functions as a cardiogenic growth factor in mice -an effect that is IGF-independent, and mediated by inhibition on the canonical Wnt signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00053618]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036857", "name" "Thyroglobulin type-1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009030", "name" "Growth factor receptor cysteine-rich domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01980" "Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4", "short" "IGFBP-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 530, "taxa" 1833, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2011, "sets" 0, "proteins" 717, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 526}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022327", :literature {"PUB00053602" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Stewart CE" "Rotwein P."], "ISO_journal" "Physiol.
