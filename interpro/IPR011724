{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a very small (as short as 33 amino acids) protein of unknown function, essentially always found in an operon with CydAB, subunits of the cytochrome d terminal oxidase [[cite:PUB00015302]]. It begins with an aromatic motif MWYFXW and appears to contain a membrane-spanning helix. This protein appears to be restricted to the Proteobacteria and exist in a single copy only. We suggest it may be a membrane subunit of the terminal oxidase. The family is named after the Escherichia coli member YbgT ([swissprot:P56100]). This model excludes the apparently related protein YccB ([swissprot:P24244]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02106" "cytochrome bd-I oxidase subunit CydX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyd operon protein YbgT", "short" "Cyd_oper_YbgT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1028, "taxa" 5425, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4931, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4931, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3937}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1515", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1515"} {"accession" "GenProp0617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0617"} {"accession" "GenProp1141", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1141"} {"accession" "GenProp1269", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1269"} {"accession" "GenProp1608", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1608"} {"accession" "GenProp1373", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1373"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
