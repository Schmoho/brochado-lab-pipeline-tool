{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diol dehydratase ([ec:4.2.1.28]) and glycerol dehydratase ([ec:4.2.1.30]) are two iso-functional enzymes that can each catalyse the conversion of 1,2-propanediol, 1,2-ethanediol and glycerol to the corresponding deoxy aldehydes (propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde and 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, respectively). This reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism involving coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl) as an essential cofactor. Even though they catalyse the same reaction, these two enzymes (1) differ in their substrate preferences (diol dehydratase has a higher affinity for 1,2-propanediol and glycerol dehydratase for glycerol [[cite:PUB00013627]]); (2) they participate in different pathways (dihydroxyacetone [DHA] pathway for glycerol dehydratase and 1,2-propanediol degradation pathway for diol dehydratase); and (3) in those organisms where both enzymes are produced (such as Klebsiella and Citrobacter), the genes for them are independently regulated: glycerol dehydratase is induced when Klebsiella pneumoniae grows in glycerol-containing medium, whereas diol dehydratase is fully induced when it grows in propane-1,2-diol-containing medium, but only slightly in the glycerol medium [[cite:PUB00013628], [cite:PUB00013629]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Both diol dehydratase and glycerol dehydratase comprise three subunits: PduC/PduD/PduE or PddA/PddB/PddC for propanediol dehydratase, and GldA/Gld/B/GldC or DhaB/DhaC/DhaE for glycerol dehydratase.
