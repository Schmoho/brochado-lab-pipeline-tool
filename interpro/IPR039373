{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes glutamate carboxypeptidase 2 (FOLH1) and its homologues from peptidase family M28 subfamily B.  Not all members of this subfamily are peptidases, and non-peptidase homologues include transferrin receptor proteins (TFRC).</p>\n\n<p>FOLH1 is a zinc-dependent carboxypeptidase that also acts as a folate hydrolase and N-acetylated-alpha-linked-acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase).  It has a preference for tri-alpha-glutamate peptides [[cite:PUB00050638]].  It is required for the uptake of folate in the intestine, and in the brain modulates excitatory neurotransmission through the hydrolysis of the neuropeptide, N-aceylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), releasing glutamate.  Two zinc ions are bound per molecule [[cite:PUB00039905]].</p>\n\n<p>TFRC acts as a lipid sensor, controlling the fusion of mitochondria by modulating the activation of the JNK pathway [[cite:PUB00153046]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5d29", "name" "X-ray structure of human glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) in complex with a hydroxamate inhibitor JHU241"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036757", "name" "Transferrin receptor-like, dimerisation domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10404" "N-ACETYLATED-ALPHA-LINKED ACIDIC DIPEPTIDASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transferrin receptor protein 1/Glutamate carboxypeptidase 2-like", "short" "Peptidase_M28B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 111, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2814, "taxa" 10211, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18140, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11848}, "pathways" 92}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
