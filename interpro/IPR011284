{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 3-oxoacyl-[ACP] reductase, also called 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, an enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis found in many plant and bacterial species. This enzyme is involved in type II fatty acid biosynthesis, where the individual metabolic transformations are carried out by different enzymes rather than by a single enzyme as occurs in type I fatty acid biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00028039]]. This family includes Sinorhizobium meliloti NodG, which has been shown to be a 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase and can play a role in fatty acid synthesis [[cite:PUB00083882]].</p>\r\n<p>Structural studies show that the enzyme is a tetramer which forms a typical Rossman fold [[cite:PUB00025859], [cite:PUB00028040]]. Unlike other members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, the enzyme undergoes a marked conformational change upon binding of the NADP(H)cofactor. This conformational change aligns the side chains of the catalytic triad at the active site in an active conformation and increases the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ph3", "name" "Crystal structure of 3-oxoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] reductase TTHA0415 from Thermus thermophilus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01830" "3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase", "short" "3oxo_ACP_reduc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 76, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7652, "taxa" 30375, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34347, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34346, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26160}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0681", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0681"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
