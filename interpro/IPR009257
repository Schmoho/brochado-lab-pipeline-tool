{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several short Chordopoxvirus proteins which are homologous to the A30L protein of Vaccinia virus, also known as Protein OPG157. The vaccinia virus A30L protein is required for the association of electron-dense, granular, proteinaceous material with the concave surfaces of crescent membranes, an early step in viral morphogenesis. A30L is known to interact with the G7L protein and it has been shown that the stability of each is dependent on its association with the other [[cite:PUB00012223], [cite:PUB00012257]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06015" "Chordopoxvirus A30L protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chordopoxvirus A30L", "short" "Chordopox_A30L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 178, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009257", :literature {"PUB00012257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Szajner P" "Weisberg AS" "Wolffe EJ" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
