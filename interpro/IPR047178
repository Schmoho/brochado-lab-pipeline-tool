{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-interacting proteins (JIP) scaffold family, a group of scaffold proteins that regulate signalling by stress-activated MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase) [[cite:PUB00102100]], including C-Jun-amino-terminal kinase-interacting protein 1/2 from humans (JIP1/2). These proteins selectively mediate JNK signalling by aggregating specific components of the MAPK cascade to form a functional JNK signalling module and are required for JNK activation in response to excitotoxic stress [[cite:PUB00102101]]. They regulate the activation of MAPK8/JNK1 and differentiation of CD8+ T-cells [[cite:PUB00102102]]. JIP-1 from Drosophila melanogaster, also known as JNK-interacting protein 1, is known to play roles in fast axonal transport that are important for neuron structure and function [[cite:PUB00102098]]. Members of this family are found in animals.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7nyo", "name" "Mutant A541L of SH3 domain of JNK-interacting Protein 1 (JIP1)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47437" "JNK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "JNK-interacting protein 1", "short" "JIP1_scaffold"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 930, "taxa" 3607, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1741}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047178", :literature {"PUB00102100" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Whitmarsh AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Soc Trans", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Soc Trans", "title" "The JIP family of MAPK scaffold proteins.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "828-32", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17052208}, "PUB00102098" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Horiuchi D" "Barkus RV" "Pilling AD" "Gassman A" "Saxton WM."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Biol", "title" "APLIP1, a kinesin binding JIP-1/JNK scaffold protein, influences the axonal transport of both vesicles and mitochondria in Drosophila.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2137-41", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16332540}, "PUB00102101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Whitmarsh AJ" "Kuan CY" "Kennedy NJ" "Kelkar N" "Haydar TF" "Mordes JP" "Appel M" "Rossini AA" "Jones SN" "Flavell RA" "Rakic P" "Davis RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Requirement of the JIP1 scaffold protein for stress-induced JNK activation.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2421-32", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11562351}, "PUB00102102" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Cunningham CA" "Knudson KM" "Peng BJ" "Teixeiro E" "Daniels MA."], "ISO_journal" "Eur J Immunol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Eur J Immunol", "title" "The POSH/JIP-1 scaffold network regulates TCR-mediated JNK1 signals and effector function in CD8(+) T cells.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "3361-71", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23963642}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046328", "name" "regulation of JNK cascade", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047178", "name" "JNK-interacting protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
