{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from tailed bacteriophages and prophages from proteobacteria known as the ANR family of transcriptional regulators, which includes the AggR-activated regulator Aar found in pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and Pasteurellaceae. The name ANR (AraC Negative Regulators) refers to an effect on, rather than homology to, certain AraC family transcriptional regulators [[cite:PUB00105221]]. Aar is likely to act directly or indirectly as a virulence suppressor and perhaps modulate virulence as a result of selection towards clinical attenuation. This hypothesis is supported by increased pathogenicity in aar-negative strains in Mali and Brazil [[cite:PUB00151014], [cite:PUB00151015]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033650" "ANR family transcriptional regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ANR transcriptional regulator", "short" "ANR_neg_reg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 71, "taxa" 626, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 859, "sets" 0, "proteins" 859, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 620}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047666", :literature {"PUB00105221" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Santiago AE" "Ruiz-Perez F" "Jo NY" "Vijayakumar V" "Gong MQ" "Nataro JP."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "A large family of antivirulence regulators modulates the effects of transcriptional activators in Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e1004153", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24875828}, "PUB00151014" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Boisen N" "Scheutz F" "Rasko DA" "Redman JC" "Persson S" "Simon J" "Kotloff KL" "Levine MM" "Sow S" "Tamboura B" "Toure A" "Malle D" "Panchalingam S" "Krogfelt KA" "Nataro JP."], "ISO_journal" "J Infect Dis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Infect Dis", "title" "Genomic characterization of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli from children in Mali.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "431-44", "volume" "205", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22184729}, "PUB00151015" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Lima IFN" "Boisen N" "Silva JDQ" "Havt A" "de Carvalho EB" "Soares AM" "Lima NL" "Mota RMS" "Nataro JP" "Guerrant RL" "Lima AAM."], "ISO_journal" "J Med Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Med Microbiol", "title" "Prevalence of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and its virulence-related genes in a case-control study among children from north-eastern Brazil.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "683-693", "volume" "62", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23429698}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047666", "name" "ANR transcriptional regulator", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
