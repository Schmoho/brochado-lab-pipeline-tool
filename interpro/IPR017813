{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Low-molecular weight thiols play an essential role in the metabolism of organsism as coenzymes and cofactors that facilitate important biochemical processes in conjunction with proteins. The predominant low-molecular weight thiol in the actinomycetes is mycothiol, which is involved in the maintenance of cellualar redox state, detoxification of electrophiles and resistance to antimicrobials [[cite:PUB00043431], [cite:PUB00043432]]. The pathway of mycothiol biosynthesis is therefore a potential target for the development of new drugs to treat pathogenic actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the MshD protein catalysing the final step of mycothiol biosynthesis, the acetylation of the cysteinyl amine in cysteine-glucosamine-inositol (Cys-GlcN-Ins) [[cite:PUB00043433]]. MshD is a monomeric enzyme consisting of two tandemly-repeated domains which each adopt the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold [[cite:PUB00043433]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2c27", "name" "The Structure of Mycothiol Synthase in Complex with des- AcetylMycothiol and CoenzymeA."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF021524" "Mycothiol acetyltransferase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01698" "Mycothiol acetyltransferase [mshD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03448" "mycothiol synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mycothiol acetyltransferase", "short" "Mycothiol_AcTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1645, "taxa" 4677, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4654, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4654, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3596}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0753", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0753"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
