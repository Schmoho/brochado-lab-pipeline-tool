{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small group of nuclease SbcCD subunit C (SbcC) proteins, mainly from gammaproteobacteria. SbcC are known are part of an exonuclease complex with sbcD homologues. SbcCD cleaves DNA hairpin structures. These structures can inhibit DNA replication and are intermediates in certain DNA recombination reactions. The complex acts as a 3'->5' double strand exonuclease that can open hairpins. It also has a 5' single-strand endonuclease activity [[cite:PUB00061927]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entry also includes a small number of proteins annotated as probable DNA double-strand break repair Rad50 ATPase, but which are experimentally uncharacterised.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00618" "exonuclease subunit SbcC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclease SbcC, gammaproteobacteria type", "short" "SbcC_gammaproteobac_type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 187, "taxa" 1563, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2035, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2035, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1595}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004592", :literature {"PUB00061927" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Chen Z" "Luong TT" "Lee CY."], "ISO_journal" "J.
