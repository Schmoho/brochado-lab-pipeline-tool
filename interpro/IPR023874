{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of uncharacterised protein of about 400 amino acids in length that contains a radical SAM domain in the N-terminal half. Members of this family are present in about twenty percent of prokaryotic genomes, always paired with a member of the conserved hypothetical protein [ncbifam:TIGR03915]. Roughly forty percent of the members of that family exist as fusions with a uracil-DNA glycosylase-like region, [ncbifam:TIGR03914]. In DNA, uracil results from deamidation of cytosine, forming U/G mismatches that lead to mutation, and so uracil-DNA glycosylase is a DNA repair enzyme. This indirect connection, and the recurring role or radical SAM proteins in modification chemistries, suggest that this protein may act in DNA modification, repair, or both.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03916" "putative DNA modification/repair radical SAM protein"}, "sfld" {"SFLDG01102" "Uncharacterised Radical SAM Subgroup 15"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA modification/repair radical SAM protein, putative", "short" "DNA_rSAM_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2181, "taxa" 9160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8916, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8916, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7065}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0903", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0903"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023874", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023874", "name" "DNA modification/repair radical SAM protein, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
