{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Hpn-like protein HpnL, or Hpn-2, including founding member HP1432 from Helicobacter pylori ([swissprot:O25973]). HpnL is a histidine and glutamine-rich metal-binding polypeptide that binds nickel, among other metals [[cite:PUB00105258]]. It may help deliver sequestered nickel for the biosynthesis of urease, which is critical to the survival of Helicobacter pylori during exposures to strongly acidic conditions. This protein is a paralogue to the histidine-rich nickel storage protein Hpn (e.g. HP1427) [[cite:PUB00105257]]. Both nickel-binding proteins are expressed in response to nickel, under control of the regulator NikR [[cite:PUB00105259]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this family are found exclusively in Helicobacter.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033704" "nickel-binding protein HpnL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nickel-binding protein HpnL", "short" "HpnL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 22, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049867", :literature {"PUB00105257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Seshadri S" "Benoit SL" "Maier RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Roles of His-rich hpn and hpn-like proteins in Helicobacter pylori nickel physiology.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "4120-6", "volume" "189", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17384182}, "PUB00105259" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Vinella D" "Fischer F" "Vorontsov E" "Gallaud J" "Malosse C" "Michel V" "Cavazza C" "Robbe-Saule M" "Richaud P" "Chamot-Rooke J" "Brochier-Armanet C" "De Reuse H."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Evolution of Helicobacter: Acquisition by Gastric Species of Two Histidine-Rich Proteins Essential for Colonization.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e1005312", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26641249}, "PUB00105258" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Benoit SL" "Miller EF" "Maier RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "Helicobacter pylori stores nickel to aid its host colonization.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "580-4", "volume" "81", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23230291}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049867", "name" "Nickel-binding protein HpnL", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
