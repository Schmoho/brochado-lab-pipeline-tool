{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>6-phospho 3-hexuloisomerase (PHI, also known as rmpB) is part of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, which in one direction removes the toxic metabolite formaldehyde by assimilation into fructose-6-phosphate [[cite:PUB00070744]]. In the other direction, in species lacking a complete pentose phosphate pathway, the RuMP pathway yields ribulose-5-phosphate, necessary for nucleotide biosynthesis, at the cost of also yielding formaldehyde. These latter species tend usually have a formaldehyde-activating enzyme to attach formaldehyde to the C1 carrier tetrahydromethanopterin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1m3s", "name" "Crystal structure of YckF from Bacillus subtilis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046348", "name" "SIS domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05005" "SIS_PHI"}, "panther" {"PTHR43443" "3-HEXULOSE-6-PHOSPHATE ISOMERASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03127" "6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-hexulose-6-phosphate isomerase", "short" "PHI/rmpB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1248, "taxa" 6124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6144, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6144, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4914}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1732", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1732"} {"accession" "GenProp0673", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0673"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
