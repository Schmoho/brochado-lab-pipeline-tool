{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyses the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-SCoM) and coenzyme B (HS-CoB) to methane and the corresponding heterosulphide CoM-S-S-CoB ([ec:2.8.4.1]), the final step in methane biosynthesis. This reaction proceeds under anaerobic conditions by methanogenic Archaea [[cite:PUB00035993]], and requires a nickel-porphinoid prosthetic group, coenzyme F430, which is in the EPR-detectable Ni(I) oxidation state in the active enzyme. Studies on a catalytically inactive enzyme aerobically co-crystallized with coenzyme M displayed a fully occupied coenzyme M-binding site with no alternate conformations. The binding of coenzyme M appears to induce specific conformational changes that suggests a molecular mechanism by which the enzyme ensures that methyl-coenzyme M enters the substrate channel prior to coenzyme B, as required by the active-site geometry [[cite:PUB00010614]].</p>\r\n<p>MCR is a hexamer composed of 2 alpha, 2 beta, and 2 gamma subunits with two identical nickel porphinoid active sites, which form two long active site channels with F430 embedded at the bottom [[cite:PUB00006391], [cite:PUB00035994]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents the alpha subunit of methyl coenzyme M reductase, also called coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase ([ec:2.8.4.1]).
