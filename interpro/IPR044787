{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant Myb family transcription factors, including HHO1-6, HRS1 and  EFM from Arabidopsis. HRS1 represses primary root development in response to phosphate deficiency conditions, only when nitrate is present [[cite:PUB00097079]]. It is also required for suppressing abscisic acid (ABA) signalling in germinating embryo axis, which promotes the timely germination of seeds [[cite:PUB00097080]]. EFM functions as a flowering repressor, directly repressing FT expression in a dosage-dependent manner in the leaf vasculature [[cite:PUB00097081]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31003" "MYB FAMILY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myb family transcription factor HRS1-like", "short" "HRS1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 252, "taxa" 997, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3372, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3372, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2004}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044787", :literature {"PUB00097079" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Medici A" "Marshall-Colon A" "Ronzier E" "Szponarski W" "Wang R" "Gojon A" "Crawford NM" "Ruffel S" "Coruzzi GM" "Krouk G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "AtNIGT1/HRS1 integrates nitrate and phosphate signals at the Arabidopsis root tip.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "6274", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25723764}, "PUB00097080" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wu C" "Feng J" "Wang R" "Liu H" "Yang H" "Rodriguez PL" "Qin H" "Liu X" "Wang D."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "HRS1 acts as a negative regulator of abscisic acid signaling to promote timely germination of Arabidopsis seeds.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e35764", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22545134}, "PUB00097081" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Yan Y" "Shen L" "Chen Y" "Bao S" "Thong Z" "Yu H."], "ISO_journal" "Dev Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Dev Cell", "title" "A MYB-domain protein EFM mediates flowering responses to environmental cues in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "437-48", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25132385}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044787", "name" "Myb family transcription factor HRS1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
