{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family represent a subgroup of the glutathione-S-transferase (GSTs) superfamily. CLIC proteins can exist as both soluble globular proteins and integral membrane proteins with ion channel function [[cite:PUB00072078]]. Membrane insertion seems to be redox-regulated [[cite:PUB00034628]] and has a strong pH dependence [[cite:PUB00072099]]. CLIC proteins are enigmatic as they do not fit the patterns of other, well-characterised ion channel proteins that show clear and often multiple TM domains [[cite:PUB00072117]]. They share a conserved C-terminal CLIC module, with several members containing additional, unrelated N-terminal domains. CLIC proteins are highly conserved in vertebrates, which usually possess six distinct paralogues (CLIC1-CLIC6) [[cite:PUB00072117]]. They are multifunctional proteins and participate in a wide variety of signaling activities.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ery", "name" "The crystal structure of mouse chloride intracellular channel protein 6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036282", "name" "Glutathione S-transferase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00862" "intracellular chloride channel protein"}, "prints" {"PR01263" "INTCLCHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intracellular chloride channel", "short" "CLIC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 662, "taxa" 2324, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 10316, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5864, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3942}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
