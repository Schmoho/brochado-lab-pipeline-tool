{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Vps41 and Vps8.</p>\n\n<p>Vps41 is a subunit of the homotypic vacuole fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex; essential for membrane docking and fusion at the Golgi-to-endosome and endosome-to-vacuole stages of protein transport [[cite:PUB00053237], [cite:PUB00053238], [cite:PUB00044536]].</p>\n\n<p>Vps8 is one of the Golgi complex components necessary for vacuolar sorting [[cite:PUB00058245]]. Eukaryotic cells contain a highly dynamic endomembrane system, in which individual organelles keep their identity despite continuous vesicle generation and fusion. Vesicles that bud from a donor membrane are targeted and delivered to each individual organelle, where they release their cargo after fusion with the acceptor membrane. Vps8 is the core component of the endosomal tethering complex CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering). Vps8 co-operates with Vps21-GTP to mediate endosomal clustering in a reaction that is dependent on Vps3. Vps8 is the only CORVET subunit that is enriched on late endosomes, suggesting that it is a marker for the maturation of late endosomes. Late endosomes form intraluminal vesicles, and the resulting multivesicular bodies fuse with the vacuole to release their cargoes [[cite:PUB00058246]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12616" "VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING VPS41"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein Vps41/Vps8", "short" "Vps41/Vps8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2633, "taxa" 10853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11908, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11908, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4303}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045111", :literature {"PUB00044536" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Nakamura N" "Hirata A" "Ohsumi Y" "Wada Y."], "ISO_journal" "J.
