{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several alpha conotoxin precursor proteins from a number of Conus species. Cone snail toxins, conotoxins, are small peptides with disulphide connectivity, that target ion-channels or G-protein coupled receptors. Based on the number and pattern of disulphide bonds and biological activities, conotoxins can be classified into several families [[cite:PUB00016617]]. Alpha-conotoxins are neurotoxins from the venom of fish-hunting cone snails that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [[cite:PUB00013117]]. Alpha-conotoxin-like Lv1.4 has analgesic effects in mouse being a potential drug for therapeutic applications [[cite:PUB00097914]]. Omega, delta and kappa families of conotoxins have a knottin or inhibitor cystine knot scaffold. The knottin scaffold is a very special disulphide through disulphide knot, in which the III-VI disulphide bond crosses the macrocycle formed by two other disulphide bonds (I-IV and II-V) and the interconnecting backbone segments, where I-VI indicates the six cysteine residues starting from the N terminus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07365" "Alpha conotoxin precursor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conotoxin, alpha-type", "short" "Conotoxin_a-typ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 130, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 582, "sets" 0, "proteins" 582, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 577}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC60004", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC60004"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009958", :literature {"PUB00016617" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["McIntosh JM" "Jones RM."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0041-0101(01)00145-3", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Cone venom--from accidental stings to deliberate injection.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1447-51", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11478951}, "PUB00016622" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["Balaji RA" "Ohtake A" "Sato K" "Gopalakrishnakone P" "Kini RM" "Seow KT" "Bay BH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
