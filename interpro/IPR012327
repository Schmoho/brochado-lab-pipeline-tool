{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In prokaryotes, the major role of DNA methylation is to protect host DNA against degradation by restriction enzymes. There are 2 major classes of DNA methyltransferase that differ in the nature of the modifications they effect. The members of one class (C-MTases) methylate a ring carbon and form C5-methylcytosine (see [interpro:IPR001525]). Members of the second class (N-MTases) methylate exocyclic nitrogens and form either N4-methylcytosine (N4-MTases) or N6-methyladenine (N6-MTases). Both classes of MTase utilise the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and are active as monomeric enzymes [[cite:PUB00000092]].</p>\n\n<p>N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylases ([ec:2.1.1.72]) (A-Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA. Such enzymes are found in the three existing types of bacterial restriction-modification systems (in type I system the A-Mtase is the product of the hsdM gene, and in type III it is the product of the mod gene). All of these enzymes recognise a specific sequence in DNA and methylate an adenine in that sequence. It has been shown [[cite:PUB00003225], [cite:PUB00001770], [cite:PUB00003245], [cite:PUB00001857]] that A-Mtases contain a conserved motif Asp/Asn-Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe in their N-terminal section, this conserved region could be involved in substrate binding or in the catalytic activity. The structure of N6-MTase TaqI (M.TaqI) has been resolved to 2.4 A [[cite:PUB00004831]]. The molecule folds into 2 domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain, which contains the catalytic and cofactor binding sites, and comprises a central 9-stranded β-sheet, surrounded by 5 helices; and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain, which is formed by 4 small β-sheets and 8 α-helices. The N- and C-terminal domains form a cleft that accommodates the DNA substrate. A classification of N-MTases has been proposed, based on conserved motif (CM) arrangements [[cite:PUB00001857]]. According to this classification, N6-MTases that have a DPPY motif (CM II) occuring after the FxGxG motif (CM I) are designated D12 class N6-adenine MTases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2dpm", "name" "DPNM DNA ADENINE METHYLTRANSFERASE FROM STREPTOCCOCUS PNEUMONIAE COMPLEXED WITH S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023095", "name" "Adenine-specific methyltransferase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30481" "DNA ADENINE METHYLASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00571" "Dam family site-specific DNA-(adenine-N6)-methyltransferase"}, "prints" {"PR00505" "D12N6MTFRASE"}, "pfam" {"PF02086" "D12 class N6 adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D12 class N6 adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase", "short" "MeTrfase_D12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 109, "proteomes" 3555, "taxa" 18961, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29550, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28575, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21298}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
