{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Characterized members of this family include Spx and MgsR from Bacillus subtilis. Spx is a global transcription regulator that plays a key role in stress response and exerts either positive or negative regulation of genes. Induces the expression of a large number of genes in response to a variety of stress conditions, such as disulfide, heat and cell wall stress. It interacts with RNA polymerase [[cite:PUB00057826], [cite:PUB00095599]]. MgsR (modulator of the general stress response, also called YqgZ) provides a second level of regulation for more than a third of the proteins in the B. subtilis general stress regulon controlled by Sigma-B [[cite:PUB00057340]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rw1", "name" "YFFB (PA3664) PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01617" "Spx/MgsR family RNA polymerase-binding regulatory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulator Spx/MgsR", "short" "Tscrpt_reg_Spx/MgsR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4195, "taxa" 17342, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21297, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21297, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16447}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006504", :literature {"PUB00057340" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Reder A" "Hoper D" "Weinberg C" "Gerth U" "Fraunholz M" "Hecker M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
