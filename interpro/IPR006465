{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The name of this type of amylase is based on the characterisation of an glucoamylase family enzyme from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris. The T. vulgaris enzyme was expressed in E. coli and, like other glucoamylases, it releases beta-D-glucose from starch.  However, unlike previously characterised glucoamylases, this T. vulgaris amylase hydrolyzes maltooligosaccharides (maltotetraose, maltose) more efficiently than starch, indicating that it belongs to a class of glucoamylase-type enzymes with oligosaccharide-metabolising activity [[cite:PUB00009730]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012341", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008928", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01577" "oligosaccharide amylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oligosaccharide amylase", "short" "Oligosac_amylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 82, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 54, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 53}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
