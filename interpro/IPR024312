{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TACC proteins are present in different organisms, ranging from yeasts to mammals. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has one TACC protein, known as Alp7 or Mia1p [[cite:PUB00086636]]. Alp7/TACC consists of two domains: the N-terminal half that contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and has no homology to the other TACC members, and the C-terminal half, which consists of the conserved coiled-coil TACC domain [[cite:PUB00045149]]. Alp7/TACC forms a complex with Alp14/TOG and localizes to microtubules, SPBs and kinetochores [[cite:PUB00045149], [cite:PUB00086638]]. This complex is necessary for mitotic and meiotic spindle assembly and proper chromosome segregation [[cite:PUB00086639]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The homologue from S. cerevisiae, Slk19, also has a role in spindle assembly and stability, and it is required for proper chromosome segregation [[cite:PUB00086641], [cite:PUB00086640]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12709" "Fungal Transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TACC protein, fungi", "short" "TACC_fungi"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 736, "taxa" 1938, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1124, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 723}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024312", :literature {"PUB00086640" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zeng X" "Kahana JA" "Silver PA" "Morphew MK" "McIntosh JR" "Fitch IT" "Carbon J" "Saunders WS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
