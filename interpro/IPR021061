{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents mitochondrial division protein 1 (Mdv1), which is a component of the mitochondrial fission machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein is also involved in peroxisome proliferation [[cite:PUB00053318]]. Mdv1 along with Fis1 is also involved in controlling Dnm-1 dependent devision, a GTPase involved in the mediation of mitochondrial division. In this role, Mdv1 is the linker between Fis1 and Dnm1. Mdv1 plays a key role in the regulation of Dnm1 self-assembly [[cite:PUB00053319]].</p>\n\n<p>Mdv1 has a partially redundant function to CAF4 in acting as an adapter protein, binding to FIS1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane and recruiting the dynamin-like GTPase DNM1 to form mitochondrial fission complexes. Formation of these complexes is required to promote constriction and fission of the mitochondrial compartment at a late step in mitochondrial division [[cite:PUB00038450], [cite:PUB00053320]]. Mdv1 interacts with CAF4, DNM1 and FIS1, components of the mitochondrial fission machinery. It interacts via its N-terminal, coiled-coil extension (NTE) with FIS1, and via its WD repeats with DNM1. Mdv1 is uniformly distributed on the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. This localisation is dependent on FIS1. It reorganises to punctate structures on mitochondria, corresponding to mitochondrial constriction sites, at a late step in mitochondrial division. This relocalisation is dependent on DNM1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11542" "Mitochondrial division protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial division protein 1", "short" "Mt_division_protein_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021061", :literature {"PUB00053318" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Nagotu S" "Krikken AM" "Otzen M" "Kiel JA" "Veenhuis M" "van der Klei IJ."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00772.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Peroxisome fission in Hansenula polymorpha requires Mdv1 and Fis1, two proteins also involved in mitochondrial fission.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1471-84", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18513378}, "PUB00053319" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Naylor K" "Ingerman E" "Okreglak V" "Marino M" "Hinshaw JE" "Nunnari J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
