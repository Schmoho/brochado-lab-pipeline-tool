{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HGAL (human germinal centre-associated lymphoma, also known as a germinal centre-expressed transcript 2 or germinal centre-associated signalling and motility protein) is part of a family of mammalian sequences typically between 104 and 179 amino acids in length. Members were discovered in a search for proteins precipitating diffuse large B-cell lymphomas [[cite:PUB00075731], [cite:PUB00075732]]. HGAL and its murine homologue, M17 protein, are specifically expressed in germinal centre (GC) B-lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00075736]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HGAL interacts with the cytoskeleton and aids the activity of interleukin-6 on cell migration [[cite:PUB00075733]]. It also modulates the RhoA signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00075734]]. HGAL protein also regulates B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling [[cite:PUB00075735]]. It seems that membrane-bound and cytoplasmic HGAL regulates distinct biological processes in B-cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15666" "Germinal center-associated lymphoma"}, "panther" {"PTHR35351" "GERMINAL CENTER-ASSOCIATED SIGNALING AND MOTILITY-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Germinal centre-associated lymphoma protein", "short" "GC_assoc_lym"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 122, "taxa" 424, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 290}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031364", :literature {"PUB00075732" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pan Z" "Shen Y" "Du C" "Zhou G" "Rosenwald A" "Staudt LM" "Greiner TC" "McKeithan TW" "Chan WC."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
