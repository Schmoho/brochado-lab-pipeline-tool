{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Retinoic acid receptor responder protein 2 (also known as chemerin or TIG2) is an immunomodulating protein secreted predominantly by adipose tissue and skin. It is secreted in an inactive form and further processed to an active form through cleavage of its carboxyl terminus [[cite:PUB00070460]]. It regulates adipogenesis, metabolism and inflammation through activation of the chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) [[cite:PUB00070455]]. It also binds to G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and C-C chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2) [[cite:PUB00070455]]. Chemerin has been linked to obesity and inflammation. It also possesses antimicrobiological functions and may serve as a tumorsuppressor in skin [[cite:PUB00070455]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15106" "RETINOIC ACID RECEPTOR RESPONDER PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Retinoic acid receptor responder protein 2", "short" "Chemerin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 498, "taxa" 1811, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 935, "sets" 0, "proteins" 935, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 627}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029562", :literature {"PUB00070460" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Zabel BA" "Allen SJ" "Kulig P" "Allen JA" "Cichy J" "Handel TM" "Butcher EC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
