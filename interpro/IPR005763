{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>L-fucose isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.25]) converts the aldose L-fucose into the corresponding ketose L-fuculose during the first step in fucose metabolism using Mn2+ as a cofactor. The enzyme is a hexamer, forming the largest structurally known ketol isomerase, and has no sequence or structural similarity with other ketol isomerases. L-fucose isomerase is composed of three domains, the N-terminal, central and C-terminal domains.  The N-terminal and central domains have a similar topology, consisting of three layers (α/β/α) each.  The N-terminal domain has a parallel β-sheet of five strands in the order S2, S1, S3, S4, S5, while the central domain has a parallel β-sheet of four strands in the order S2, S1, S3, S4 [[cite:PUB00007428]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3a9s", "name" "X-ray Structure of Bacillus pallidus D-Arabinose Isomerase Complex with Glycerol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009015", "name" "L-fucose isomerase, N-terminal/central domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038392", "name" "L-fucose isomerase, domain 2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038393", "name" "L-fucose isomerase, domain 3 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038391", "name" "L-fucose isomerase, domain 1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37840" "L-FUCOSE ISOMERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01254" "L-fucose isomerase [fucI]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01089" "L-fucose isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-fucose isomerase", "short" "Fucose_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1081, "taxa" 5186, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6234, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4798}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0458", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0458"} {"accession" "GenProp1589", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1589"} {"accession" "GenProp1680", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1680"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
