{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ryanodine receptors are involved in communication between transverse-tubules and the sarcoplamic reticulum of cardiac and skeletal muscle. The proteins function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channels following depolarisation of transverse-tubules [[cite:PUB00002638]]. The function is modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg2+, ATP and calmodulin. Deficiency in the ryanodine receptor may be the cause of malignant hyperthermia (MH) and of central core disease of muscle (CCD) [[cite:PUB00001957]]. MH is an autosomal dominant disorder of skeletal muscle and is a principal cause of death due to anaesthesia.</p>\n\n<p>Calcium release activity of the receptors resides in the C-terminal region of the protein, the remaining part of the molecule forming a 'foot' structure that spans the junctional gap between the sarcoplamic reticulum and the transverse-tubule. The foot structure may interact with the cytoplasmic region of the dihydropyridine receptor.</p>\n\n<p>Analysis of the sequence reveals 10 potential transmembrane (TM) regions in the C-terminal fifth of the molecule and 2 further potential TM regions nearer to the centre [[cite:PUB00002597]]. These may contribute to the formation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> conducting pore. The rest of the sequence is hydrophilic, and presumably constitutes the cytoplasmic domain of the protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043136", "name" "B30.2/SPRY domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036300", "name" "Mir domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00795" "RYANODINER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ryanodine receptor", "short" "Ryan_recept"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 193, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 854, "taxa" 3538, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6104, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 346}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013333", :literature {"PUB00002638" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Witcher DR" "Kovacs RJ" "Schulman H" "Cefali DC" "Jones LR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
