{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry specifically represents bacterial YdeI. YdeI is important for resistance to polymyxin B in broth and for bacterial survival in mice upon oral, but not intraperitoneal inoculation, suggesting a role for YdeI in the gastrointestinal tract of mice [[cite:PUB00061992]]. Production of the ydeI gene is regulated by the Rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) phospho-relay system pathway independently of RcsA, and additionally transcription of the protein is regulated by the stationary-phase sigma factor, RpoS (sigma-S) [[cite:PUB00061992]]. YdeI confers protection against cationic AMPs (antimicrobial peptides) or bacteriocins in conjunction with the general porin Omp, thus justifying its name of OmdA, for OmpD-Associated protein [[cite:PUB00061993]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF021308" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP021308 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein YdeI, bacterial", "short" "YdeI_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 933, "taxa" 3564, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3214, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3210, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2425}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016786", :literature {"PUB00061992" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Erickson KD" "Detweiler CS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
