{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Capsid protein (CA1, also known as VP1) self-assembles to form the virion icosahedral capsid with a T=1 symmetry. This very small capsid (25 nm in diameter) allows the virus to be very stable in the environment and resistant to some disinfectants, including detergents. It is essential for the initial attachment to host receptors. After attachment, the virus is endocytosed and traffics to the nucleus. The capsid protein binds and transports the viral genome and Rep across the nuclear envelope [[cite:PUB00062399]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04162" "Gyrovirus capsid protein (VP1)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Capsid protein", "short" "Capsid_protein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 54, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1074, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1062, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007291", :literature {"PUB00062399" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Noteborn MH" "Verschueren CA" "Koch G" "Van der Eb AJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
