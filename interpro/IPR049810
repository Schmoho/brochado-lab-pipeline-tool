{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents  Pyocin S6 toxin immunity protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related proteins mainly from Pseudomonas species. The S6 toxin immunity gene is always found adjacent or close to genes encoding proteins containing ribonuclease domain ([interpro:IPR009105]) of 16S rRNA-cleaving colicin E3 and pyocin S6 family toxins. High basal expression of the immunity gene protects the pyocin-producing cell against invading pyocins, and in addition, ensures that it can rapidly respond to changing conditions [[cite:PUB00105868]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040643" "pyocin S6 family toxin immunity protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyocin S6 toxin immunity protein-like", "short" "S6_alt_immun-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 143, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 258, "sets" 0, "proteins" 257, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 205}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049810", :literature {"PUB00105868" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Dingemans J" "Ghequire MG" "Craggs M" "De Mot R" "Cornelis P."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiologyopen", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiologyopen", "title" "Identification and functional analysis of a bacteriocin, pyocin S6, with ribonuclease activity from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis clinical isolate.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "413-23", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26860427}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049810", "name" "Pyocin S6 toxin immunity protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
