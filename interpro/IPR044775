{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family belong to the Glucose transporter-like (GLUT-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins and consists of sugar transporters including plant early dehydration-induced gene ERD6-like proteins [[cite:PUB00097061]], and similar insect proteins such as facilitated trehalose transporter Tret1-1. ERD6-like transporters can be induced under abiotic stress conditions. EDR6 might transport sucrose, while ESL1 transports monosaccharides across the vacuolar membrane and functions together with the vacuolar invertase to regulate osmotic pressure by affecting the accumulation of sugar in the cells under abiotic stress conditions [[cite:PUB00097061]]. Insect Tret1-1 is a low-capacity facilitative transporter for trehalose that mediates the transport of trehalose synthesised in the fat body and the incorporation of trehalose into other tissues that require a carbon source [[cite:PUB00097056], [cite:PUB00097066]]. Proteins in this family show similarities with mammalian glucose transporters GLUT6/ GLUT8 and myo-inositol transporters (HMIT) [[cite:PUB00097061], [cite:PUB00097066]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17358" "Glucose transporter (GLUT) types 6 and 8, Class 3 GLUTs, and similar transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sugar transporter ERD6/Tret1-like", "short" "MFS_ERD6/Tret1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 477, "taxa" 2377, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7525, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4636}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044775", :literature {"PUB00097056" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kanamori Y" "Saito A" "Hagiwara-Komoda Y" "Tanaka D" "Mitsumasu K" "Kikuta S" "Watanabe M" "Cornette R" "Kikawada T" "Okuda T."], "ISO_journal" "Insect Biochem Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Insect Biochem Mol Biol", "title" "The trehalose transporter 1 gene sequence is conserved in insects and encodes proteins with different kinetic properties involved in trehalose import into peripheral tissues.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "30-7", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20035867}, "PUB00097066" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["Kikawada T" "Saito A" "Kanamori Y" "Nakahara Y" "Iwata K" "Tanaka D" "Watanabe M" "Okuda T."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Trehalose transporter 1, a facilitated and high-capacity trehalose transporter, allows exogenous trehalose uptake into cells.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "11585-90", "volume" "104", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17606922}, "PUB00097061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yamada K" "Osakabe Y" "Mizoi J" "Nakashima K" "Fujita Y" "Shinozaki K" "Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Functional analysis of an Arabidopsis thaliana abiotic stress-inducible facilitated diffusion transporter for monosaccharides.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1138-46", "volume" "285", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19901034}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0051119", "name" "sugar transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0008643", "name" "carbohydrate transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005828", "name" "Major facilitator, sugar transporter-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003663", "name" "Sugar/inositol transporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044775", "name" "Sugar transporter ERD6/Tret1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045262", "name" "Sugar transport protein STP/Polyol transporter PLT, plant", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044776", "name" "Polyol transporter 1-6", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044778", "name" "Sugar transport protein STP/MST-like, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR045263", "name" "Glucose transporter GLUT", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR002439", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 1 (GLUT1)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002440", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 2 (GLUT2)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002441", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 4 (GLUT4)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002442", "name" "Fructose transporter, type 5 (GLUT5)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002945", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 3 (GLUT3)", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR047984", "name" "D-xylose-proton symporter-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR004736", "name" "MFS transporter, metabolite:H symporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004738", "name" "Phosphate permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004749", "name" "Organic cation transport protein/SVOP", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR045915", "name" "Solute carrier family 22 members 4/5", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
