PSI is composed of at least 14 different subunits, two of which are small hydrophobic proteins of about 7 to 9 Kd and evolutionary related, PsaG (also known as PSI-G) and PsaK (also known as PSI-K), both integral membrane proteins. Cyanobacteria contain only PsaK [[cite:PUB00002802]].

Photosystem I (PSI) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated hydrogen donated from PSII to reduce NADP+ to NADPH.
