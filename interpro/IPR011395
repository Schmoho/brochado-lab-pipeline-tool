{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha-glucuronidases belong to an ensemble of enzymes, which are central to the recycling of photosynthetic biomass. To date, all of the alpha-glucuronidases are classified as family 67 glycosidases, which catalyze the hydrolysis via the investing mechanism [[cite:PUB00026672]]. They hydrolyze the alpha1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (4-O-MeGlcA) and the xylan or xylooligosaccharide backbone [[cite:PUB00028600]]. They have three domains, the central of which is a (β/α)(8) barrel, which houses the catalytic apparatus [[cite:PUB00014285]]. The carboxylate and methyl groups of aldobiouronic acid can act as substrate recognition determinants [[cite:PUB00026672]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1l8n", "name" "The 1.5A crystal structure of alpha-D-glucuronidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus T-1, complexed with 4-O-methyl-glucuronic acid and xylotriose"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF029900" "Alpha-glucuronidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha glucuronidase", "short" "Glyco_hydro_67_aGlcAse"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1155, "taxa" 3927, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3054, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2342}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
