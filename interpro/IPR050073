{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of the 2-IPM synthase/homocitrate synthase family are involved in the biosynthesis of essential amino acids, specifically leucine and lysine. They catalyse key condensation reactions in the respective biosynthetic pathways. The 2-isopropylmalate synthases catalyse the formation of 2-isopropylmalate from acetyl-CoA and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, a crucial step in leucine biosynthesis. Homocitrate synthases, on the other hand, catalyse the condensation of 2-oxoglutarate with acetyl-CoA to yield homocitrate, initiating the alpha-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis. Some family members also exhibit activity towards the formation of citramalate from pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. This entry also includes members of the 4-hydroxy 2-ketovalerate aldolase family (also known as 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate aldolase (HOA)) that converts 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate to acetaldehyde and pyruvate, the penultimate step in the meta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of phenols, cresols and catechol. The entry also includes enzymes with regulatory domains that are subject to feedback inhibition by the end products of the pathways, such as leucine and lysine, ensuring the balance of amino acid synthesis in the cell.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3a9i", "name" "Crystal structure of homocitrate synthase from Thermus thermophilus complexed with Lys"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10277" "HOMOCITRATE SYNTHASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-IPM synthase/homocitrate synthase-like", "short" "2-IPM_HCS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7710, "taxa" 30485, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44264, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44264, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33565}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
