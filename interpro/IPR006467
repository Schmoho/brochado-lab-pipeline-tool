{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of bacterial tRNA modifying enzymes, including tRNA-2-methylthio-N(6)-dimethylallyladenosine synthase from \tNatranaerobius thermophilus (MiaB) and Threonylcarbamoyladenosine tRNA methylthiotransferase MtaB from Bacillus subtilis. Members of this family are closely related to MiaB, a modifier of isopentenylated adenosine-37 of certain eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs (see [interpro:IPR006463]). Sequence alignments suggest that these sequences perform the same chemical transformation as MiaB, perhaps on a different (or differently modified) tRNA base substrate [[cite:PUB00009731], [cite:PUB00009728], [cite:PUB00009729]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023404", "name" "Radical SAM, alpha/beta horseshoe", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01579" "tRNA (N(6)-L-threonylcarbamoyladenosine(37)-C(2))-methylthiotransferase MtaB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MiaB-like tRNA modifying enzyme, bacteria", "short" "MiaB-like_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4212, "taxa" 15802, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18079, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18079, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13595}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
