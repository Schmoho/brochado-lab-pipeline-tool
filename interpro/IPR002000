{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins (lamp) [[cite:PUB00002666]] are integral membrane proteins, specific to lysosomes, and whose exact biological function is not yet clear. Structurally, the lamp proteins consist of two internally homologous lysosome-luminal domains separated by a proline-rich hinge region; at the C-terminal extremity there is a transmembrane region (TM) followed by a very short cytoplasmic tail (C). In each of the duplicated domains, there are two conserved disulphide bonds. This structure is schematically represented in the figure below.</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n   +-----+            +-----+         +-----+            +-----+\r\n   |     |            |     |         |     |            |     |\r\n  xCxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxCxxxxxxxx\r\n  +--------------------------++Hinge++--------------------------++TM++C+\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>In mammals, there are two closely related types of lamp: lamp-1 and lamp-2, which form major components of the lysosome membrane.
