{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of various coronavirus matrix proteins which are transmembrane glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00003985]]. The membrane (M) protein is the most abundant structural protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. It is also regarded as the central organiser of coronavirus assembly, interacting with all other major coronaviral structural proteins. M proteins play a critical role in protein-protein interactions (as well as protein-RNA interactions) since virus-like particle (VLP) formation in many CoVs requires only the M and envelope (E) proteins for efficient virion assembly [[cite:PUB00094066]]. Interaction of spike (S) with M is necessary for retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi complex and its incorporation into new virions, but dispensable for the assembly process. Binding of M to nucleocapsid (N) proteins stabilises the nucleocapsid (N protein-RNA complex), as well as the internal core of virions, and, ultimately, promotes completion of viral assembly. Together, M and E protein make up the viral envelope and their interaction is sufficient for the production and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) [[cite:PUB00094065], [cite:PUB00099876]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04202" "Membrane protein [M]"}, "profile" {"PS51927" "Coronavirus membrane (Cov-M) protein profile"}, "pfam" {"PF01635" "Coronavirus M matrix/glycoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "M matrix/glycoprotein, coronavirus", "short" "M_CoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 66, "taxa" 682, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3124, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1009", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1009"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002574", :literature {"PUB00003985" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5961", "authors" ["Armstrong J" "Niemann H" "Smeekens S" "Rottier P" "Warren G."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/308751a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Sequence and topology of a model intracellular membrane protein, E1 glycoprotein, from a coronavirus.", "year" 1984, "raw_pages" "751-2", "volume" "308", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6325918}, "PUB00094066" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ujike M" "Taguchi F."], "ISO_journal" "Viruses", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Viruses", "title" "Incorporation of spike and membrane glycoproteins into coronavirus virions.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1700-25", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25855243}, "PUB00094065" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Schoeman D" "Fielding BC."], "ISO_journal" "Virol.
