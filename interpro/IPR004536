{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The UGA (TGA) codon is normally a termination codon, however it is also used as a selenocysteine (Sec) codon by numerous organisms [[cite:PUB00072493]]. Sec is the 21st amino acid that is inserted into selenoproteins (protein that includes a selenocysteine (Se-Cys) amino acid residue). The synthesis of Sec and its incorporation into proteins requires the activity of a number of proteins, one of which is selenophosphate synthetase (SPS), also known as the SelD gene product [[cite:PUB00014691], [cite:PUB00072494]]. SPS catalises the production of the selenium donor compound monoselenophosphate (MSP) from selenide and ATP. MSP is then used to synthesize Sec from seryl-tRNAs [[cite:PUB00000070]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPS was initially identified in E. coli as the product of the gene selD, one of four essential selenoprotein synthesis genes (selA-D) [[cite:PUB00072494]]. SelC is the tRNA itself, SelD acts as a donor of reduced selenium, SelA modifies a serine residue on SelC into selenocysteine, and SelB is a selenocysteine-specific translation elongation factor. 3' or 5' non-coding elements of mRNA have been found as probable structures for directing selenocysteine incorporation. Later, the selD homologues from eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea were identified [[cite:PUB00014691]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In mammals, two gene products, SPS1 and SPS2 are proposed to be selenophosphate synthetases. SPS1 may be involved in Sec recycling via a selenium salvage pathway, whereas SPS2 may play a role in the synthesis of selenophosphate [[cite:PUB00072496]]. SPS2 is a selenoprotein and could serve as an autoregulator of selenoprotein synthesis [[cite:PUB00014691]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zau", "name" "Crystal structure of an N-terminally truncated selenophosphate synthetase from Aquifex aeolicus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036676", "name" "PurM-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02195" "SelD"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036407" "Selenophosphate synthetase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00476" "selenide, water dikinase SelD"}, "panther" {"PTHR10256" "SELENIDE, WATER DIKINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenophosphate synthetase", "short" "SPS/SelD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4843, "taxa" 20064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21981, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21950, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14289}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0692", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0692"} {"accession" "GenProp1499", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1499"} {"accession" "GenProp0726", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0726"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
