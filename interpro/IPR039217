{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lymphocyte antigen 96 (LY96 or MD-2) is a glycoprotein essential for the innate response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), binds to both LPS and the extracellular domain of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [[cite:PUB00089510]].  LY96 also associates with TLR2, enabling a response to LPS and peptidoglycan from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00089307]].  The structure of LPS-bound LY96 has been solved, showing that the LPS binds in a deep hydrophobic cavity sandwiched by two Î² sheets and that the phosphorylated glucosamine moieties are located at the entrance to the cavity [[cite:PUB00047339]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2e56", "name" "Crystal structure of human MD-2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014756", "name" "Immunoglobulin E-set", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15218" "MD-1, MD-2 - RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lymphocyte antigen 96", "short" "LY96"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 489, "taxa" 1562, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 679, "sets" 0, "proteins" 679, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 516}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039217", :literature {"PUB00089510" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Kennedy MN" "Mullen GE" "Leifer CA" "Lee C" "Mazzoni A" "Dileepan KN" "Segal DM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
