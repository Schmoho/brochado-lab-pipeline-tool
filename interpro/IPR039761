{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bms1p and Tsr1p represent a new family of factors required for ribosome biogenesis. They are each independently required for 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Bms1p, a protein required for pre-rRNA processing, contains an evolutionarily conserved guanine nucleotide-binding (G) domain with five conserved polypeptide loops designated G1 through G5, which form contact sites with the guanine nucleotide or coordinate the Mg(2+) ion. Sequences resembling G1 (consensus [GA]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]; also known as a P-loop), G4 (consensus [NT]-K-x-D), and G5 (consensus S-[AG] are present in all Bms1 proteins, and either fully conform with the consensus or contain, at most, single conservative substitutions. The G2 motif (consensus G-P-[IV]-T) contains a T residue involved in the coordination of the Mg(2+) required for GTP hydrolysis. The G3 motif diverges from the consensus found in G proteins, D-x(2)-G; however, the D residue is replaced with the conserved E residue. In contrast, Tsr1p lacks a P-loop and is not predicted to bind GTP. It functions at a later step of 40S ribosome production, possibly in assembly and/or export of 43S pre-ribosomal subunits to the cytosol [[cite:PUB00013952], [cite:PUB00072547], [cite:PUB00072548]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12858" "RIBOSOME BIOGENESIS PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome biogenesis protein Bms1/Tsr1", "short" "Bms1/Tsr1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 65, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2720, "taxa" 9903, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11603, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7523}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039761", :literature {"PUB00072548" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Gelperin D" "Horton L" "Beckman J" "Hensold J" "Lemmon SK."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355838201013073", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Bms1p, a novel GTP-binding protein, and the related Tsr1p are required for distinct steps of 40S ribosome biogenesis in yeast.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1268-83", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11565749}, "PUB00072547" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Wegierski T" "Billy E" "Nasr F" "Filipowicz W."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355838201012079", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Bms1p, a G-domain-containing protein, associates with Rcl1p and is required for 18S rRNA biogenesis in yeast.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1254-67", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11565748}, "PUB00013952" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Leipe DD" "Wolf YI" "Koonin EV" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
