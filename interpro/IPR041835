{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RabL2s are novel Rab proteins identified recently which display features that are distinct from other Rabs, and have been termed Rab-like. RabL2 contains RabL2a and RabL2b, two very similar Rab proteins that share >98% sequence identity in humans. RabL2b maps to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 22q13.3 and RabL2a maps to 2q13, a region that suggests it is also a subtelomeric gene. Both genes are believed to be expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that RabL2s are the first example of duplicated genes in human proximal subtelomeric regions that are both expressed actively. Like other Rab-like proteins, RabL2s lack a prenylation site at the C terminus [[cite:PUB00091915]]. RabL2 plays an important role in trafficking of ciliary GPCRs at the ciliary base in mammalian cells [[cite:PUB00092538]]. RabL2 has been shown to be involved in male fertility, sperm intra-flagellar transport, and tail assembly [[cite:PUB00091919]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04124" "Rab GTPase-like family 2 (Rab-like2)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab-like protein 2", "short" "RabL2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 254, "taxa" 1050, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 467, "sets" 0, "proteins" 467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 292}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041835", :literature {"PUB00092538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Dateyama I" "Sugihara Y" "Chiba S" "Ota R" "Nakagawa R" "Kobayashi T" "Itoh H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
