{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of fungal transcription factors, including Transcriptional repressor OPI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Transcription factor ccg-8 from Neurospora crassa.</p>\n\n<p>Opi1 is a leucine zipper containing yeast transcription factor that negatively regulates phospholipid biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00033670]].
