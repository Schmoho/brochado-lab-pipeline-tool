{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cobaltochelatase is responsible for the insertion of cobalt into the corrin ring of coenzyme B12 during its biosynthesis. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) can be complexed with metal via ATP-dependent reactions (aerobic pathway) (e.g., in Pseudomonas denitrificans) or via ATP-independent reactions (anaerobic pathway) (e.g., in Salmonella typhimurium) [[cite:PUB00006361], [cite:PUB00011189]]. The corresponding cobalt chelatases are not homologous. The two versions have been well described. CbiK/CbiX is a monomeric, anaerobic version which acts early in the biosynthesis ([pfam:PF06180]). CobNST is a trimeric, ATP-dependent, aerobic version which acts late in the biosynthesis ([ncbifam:TIGR02257]/[ncbifam:TIGR01650]/[ncbifam:TIGR01651]). The two pathways differ in the point of cobalt insertion during corrin ring formation [[cite:PUB00006361]]. There are apparently a number of variations on these two pathways, where the major differences seem to be concerned with the process of ring contraction [[cite:PUB00009744]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of genomes (actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, betaproteobacteria and pseudomonads) which apparently biosynthesise B12, encode a cobN gene but are demonstrably lacking cobS and cobT. These genomes do, however contain a homologue, represented by this entry, of the magnesium chelatase subunits BchI/BchD family. Aside from the cyanobacteria (which have a separate magnesium chelatase trimer), these species do not make chlorins, so do not have any use for a magnesium chelatase. Furthermore, in nearly all cases the members of this family are proximal to either CobN itself or other genes involved in cobalt transport or B12 biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02442" "putative cobaltochelatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cobaltochelatase subunit, putative", "short" "Cob_chelat_sub_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 627, "taxa" 2258, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1832, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1832, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1350}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012804", :literature {"PUB00006361" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Roth JR" "Lawrence JG" "Bobik TA."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
