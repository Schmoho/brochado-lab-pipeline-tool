{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR), also known as glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, catalyses the second step of proline biosynthesis, the NADPH-dependent reversible reduction of gamma-glutamyl phosphate to glutamate-5-semialdehyde as shown below.</p>\n\n<p><reaction>L-glutamyl 5-phosphate + NADPH + H(+) = L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + phosphate + NADP(+)</reaction></p>\n\n<p>In bacteria and yeast, GPR is a monofunctional protein, while in plants and mammals, it is part of a bifunctional enzyme that consists of two domains, an N-terminal glutamate 5-kinase domain ([ec:2.7.2.11]) and a C-terminal GPR domain [[cite:PUB00033269], [cite:PUB00005656], [cite:PUB00004804]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the monofunctional gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase found in bacteria and yeasts. Structural studies indicate that this protein is composed of three domains and belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase structural family [[cite:PUB00029304]]. The first two domains, the catalytic and cofactor binding domains respectively, both form a similar three layered α-β-α fold, and are thought to close around the NADPH and gamma-glutamyl-phosphate ligands upon binding in order to orient a conserved cysteine residue for catalysis. The third domain is the oligomerisation domain which forms an antiparallel β sheet. The biological oligomerisation state of the protein is not currently known, but like most members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family it is expected to be either a dimer or a tetramer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1o20", "name" "Crystal structure of Gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (TM0293) from Thermotoga maritima at 2.00 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000151" "Gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase", "short" "Glu-5-SA_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8864, "taxa" 32871, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35210, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26686}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
