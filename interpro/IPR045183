{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of F-box-like/WD repeat-containing proteins, including Hif2/Sif2 from yeasts, swd3 from fission yeast, Ebi from Drosophila melanogaster, TBL1X /TBL1XR1 from humans and HOS15 from Arabidopsis. Hif2/Sif2 is part of the set3 histone deacetylase complex involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation [[cite:PUB00019472]]. Ebi promotes the degradation of a repressor of neuronal differentiation (Ttk88) and also limits S phase entry [[cite:PUB00098211]].</p>\n\n<p>TBL1X /TBL1XR1 act as a bridge between the corepressor protein and histones by interacting with both of them within the complex. The N terminus of TBL1X interacts with the N termini of both H2B and H4 histones, and the first three C-terminal WD40-repeats of TBL1X interact with the corepressor complex [[cite:PUB00098214]]. TBL1X /TBL1XR1 serve as specific adaptors for the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugating/19S proteasome complex [[cite:PUB00098212]] and are important for both formation and dismantling of the NCOR complex, which is a corepressor complex. Mutations of the TBL1XR1 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, such as spanning from autism spectrum disorders (ASD), West syndrome, schizophrenia (SCZ), intellectual disability [[cite:PUB00098213]].</p>\n\n<p>HOS15 represses genes associated with abiotic stress tolerance through histone deacetylation in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00098214]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1r5m", "name" "Crystal Structure Of The C-Terminal WD40 Domain Of Sif2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22846" "WD40 REPEAT PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F-box-like/WD repeat-containing protein Ebi-like", "short" "Ebi-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2544, "taxa" 10686, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8103, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8103, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4779}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045183", :literature {"PUB00098213" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Mastrototaro G" "Zaghi M" "Massimino L" "Moneta M" "Mohammadi N" "Banfi F" "Bellini E" "Indrigo M" "Fagnocchi G" "Bagliani A" "Taverna S" "Rohm M" "Herzig S" "Sessa A."], "ISO_journal" "Front Cell Dev Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Cell Dev Biol", "title" "TBL1XR1 Ensures Balanced Neural Development Through NCOR Complex-Mediated Regulation of the MAPK Pathway.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "641410", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33708771}, "PUB00098212" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Perissi V" "Aggarwal A" "Glass CK" "Rose DW" "Rosenfeld MG."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A corepressor/coactivator exchange complex required for transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and other regulated transcription factors.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "511-26", "volume" "116", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14980219}, "PUB00019472" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Pijnappel WW" "Schaft D" "Roguev A" "Shevchenko A" "Tekotte H" "Wilm M" "Rigaut G" "Seraphin B" "Aasland R" "Stewart AF."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.207401", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "The S. cerevisiae SET3 complex includes two histone deacetylases, Hos2 and Hst1, and is a meiotic-specific repressor of the sporulation gene program.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2991-3004", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11711434}, "PUB00098214" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zhu J" "Jeong JC" "Zhu Y" "Sokolchik I" "Miyazaki S" "Zhu JK" "Hasegawa PM" "Bohnert HJ" "Shi H" "Yun DJ" "Bressan RA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Involvement of Arabidopsis HOS15 in histone deacetylation and cold tolerance.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "4945-50", "volume" "105", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18356294}, "PUB00098211" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Boulton SJ" "Brook A" "Staehling-Hampton K" "Heitzler P" "Dyson N."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "A role for Ebi in neuronal cell cycle control.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "5376-86", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11032805}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003714", "name" "transcription corepressor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045183", "name" "F-box-like/WD repeat-containing protein Ebi-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
