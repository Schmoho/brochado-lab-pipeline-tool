{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes WD repeat-containing protein 62 (WDR62), a microcephaly-related, microtubule (MT)-associated protein (MAP) that localises to the spindle pole and regulates spindle organisation by recruiting katanin to the spindle pole by forming a complex with TPX2/Aurora A [[cite:PUB00155370], [cite:PUB00155369]]. It has been suggested to be an adaptor protein between its recruiting factor TPX2/Aurora A and the effector katanin to orchestrate the regulation of spindle dynamics. The microtubule-binding affinity of WDR62 is autoinhibited through JNK phosphorylation-induced intramolecular interaction [[cite:PUB00155369]]. It is implicated in the development of the cerebral cortex, influencing both the proliferation and migration of neurons [[cite:PUB00073161], [cite:PUB00073163]]. Additionally, these proteins are involved in the duplication of centrioles, specifically the mother-centriole-dependent process. This function appears to be mediated through the formation of a complex at the centrosome, which sequentially incorporates CEP152, CDK5RAP2, and CEP63, and ultimately recruits CDK2, an enzyme essential for the duplication of centrioles [[cite:PUB00076882]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45589" "WD REPEAT DOMAIN 62, ISOFORM G"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein 62", "short" "WDR62"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1616, "taxa" 5602, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3871, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3871, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1547}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052779", :literature {"PUB00073161" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7312", "authors" ["Bilguvar K" "Ozturk AK" "Louvi A" "Kwan KY" "Choi M" "Tatli B" "Yalnizoglu D" "Tuysuz B" "Caglayan AO" "Gokben S" "Kaymakcalan H" "Barak T" "Bakircioglu M" "Yasuno K" "Ho W" "Sanders S" "Zhu Y" "Yilmaz S" "Dincer A" "Johnson MH" "Bronen RA" "Kocer N" "Per H" "Mane S" "Pamir MN" "Yalcinkaya C" "Kumandas S" "Topcu M" "Ozmen M" "Sestan N" "Lifton RP" "State MW" "Gunel M."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09327", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Whole-exome sequencing identifies recessive WDR62 mutations in severe brain malformations.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "207-10", "volume" "467", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20729831}, "PUB00076882" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kodani A" "Yu TW" "Johnson JR" "Jayaraman D" "Johnson TL" "Al-Gazali L" "Sztriha L" "Partlow JN" "Kim H" "Krup AL" "Dammermann A" "Krogan NJ" "Walsh CA" "Reiter JF."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07519", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Centriolar satellites assemble centrosomal microcephaly proteins to recruit CDK2 and promote centriole duplication.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26297806}, "PUB00155369" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Huang J" "Liang Z" "Guan C" "Hua S" "Jiang K."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202007167", "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "WDR62 regulates spindle dynamics as an adaptor protein between TPX2/Aurora A and katanin.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e202007167", "volume" "220", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34137789}, "PUB00073163" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Yu TW" "Mochida GH" "Tischfield DJ" "Sgaier SK" "Flores-Sarnat L" "Sergi CM" "Topcu M" "McDonald MT" "Barry BJ" "Felie JM" "Sunu C" "Dobyns WB" "Folkerth RD" "Barkovich AJ" "Walsh CA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
