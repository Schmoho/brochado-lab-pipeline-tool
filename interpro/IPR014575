{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the type III secretion protein EspD. The pathogenesis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) involves the translocation of effector proteins by the type III secretion system into the host cell, including translocated intimin receptor (Tir) and several E. coli secreted proteins (Esp). Secretion of virulence proteins of EPEC is tightly regulated. CesD is the type III chaperone for the translocator proteins EspB and EspD [[cite:PUB00053423]]. The translocation of virulence proteins into host cells results in attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, actin rearrangements and pedestal formation [[cite:PUB00053424]]. The translocator and effector proteins facilitate colonization of the mucosal surface of the intestine via formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF033018" "Predicted secreted protein EspD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system, secreted protein EspD", "short" "T3SS_EspD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 36, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 51, "sets" 0, "proteins" 51, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014575", :literature {"PUB00053423" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Neves BC" "Mundy R" "Petrovska L" "Dougan G" "Knutton S" "Frankel G."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
