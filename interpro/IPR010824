{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of uncharacterised bacterial proteins predominantly found in Proteobacteria, including YcfL from Escherichia coli and Putative lipoprotein from Campylobacter jejuni. The protein adopts a single domain configuration with two β-sheets formed respectively by three and four β-strands (β-sandwich) and contains a Greek key motif, representing a singular variant of the Ig-like fold. Many proteins of this group have a lipid attachment site at the N-terminal of this domain, which together with the structure solved, suggests a role in bacterial lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00100676]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gio", "name" "Crystal structure of Campylobacter jejuni cj0090"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038483", "name" "YcfL-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07233" "Protein of unknown function (DUF1425)"}, "cdd" {"cd09030" "Putative periplasmic lipoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1425", "short" "DUF1425"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 412, "taxa" 3158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3142, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3142, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2380}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010824", :literature {"PUB00100676" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Paek S" "Kawai F" "Choi KJ" "Yeo HJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of the Campylobacter jejuni Cj0090 protein reveals a novel variant of the immunoglobulin fold among bacterial lipoproteins.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "2804-9", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22987763}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010824", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1425", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 31, "alignment:full" 406}}}
