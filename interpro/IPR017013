{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A member of this family of archaeal proteins has been characterised. Saci_0177 ([swissprot:Q4JC83]) encodes a protein previously known as RecJ, which has been renamed as Cdc45 based on its relationship to eukaryotic Cdc45 [[cite:PUB00083143], [cite:PUB00083144]]. Cdc45 may form a constitutive complex with GINS. This CG complex associates with the MCM complex at replication origins and during replication fork progression, and stimulates its helicase activity  [[cite:PUB00083145]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF032968" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP032968 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Archaeal Cdc45", "short" "Arc_Cdc45"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017013", :literature {"PUB00083143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Sanchez-Pulido L" "Ponting CP."], "ISO_journal" "Bioinformatics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr332", "medline_journal" "Bioinformatics", "title" "Cdc45: the missing RecJ ortholog in eukaryotes?", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1885-8", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21653514}, "PUB00083144" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Makarova KS" "Koonin EV" "Kelman Z."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
