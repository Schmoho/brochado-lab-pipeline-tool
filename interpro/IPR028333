Evidence suggests that, in prokaryotes, the peptidyl transferase reaction is performed by the large subunit 23S rRNA, whereas proteins probably have a greater role in eukaryotic ribosomes. Most of the proteins lie close to, or on the surface of, the 30S subunit, arranged peripherally around the rRNA [[cite:PUB00003381]]. The small subunit ribosomal proteins can be categorised as primary binding proteins, which bind directly and independently to 16S rRNA; secondary binding proteins, which display no specific affinity for 16S rRNA, but its assembly is contingent upon the presence of one or more primary binding proteins; and tertiary binding proteins, which require the presence of one or more secondary binding proteins and sometimes other tertiary binding proteins. The small ribosomal subunit protein uS17 is known to bind specifically to the 5' end of 16S ribosomal RNA in Escherichia coli (primary rRNA binding protein), and is thought to be involved in the recognition of termination codons. Experimental evidence [[cite:PUB00004907]] has revealed that uS17 has virtually no groups exposed on the ribosomal surface.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8glp", "name" "mRNA decoding in human is kinetically and structurally distinct from bacteria (Consensus LSU focused refined structure)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03630" "30S ribosomal protein S17"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS17, archaeal/eukaryotic", "short" "Ribosomal_uS17_arc/euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 515, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2519, "taxa" 10204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7059, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5190}, "pathways" 83}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028333", :literature {"PUB00004907" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Agafonov DE" "Kolb VA" "Spirin AS."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
