{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>C2CD5, also known as CDP138 or KIAA0528, is a C2 domain-containing phosphoprotein. It is a substrate for protein kinase Akt2, and it may be involved in the regulation of GLUT4 vesicle-plasma membrane fusion in response to insulin. The C2 domain of C2CD5 was shown to be capable of binding Ca(2+) and lipid membranes [[cite:PUB00068956]]. Other studies indicate that C2CD5 is a CDK5- and FIBP-interacting protein, forming a complex with these proteins that is involved in cell proliferation and migration [[cite:PUB00087624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37412" "C2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C2 domain-containing protein 5", "short" "C2CD5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1117, "taxa" 4496, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4052, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4052, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2218}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038983", :literature {"PUB00068956" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Xie X" "Gong Z" "Mansuy-Aubert V" "Zhou QL" "Tatulian SA" "Sehrt D" "Gnad F" "Brill LM" "Motamedchaboki K" "Chen Y" "Czech MP" "Mann M" "Kruger M" "Jiang ZY."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Metab.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2011.06.015", "medline_journal" "Cell Metab", "title" "C2 domain-containing phosphoprotein CDP138 regulates GLUT4 insertion into the plasma membrane.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "378-89", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21907143}, "PUB00087624" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Xu S" "Li X" "Gong Z" "Wang W" "Li Y" "Nair BC" "Piao H" "Yang K" "Wu G" "Chen J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
