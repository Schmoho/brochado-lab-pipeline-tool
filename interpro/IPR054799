{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents nicotine blue oxidoreductase from Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans (NboR) and similar sequences from actinomycetes. NboR catalyses the reduction of nicotine blue to its hydroquinone form. Nicotine blue is the name given to the compound formed by the autocatalytic condensation of two molecules of 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine, an intermediate in the nicotine degradation pathway [[cite:PUB00154649]]. NboR may play a role in preventing the intracellular formation of nicotine blue semiquinone radicals, which by redox cycling would lead to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species. Besides nicotine blue, several other quinones are reduced by this enzyme.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045782" "nicotine blue oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nicotine blue oxidoreductase", "short" "NboR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 105, "sets" 0, "proteins" 105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 86}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
