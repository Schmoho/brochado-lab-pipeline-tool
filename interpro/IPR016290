{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents S-Adenosylmethionine lyases ([ec:3.3.1.2]), which catalyse the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, cleaving it to form L-homoserine and methylthioadenosine. This enzyme is produced by Bacteriophage T3, which infects Escherichia coli cells. SAM hydrolase can remove S-adenosylmethionine from the E. coli cell, thereby inhibiting a variety of SAM-related activities, such as dam and dcm methylase-directed DNA modifications and the synthesis of spermidine from putrescine [[cite:PUB00042741]]. It inhibits the host S-adenosylmethionine synthase METK/MAT which prevents methylation of the viral genome [[cite:PUB00101354], [cite:PUB00101355]]. Expression of SAM hydrolase in T3-transformed E. coli induces the met regulon by cleaving the SAM co-repressor to form 5'-methylthioadenosine, which is then cleaved to produce 5-methylthioribose [[cite:PUB00042742]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001110" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-Adenosylmethionine lyase", "short" "S-AdoMet_lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 28, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
