{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases ([ec:1.2.1.3] and [ec:1.2.1.5]) are enzymes which oxidize a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes using NAD(P) as a cofactor. In eukaryotes, at least twenty distinct aldehyde dehydrogenase families have been classified [[cite:PUB00033217]]. Many aldehyde dehydrogenases have also been found in prokaryotic species. A glutamic acid and a cysteine residue have been implicated in the catalytic activity of mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase, though these residues are not necessarily conserved in all the enzymes of this family.</p>\n\n<p>The acetaldehyde dehydrogenase family ([ec:1.2.1.10]) of bacterial enzymes catalyse the formation of acetyl-CoA from acetaldehyde in the degradation of phenols, cresols and catechol [[cite:PUB00033864]]. Proteins in this entry occur in bacterial species and are annotated as probable acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, though this function has not been experimentally verified.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3k9d", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF PROBABLE ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE FROM Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02518" "acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetylating", "short" "Acetaldehyde_DH_acetylating"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 307, "taxa" 1456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1370, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1370, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1029}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0294", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0294"} {"accession" "GenProp0292", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0292"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013357", :literature {"PUB00033217" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Vasiliou V" "Pappa A" "Petersen DR."], "ISO_journal" "Chem.
