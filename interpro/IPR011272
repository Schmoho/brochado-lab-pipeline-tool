{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of protist (Trichomonad) lactate dehydrogenases which have apparently evolved from a recent protist malate dehydrogenase ancestor [[cite:PUB00013776]]. Lactate dehydrogenase converts the hydroxyl at C-2 of lactate to a carbonyl in the product, pyruvate. The preference of this enzyme for NAD or NADP has not been determined. A critical residue in malate dehydrogenase, arginine-91 (Trichomonas vaginalis numbering) has been mutated to a leucine, eliminating the positive charge which complemented the carboxylate in malate which is absent in lactate. Several other more subtle changes are proposed to make the active site smaller to accommodate the less bulky lactate molecule [[cite:PUB00013776]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4uul", "name" "Apo trichomonas vaginalis lactate dehydrogenase L91R"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015955", "name" "Lactate dehydrogenase/glycoside hydrolase, family 4, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01756" "lactate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lactate dehydrogenase, protist", "short" "Lactate_DH_protist"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 19, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011272", :literature {"PUB00013776" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Wu G" "Fiser A" "ter Kuile B" "Sali A" "Muller M."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
