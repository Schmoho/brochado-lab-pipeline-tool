{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>YukD adopts a ubiquitin-like fold [[cite:PUB00035494]]. Usually, ubiquitin covalently binds to protein and flags them for protein degradation; however conjugation assays have indicated that the classical YukD lacks the capacity for covalent bond formation with other proteins [[cite:PUB00035494]]. In firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria), the YukD-like proteins are standalone versions and the YukD-like family is associated in conserved gene neighbourhoods with members of the ESAT-6 export pathway\n(also called Type VII secretion system or ESX), suggesting a role for YukD in regulating this export system [[cite:PUB00034476], [cite:PUB00055111]]. In actinobacteria, YukD-like proteins are often fused to a transporter involved in the ESAT-6/ESX secretion pathway [[cite:PUB00034476], [cite:PUB00057262]]. Members of the YukD family are also associated in gene neighbourhoods with other enzymatic members of the ubiquitin signaling and degradation pathway such as the E1, E2 and E3 trienzyme complex that catalyse ubiquitin transfer to substrates, and the JAB family metallopeptidases that are involved in its release [[cite:PUB00057262]]. This suggests that a subset of the YukD family in bacteria are conjugated to target proteins and released from proteins as in the eukaryotic ubiquitin-mediated signaling and degradation pathway [[cite:PUB00057262]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4kv2", "name" "Ubiquitin-like domain of the mycobacterium tuberculosis type VII secretion system protein ECCD1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08817" "WXG100 protein secretion system (Wss), protein YukD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YukD-like", "short" "YukD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 1464, "taxa" 4876, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7569, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7567, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5792}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0905", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0905"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024962", :literature {"PUB00035494" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["van den Ent F" "Lowe J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2005.06.002", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Crystal structure of the ubiquitin-like protein YukD from Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3837-41", "volume" "579", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15978580}, "PUB00034476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-7-r60", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The prokaryotic antecedents of the ubiquitin-signaling system and the early evolution of ubiquitin-like beta-grasp domains.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "R60", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16859499}, "PUB00057262" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Burroughs AM" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1mb05061c", "medline_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "title" "Functional diversification of the RING finger and other binuclear treble clef domains in prokaryotes and the early evolution of the ubiquitin system.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "2261-77", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21547297}, "PUB00055111" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Burts ML" "DeDent AC" "Missiakas DM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
