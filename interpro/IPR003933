{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The epithelial membrane proteins (EMP-1, -2 and -3), peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), and lens fibre membrane intrinsic protein (LMIP) comprise a protein family on the basis of sequence and structural similarities [[cite:PUB00002934]]. Each family member is a small hydrophobic membrane glycoprotein, ~160-170 amino acids in length, and shares a common predicted transmembrane (TM) topology of 4 TM domains, with intracellular N- and C-termini [[cite:PUB00008831]].</p>\r\n<p>A role for the EMP family members in the control of cell growth has been suggested [[cite:PUB00002934]]. EMP-1 is expressed at high levels in proliferating cells, and at reduced levels in cells undergoing growth arrest [[cite:PUB00001869]]. In contrast, PMP22, which is co-expressed with EMP-1 in a range of tissues, displays an inverse pattern of regulation, with high levels of expression in cultured cells undergoing growth arrest [[cite:PUB00001869]]. It has therefore been proposed that these proteins may have reciprocal functions in the control of cell quiescence and proliferation.</p>\r\n<p>EMP-2, previously termed XMP, was identified by expressed sequence tag (EST) database searching, pursuing sequences similar to EMP-1 [[cite:PUB00008842]]. Mus musculus (Mouse) and Homo sapiens (Human) isoforms have been cloned. EMP-2 is expressed in a range of tissues, including ovary, heart, lung and intestine. Although its function has not been elucidated, it has been postulated that EMP-2 may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation on the basis of its sequence similarity to EMP-1 [[cite:PUB00008842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01455" "EPMEMPROT2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Epithelial membrane protein 2", "short" "EMP-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 560, "taxa" 1853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2549, "sets" 0, "proteins" 675, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 514}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003933", :literature {"PUB00002934" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Taylor V" "Welcher AA" "Program AE" "Suter U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
