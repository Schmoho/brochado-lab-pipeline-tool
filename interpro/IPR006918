{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the COBRA family proteins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, members of the family are all extracellular glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins (GPI-linked)  [[cite:PUB00044727]]. COBRA  is involved in determining the orientation of cell expansion, probably by playing an important role in cellulose deposition. It may act by recruiting cellulose synthesizing complexes to discrete positions on the cell surface. Some members of this family are annotated as phytochelatin synthase, but these annotations are incorrect [[cite:PUB00044728]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31673" "PROTEIN COBRA"}, "pfam" {"PF04833" "COBRA-like protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF038122" "COBRA protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "COBRA, plant", "short" "COBRA_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 111, "proteomes" 252, "taxa" 1013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5838, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5496, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3320}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006918", :literature {"PUB00044728" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Rea PA" "Vatamaniuk OK" "Rigden DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.104.048579", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Weeds, worms, and more.
