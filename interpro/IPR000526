{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Auxin binding protein is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The primary structure contains an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence of 30-40 amino acids, which could represent a signal for translocation of the protein to the ER [[cite:PUB00001170], [cite:PUB00004518]]. The mature protein comprises around 165 residues, and contains a number of potential N-glycosylation sites. In vitro transport studies have demonstrated co-translational glycosylation [[cite:PUB00004518]]. Retention within the lumen of the ER correlates with an additional signal located at the C terminus, represented by the sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, known to be responsible for preventing secretion of proteins from the lumen of the ER in eukaryotic cells [[cite:PUB00001170], [cite:PUB00004518]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1lr5", "name" "Crystal structure of auxin binding protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37236" "AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1"}, "prints" {"PR00655" "AUXINBINDNGP"}, "pfam" {"PF02041" "Auxin binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Auxin-binding protein", "short" "Auxin-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 297, "taxa" 1530, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1066, "sets" 0, "proteins" 990, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 665}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000526", :literature {"PUB00001170" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hesse T" "Feldwisch J" "Balshusemann D" "Bauw G" "Puype M" "Vandekerckhove J" "Lobler M" "Klambt D" "Schell J" "Palme K."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=2555179&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Molecular cloning and structural analysis of a gene from Zea mays (L.) coding for a putative receptor for the plant hormone auxin.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "2453-61", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2555179}, "PUB00004518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Palme K" "Hesse T" "Campos N" "Garbers C" "Yanofsky MF" "Schell J."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.4.2.193", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Molecular analysis of an auxin binding protein gene located on chromosome 4 of Arabidopsis.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "193-201", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1321684}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010011", "name" "auxin binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000526", "name" "Auxin-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 430}}}
