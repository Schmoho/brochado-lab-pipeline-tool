{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family is found in archaea and eukaryota. Proteins in this family contain a predicted DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00008047]] and may function as DNA-binding proteins. Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum MTH1615 was predicted to bind DNA based on structural proteomics data, and this was confirmed by the demonstration that it can interact non-specifically with a randomly chosen 20-mer of double stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00008047]]. This suggests that the human protein may be involved in nucleic acid binding or metabolism.</p>\n\n<p>The human programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5, also known as TFAR19) encodes a protein which shares significant homology to the corresponding proteins of species ranging from yeast to mice. PDCD5 exhibits a ubiquitous expression pattern and its expression is up-regulated in the tumour cells undergoing apoptosis. PDCD5 may play a general role in the apoptotic process [[cite:PUB00006429], [cite:PUB00048246]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6iqc", "name" "Wild-type Programmed Cell Death 5 protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036883", "name" "PDCD5-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015730" "DNA-binding protein, TFAR19 type"}, "panther" {"PTHR10840" "PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH PROTEIN 5"}, "pfam" {"PF01984" "Double-stranded DNA-binding domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PDCD5-like", "short" "PDCD5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 77, "proteomes" 2817, "taxa" 10891, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7439, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7410, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5508}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002836", :literature {"PUB00008047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Christendat D" "Yee A" "Dharamsi A" "Kluger Y" "Savchenko A" "Cort JR" "Booth V" "Mackereth CD" "Saridakis V" "Ekiel I" "Kozlov G" "Maxwell KL" "Wu N" "McIntosh LP" "Gehring K" "Kennedy MA" "Davidson AR" "Pai EF" "Gerstein M" "Edwards AM" "Arrowsmith CH."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
