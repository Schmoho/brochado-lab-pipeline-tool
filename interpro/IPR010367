{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents G3 from Vaccinia virus, also called Entry-fusion complex protein OPG086, and similar proteins from poxvirus. G3 is a component of the entry fusion complex (EFC), which consists of 11 proteins. During cell infection, this complex mediates entry of the virion core into the host cytoplasm by a two-step mechanism consisting of lipid mixing of the viral and cellular membranes and subsequent pore formation [[cite:PUB00034709], [cite:PUB00103595]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ytu", "name" "Crystal structure of vaccinia virus G3/L5 sub-complex (SeMet-labeled, P31 space group)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06129" "Chordopoxvirus G3 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus G3", "short" "Poxvirus_G3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 39, "taxa" 195, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 141, "sets" 0, "proteins" 141, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010367", :literature {"PUB00103595" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Schin AM" "Diesterbeck US" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Insights into the Organization of the Poxvirus Multicomponent Entry-Fusion Complex from Proximity Analyses in Living Infected Cells.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e0085221", "volume" "95", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34076488}, "PUB00034709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "51", "authors" ["Senkevich TG" "Ojeda S" "Townsley A" "Nelson GE" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
