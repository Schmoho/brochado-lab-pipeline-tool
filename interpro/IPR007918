{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of small highly conserved proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) the gene YKL053C-A (MDM35) [swissprot:O60200] is one of the genes essential for maintenance of normal mitochondrial distribution and morphology (MDM) [[cite:PUB00033261]]; wherease in Homo sapiens (Human), p53CSV, [swissprot:O43715] is a direct transcriptional target for p53 and appears to be a cell-survival mediator in response to genotoxic stress including low-levels of DNA damage. It is suggested that p53CSV modulates the apoptotic pathway through interaction with HSP70 and Apaf-1 thereby inhibiting activation of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 [[cite:PUB00033262]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xiz", "name" "Structure of a phospholipid trafficking complex with substrate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46403" "TP53-REGULATED INHIBITOR OF APOPTOSIS 1"}, "pfam" {"PF05254" "Uncharacterised protein family (UPF0203)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial distribution/morphology family 35/apoptosis", "short" "MDM35_apoptosis"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 52, "proteomes" 2138, "taxa" 7335, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3296, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3284, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2177}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007918", :literature {"PUB00033261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Dimmer KS" "Fritz S" "Fuchs F" "Messerschmitt M" "Weinbach N" "Neupert W" "Westermann B."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
