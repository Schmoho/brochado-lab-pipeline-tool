{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Actin filaments have an intrinsic polarity, each with a fast-growing (barbed) end and a slow-growing (pointed) end. The slow-growing end is regulated by tropomodulins, a family of capping proteins that require tropomyosins for optimal function [[cite:PUB00071747]]. Tropomyosins contains two domains: an N-terminal unstructured tropomyosin-binding region which has an actin pointed-end-capping activity, an C-terminal region that contains one compact domain represented by alternating α-helices and β-structures [[cite:PUB00071747]]. The tropomyosin-independent actin-capping site is located at the C terminus [[cite:PUB00071747]]. The structure of tropomyosin-1 has been solved [[cite:PUB00071750]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry include Tropomodulin (TMOD)-1/2/3/4 and Leiomodin (LMOD)-1/2/3.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1io0", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF TROPOMODULIN C-TERMINAL HALF"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03250" "Tropomodulin"}, "panther" {"PTHR10901" "TROPOMODULIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tropomodulin", "short" "TMOD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 47, "proteomes" 1060, "taxa" 4585, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8600, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5794}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004934", :literature {"PUB00071747" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Kostyukova AS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry Mosc.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0006297908130075", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry (Mosc)", "title" "Capping complex formation at the slow-growing end of the actin filament.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1467-72", "volume" "73", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19216712}, "PUB00071750" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6195", "authors" ["Rao JN" "Madasu Y" "Dominguez R."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1256159", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Actin cytoskeleton.
