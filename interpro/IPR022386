{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes across the cytoplasmic membrane.

In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Members of this protein family include the substrate-binding protein diacetylchitobiose binding protein NgcE.
