{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Neurotransmitter ligand-gated ion channels are transmembrane receptor-ion channel complexes that open transiently upon binding of specific ligands, allowing rapid transmission of signals at chemical synapses [[cite:PUB00002675], [cite:PUB00003455]]. Five of these ion channel receptor families have been shown to form a sequence-related superfamily:</p>\r\n\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR), an excitatory cation channel in vertebrates and invertebrates; in vertebrate motor endplates it is composed of alpha, beta, gamma and delta/epsilon subunits; in neurons it is composed of alpha and non-alpha (or beta) subunits [[cite:PUB00044612]].</li>\r\n<li>Glycine receptor, an inhibitory chloride ion channel composed of alpha and beta subunits [[cite:PUB00044613]].</li>\r\n<li>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, an inhibitory chloride ion channel; at least four types of subunits (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) are known [[cite:PUB00044614]].</li>\r\n<li>Serotonin 5HT3 receptor, of which there are seven major types (5HT3-5HT7) [[cite:PUB00010340]].</li>\r\n<li>Glutamate receptor, an excitatory cation channel of which at least three types have been described (kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and quisqualate) [[cite:PUB00044615]].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These receptors possess a pentameric structure (made up of varying subunits), surrounding a central pore. All known sequences of subunits from neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels are structurally related. They are composed of a large extracellular glycosylated N-terminal ligand-binding domain, followed by three hydrophobic transmembrane regions which form the ionic channel, followed by an intracellular region of variable length. A fourth hydrophobic region is found at the C-terminal of the sequence [[cite:PUB00002675], [cite:PUB00003455]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is widely distributed in both the central and peripheral nervous system, where it acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator [[cite:PUB00010418]]. It has been implicated in several aspects of brain function, including regulation of affective states, ingestive behavior and addiction. 5-HT can activate a number of different receptor subtypes that produce diverse neuronal responses, principally through activation of G-protein-mediated signalling pathways. Signalling through the 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) differs, since this subtype belongs to the ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) superfamily, which also includes the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid type A and glycine receptors, and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) [[cite:PUB00010386]]. 5-HT3 receptor function has been implicated in a variety of neural processes, including pain perception, emesis, anxiety and drug abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Like the other members of the LGIC superfamily, the 5HT3R exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity, and therefore putative structural similarity, with nAChRs [[cite:PUB00010340]]. Thus, functional 5HT3Rs comprise a pentamer: the ion channel is formed at the centre of a rosette formed between five homologous subunits. Two classes of 5-HT3R subunit are currently known, termed 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B. Whilst homomeric pentamers of 5-HT3A form functional receptors, heteromeric assemblies display channel conductances, cation permeabilities and current-voltage relationships typical of characterised neuronal 5-HT3 channels [[cite:PUB00010338]].</p>\n\n<p>The proposed topology of 5-HT3R subunits comprises four putative transmembrane (TM) domains (designated M1-4); a large extracellular N-terminal region (~200 amino acids); and a variable cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4. The M2 domains from each subunit are thought to form the channel pore. The agonist binding site is formed by the N terminus, which, on binding, induces a conformational change in the channel pore, a process often referred to as \"gating\" [[cite:PUB00010368]]. Opening of the pore allows cation flux through the neuronal membrane and depolarises the membrane potential. Thus, 5-HT3Rs may be thought of as excitatory receptors [[cite:PUB00010347]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Whilst it was initially thought that 5-HT3Rs comprised a homopentamer of alpha subunits, the channel conductance and permeability to anions was different in homomeric receptors from that observed in native channels. More recently, another 5-HT3 receptor subunit, 5-HT3B, was identified and cloned from a human brain cDNA library [[cite:PUB00010338]]. This subunit was unable to form functional channels when expressed alone in oocytes, but produced functional receptors when injected with 5-HT3A into the same cell. It is thought that 5HT3B contributes towards tissue-specific functional changes in 5-HT3-mediated signalling [[cite:PUB00010356]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036719", "name" "Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channel transmembrane domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036734", "name" "Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channel ligand-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01710" "5HT3BRECEPTR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor, B subunit", "short" "5HT3_rcpt_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 105, "taxa" 379, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 466, "sets" 0, "proteins" 163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 97}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008134", :literature {"PUB00010368" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Dang H" "England PM" "Farivar SS" "Dougherty DA" "Lester HA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
