{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Cysteine and histidine-rich domain-containing protein 1 (CHRD1) and its orthologue from Drosophila, morgana, which contain a CHORD (cysteine- and histidine-rich) domain. CHRD1/Morgana regulate centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle dynamics [[cite:PUB00090099], [cite:PUB00155137]] and it also involved in controlling the size of dendritic arbors [[cite:PUB00155136]]. Morgana may act as co-chaperone for Hsp83 [[cite:PUB00155137]], while CHRD1 may act as co-chaperone for HSP90 [[cite:PUB00090099]]. CHRD1 plays a role in ensuring the localisation of the tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR to the plasma membrane, and thus ensures the subsequent regulation of EGFR activity and EGF-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling [[cite:PUB00155138]]. This entry also includes Integrin beta-1-binding protein 2, also known as Melusin and CHORDC3, which may play a role during maturation and/or organisation of muscles cells [[cite:PUB00090101]].</p>\n\n<p>CHORDs are 60-amino acid modules that bind two zinc ions. They are usually arranged in tandem and are found in all tested eukaryotes, with the exception of yeast, where they are involved in processes ranging from pressure sensing in the heart to maintenance of diploidy in fungi, and exhibit distinct protein-protein interaction specificity. Six cysteine and two histidine residues are invariant within the CHORD domain. Three other residues are also invariant and some positions are confined to positive, negative, or aromatic amino acids [[cite:PUB00008722], [cite:PUB00052587]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46983" "CYSTEINE AND HISTIDINE-RICH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine and histidine-rich domain-containing protein 1", "short" "CHRD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2152, "taxa" 7129, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4802, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4802, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3189}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039790", :literature {"PUB00008722" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Shirasu K" "Lahaye T" "Tan MW" "Zhou F" "Azevedo C" "Schulze-Lefert P."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81522-6", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A novel class of eukaryotic zinc-binding proteins is required for disease resistance signaling in barley and development in C. elegans.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "355-66", "volume" "99", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10571178}, "PUB00052587" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Heise CT" "Le Duff CS" "Boter M" "Casais C" "Airey JE" "Leech AP" "Amigues B" "Guerois R" "Moore GR" "Shirasu K" "Kleanthous C."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi062174k", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Biochemical characterization of RAR1 cysteine- and histidine-rich domains (CHORDs): a novel class of zinc-dependent protein-protein interaction modules.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1612-23", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17279625}, "PUB00155138" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haag A" "Walser M" "Henggeler A" "Hajnal A."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50986", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "The CHORD protein CHP-1 regulates EGF receptor trafficking and signaling in <i>C. elegans</i> and in human cells.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "e50986", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32053105}, "PUB00090099" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ferretti R" "Palumbo V" "Di Savino A" "Velasco S" "Sbroggio M" "Sportoletti P" "Micale L" "Turco E" "Silengo L" "Palumbo G" "Hirsch E" "Teruya-Feldstein J" "Bonaccorsi S" "Pandolfi PP" "Gatti M" "Tarone G" "Brancaccio M."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
