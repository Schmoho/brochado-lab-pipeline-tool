{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the endonuclease 8  (also known as Nei) enzyme involved in base excision repair of DNA damaged by oxidation or by mutagenic agents. Endonuclease 8 acts as DNA glycosylase [[cite:PUB00055088]]  that recognises and removes damaged bases [[cite:PUB00055087]]. The enzyme has a preference for oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, 5,6-dihydrouraciland 5,6-dihydrothymine. It also has AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity and introduces nicks in the DNA strand.The enzyme binds 1 zinc ion per subunit and acts by cleaving the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand-break at the site of the removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. The C-O-P bond 3' to the apurinic orapyrimidinic site in DNA which is broken by the beta-elimination reaction leaves a 3'-terminal unsaturated sugar and a product with a terminal 5'-phosphate. This enzyme belongs to the FPG family and contains 1 FPG-type zinc finger [[cite:PUB00037432]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1k3x", "name" "Crystal structure of a trapped reaction intermediate of the DNA repair enzyme Endonuclease VIII with Brominated-DNA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01253" "Endonuclease 8 [nei]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endonuclease VIII", "short" "Endonuclease-VIII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 900, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1238, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1238, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 933}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
