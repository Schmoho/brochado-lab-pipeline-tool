{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) sequentially phosphorylates four serine residues on glycogen synthase (GS), in the sequence SxxxSxxxSxxx-SxxxS(p), by recognising and phosphorylating the first serine in the sequence motif SxxxS(P) (where S(p) represents a phosphoserine). Interaction of GSK-3 with a peptide derived from GSK-3 binding protein prevents GSK-3 interaction with Axin. This interaction thereby inhibits the Axin-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK-3 [[cite:PUB00010493]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4afj", "name" "5-aryl-4-carboxamide-1,3-oxazoles: potent and selective GSK-3 inhibitors"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35154" "GBP PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF05350" "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 binding protein", "short" "GSK3-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 376, "taxa" 1838, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 806, "sets" 0, "proteins" 724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 441}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008014", :literature {"PUB00010493" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Bax B" "Carter PS" "Lewis C" "Guy AR" "Bridges A" "Tanner R" "Pettman G" "Mannix C" "Culbert AA" "Brown MJ" "Smith DG" "Reith AD."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00679-7", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The structure of phosphorylated GSK-3beta complexed with a peptide, FRATtide, that inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1143-52", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11738041}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008014", "name" "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 606}}}
