{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of helicases, including DNA2 and Nam7. Proteins in this family contain a conserved domain with is a P-loop motif that is characteristic of the AAA superfamily. They are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)1, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF2 helicases, SF1 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA [[cite:PUB00005492], [cite:PUB00003826], [cite:PUB00094062]].</p>\n\n<p>DNA2 is a DNA replication factor with single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, ATP-dependent nuclease, (5'-flap endonuclease) and helicase activities [[cite:PUB00035381], [cite:PUB00062306]]. Nam7 (also known as Upf1) is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway [[cite:PUB00091668]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5mzn", "name" "Helicase Sen1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10887" "DNA2/NAM7 HELICASE FAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA2/NAM7-like helicase", "short" "DNA2/NAM7-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 53, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4568, "taxa" 18814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42658, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15201}, "pathways" 70}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
