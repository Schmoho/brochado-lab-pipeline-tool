{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase (S-Adenosyl-L-methionine:uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase, SUMT), an enzyme of the sirohaem and cobalamin biosynthetic pathway, catalyses C methylation of uroporphyrinogen III ([ec:2.1.1.107]) [[cite:PUB00002147], [cite:PUB00002148]]. It transfers two methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the C-2 and C-7 atoms of uroporphyrinogen III to yield precorrin-2 via the intermediate formation of precorrin-1. SUMT is the first enzyme committed to the biosynthesis of either sirohaem or cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) rather than haem, and precorrin-2 is a common intermediate in the biosynthesis of corrinoids such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, sirohaem and coenzyme F<sub>430</sub>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this family represent a separate, plant-specific group of SUMT (also called UPM). They are characterised by an additional unique N-terminal domain of unknown function, and therefore greater length than the canonical SUMTs. Part of this N-terminal domain resembles a transit peptide for localisation to mitochondria or plastids [[cite:PUB00006363]]. The protein produced by in vitro expression is able to enter isolated intact chloroplasts but not mitochondria [[cite:PUB00006363]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035996", "name" "Tetrapyrrole methylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036478" "Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase, plant", "short" "Uropor_MeTrfase_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 35, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
