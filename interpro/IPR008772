{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PhnH is an essential component of the C-P lyase core complex formed through the interaction with other Phn proteins (G, I and J). This core complex is involved in the C-P lyase pathway that converts phosphonate into 5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-diphosphate (PRPP) and is activated upon phosphate starvation in many bacterial species including Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the 14-cistron phn operon is required for phosphonate uptake and utilisation and encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter (PhnC, PhnD, and PhnE), a regulatory protein (PhnF) and components required for enzymatic conversion of phosphonate into PRPP (PhnGHIJKLMNOP) [[cite:PUB00079189], [cite:PUB00047471]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xb6", "name" "Structure of the E. coli C-P lyase core complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038058", "name" "PhnH-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF020680" "Protein Phnh"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03292" "phosphonate C-P lyase system protein PhnH"}, "pfam" {"PF05845" "Bacterial phosphonate metabolism protein (PhnH)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterial phosphonate metabolism, PhnH", "short" "Phosphonate_metab_PhnH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 1218, "taxa" 5555, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4972, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4967, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3897}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1381", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1381"} {"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"} {"accession" "GenProp1630", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1630"} {"accession" "GenProp1165", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1165"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
