{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methanogenic archaea produce methane via the anaerobic reduction of acetate or single carbon compounds [[cite:PUB00010729]]. Coenzyme M (CoM; 2-mercaptoethanesulphonic acid) serves as the terminal methyl carrier for this process. Previously thought to be unique to methanogenic archaea, CoM has also been found in methylotrophic bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biosynthesis of CoM begins with the Michael addition of sulphite to phosphoenolpyruvate, forming 2-phospho-3-sulpholactate (PSL). This reaction is catalyzed by members of this family, PSL synthase (ComA) [[cite:PUB00010730]]. Subsequently, PSL is dephosphorylated by phosphosulpholactate phosphatase (ComB) to form 3-sulpholactate [[cite:PUB00010731]], which is then converted to \r\n3-sulphopyruvate by L-sulpholactate dehydrogenase (ComC; [ec:1.1.1.272]) [[cite:PUB00010732]]. Sulphopyruvate decarboxylase (ComDE; [ec:4.1.1.79]) converts 3-sulphopyruvate to sulphoacetaldehyde [[cite:PUB00010733]]. Reductive thiolation of sulphoacetaldehyde is the final step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes some proteins from plants and fungi, such as HEAT-STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00077547]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qwg", "name" "Crystal structure of Methanococcus jannaschii phosphosulfolactate synthase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036112", "name" "(2R)-phospho-3-sulpholactate synthase, ComA superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02679" "(2R)-phospho-3-sulfolactate synthase (ComA)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "(2R)-phospho-3-sulpholactate synthase, ComA", "short" "ComA_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 36, "proteomes" 1511, "taxa" 5560, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4824, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4793, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3597}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
