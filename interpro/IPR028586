{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenylate kinases (AKs) are nucleoside monophosphate kinases, which catalyse the phosphorylation of AMP by using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In humans, nine different AK isoenzymes have been identified (AK1-9). This entry represents AK3/4. Both AK3 and AK4 are localised in the mitochondrial matrix. AK3 is expressed in liver, heart and skeletal muscle, while AK4 is expressed predominantly in kidney [[cite:PUB00068795]]. Despite its homology with AK3, AK4 shows no enzymatic activity in vitro [[cite:PUB00068795]]. AK4 contains an unusual feature of an N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence that remains uncleaved after import into the mitochondria [[cite:PUB00068797]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes yeast mitochondrial adenylate kinase, Adk2.
