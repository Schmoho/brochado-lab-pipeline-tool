{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha-Ketoglutaric Semialdehyde (KGSA) Dehydrogenase (KGSADH, [ec:1.2.1.26]) catalyses the NAD(P)-dependent conversion of KGSA to alpha-ketoglutarate. This entry includes KGSADH-II (D-glucarate/D-galactarate-inducible) and KGSADH-III (hydroxy-L-proline-inducible) from Azospirillum brasilense. Both show similar high substrate specificity for KGSA and different coenzyme specificity; KGSADH-II is NAD-dependent and KGSADH-III is NADP-dependent [[cite:PUB00095200]]. This entry also includes the NADP(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase from Vibrio harveyi which catalyses the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to acids [[cite:PUB00024708], [cite:PUB00095201]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3v4c", "name" "Crystal structure of a semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07129" "Alpha-Ketoglutaric Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase", "short" "ALDH_KGSADH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2464, "taxa" 9008, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11584, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9011}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
