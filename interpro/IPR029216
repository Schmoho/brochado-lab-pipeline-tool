{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the antigenic membrane protein (also known as Phyto-Amp) from Candidatus Phytoplasma [[cite:PUB00069898]]. The bacteria are limited to the phloem and pose a major threat to agriculture worldwide. They are transmitted in a persistent, propagative manner by phloem-sucking Hemipteran insects. Phytoplasma membrane proteins are in direct contact with hosts and are assumed to be involved in determining vector specificity. Phyto-Amp is thought to be one family of proteins that mediates such specificity. The proteins appear to be encoded by circular extrachromosomal elements, at least one of which is a plasmid [[cite:PUB00069899]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15438" "Antigenic membrane protein of phytoplasma"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phytoplasma antigenic membrane protein", "short" "Phyto-Amp"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 47, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 61, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 58}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029216", :literature {"PUB00069898" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["Barbara DJ" "Morton A" "Clark MF" "Davies DL."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Immunodominant membrane proteins from two phytoplasmas in the aster yellows clade (chlorante aster yellows and clover phyllody) are highly divergent in the major hydrophilic region.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "157-67", "volume" "148", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11782508}, "PUB00069899" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Galetto L" "Bosco D" "Balestrini R" "Genre A" "Fletcher J" "Marzachi C."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022571", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The major antigenic membrane protein of \"Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris\" selectively interacts with ATP synthase and actin of leafhopper vectors.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e22571", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21799902}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029216", "name" "Phytoplasma antigenic membrane protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 2}}}
