{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of short eukaryotic sequences, including the mouse micropeptide known as the Plasticity-Associated Neural Transcript Short (Pants, also known as UPF0545 protein C22orf39 homolog), which plays a role in synaptic plasticity [[cite:PUB00152996]]. The absence of Pants in humans is associated with high risk for schizophrenia [[cite:PUB00152995]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Early meiotic induction protein 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Emi1), which is required for transcriptional induction of the early meiotic-specific transcription factor Ime1 [[cite:PUB00075393]], and other plant, fungal and animal uncharacterised proteins. Deletion of Emi1 affects mitochondrial morphology [[cite:PUB00075394]].</p>\n\n<p>This family was previously known as DUF3128.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11326" "Synaptic plasticity regulator PANTS-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR28052" "UPF0545 PROTEIN C22ORF39"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasticity-Associated Neural Transcript Short/Early meiotic induction protein 1-like", "short" "Pants/Emi1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 40, "proteomes" 1987, "taxa" 6985, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3183, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3180, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2015}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021475", :literature {"PUB00075393" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Enyenihi AH" "Saunders WS."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Large-scale functional genomic analysis of sporulation and meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "47-54", "volume" "163", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12586695}, "PUB00075394" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Longen S" "Bien M" "Bihlmaier K" "Kloeppel C" "Kauff F" "Hammermeister M" "Westermann B" "Herrmann JM" "Riemer J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
