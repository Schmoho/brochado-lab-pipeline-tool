{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Poxin (poxvirus immune nucleases) from Baculovirus and Vaccinia virus. Poxin is a nuclease that cleaves host 2',3'-cGAMP [[cite:PUB00092858]]. In human hosts, enzyme cGAS recognizes cytosolic DNA and synthesizes 2'3' cGAMP to activate STING-dependent interferon and NF-kappaB immune responses. Poxin is the viral factor responsible for 2'3' cGAMP degradation [[cite:PUB00092858]]. Interestingly, in some poxviruses the poxin is expressed as a poxin-schlafen fusion protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8orv", "name" "Crystal structure of monkeypox virus poxin in complex with the STING agonist MD1203"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04143" "Poxin-Schlafen"}, "pfam" {"PF04766" "Nucleopolyhedrovirus p26 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxin, virus", "short" "Poxin_vir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 78, "taxa" 349, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 345, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006853", :literature {"PUB00092858" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7743", "authors" ["Eaglesham JB" "Pan Y" "Kupper TS" "Kranzusch PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Viral and metazoan poxins are cGAMP-specific nucleases that restrict cGAS-STING signalling.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "259-263", "volume" "566", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30728498}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0004518", "name" "nuclease activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006853", "name" "Poxin, virus", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 25, "alignment:full" 54}}}
