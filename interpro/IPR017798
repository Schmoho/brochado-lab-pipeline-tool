E. coli K-12 family strains have two D-xylonic acid dehydratases, YjhG and YagF. They can convert D-xylonate into 2-keto-3-deoxy- D-xylonate (KDX) [[cite:PUB00086863]].They are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of 1,2,4-butanetriol and other chemicals [[cite:PUB00076909]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037237", "name" "IlvD/EDD, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03432" "YjhG/YagF family D-xylonate dehydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-xylonate dehydratase YjhG/YagF", "short" "Dehydratase_YjhG/YagF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 241, "taxa" 1162, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1200, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1200, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 841}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
