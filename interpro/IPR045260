{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors, including Sec12 and its paralogue, Sed4, from budding yeasts. Sec12 is an ER type II membrane protein and a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for Sar1 (a small GTPase). It is required for the initiation of COPII vesicle formation in ER to Golgi transport [[cite:PUB00098400]]. Sed4 has been shown to bind to cargo-free Sar1, stimulates Sar1 GTP hydrolysis and promotes limited coat disassembly [[cite:PUB00098401]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4h5i", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Sec12 (P1 form)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23284" "PROLACTIN REGULATORY ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Sec12-like", "short" "Sec12-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2439, "taxa" 8460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5072, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3264}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045260", :literature {"PUB00098400" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Schlacht A" "Dacks JB."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol Evol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genome Biol Evol", "title" "Unexpected ancient paralogs and an evolutionary model for the COPII coat complex.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1098-109", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25747251}, "PUB00098401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kodera C" "Yorimitsu T" "Nakano A" "Sato K."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Sed4p stimulates Sar1p GTP hydrolysis and promotes limited coat disassembly.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "591-9", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21291503}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005085", "name" "guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045260", "name" "Guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Sec12-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
