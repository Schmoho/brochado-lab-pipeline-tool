{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes proliferation-associated protein 2G4 (PA2G4, also known as ErbB3-binding protein 1) and its homologues such as ARX1 from yeast [[cite:PUB00101963], [cite:PUB00102294]]. PA2G4 is a RNA-binding protein involved in growth regulation. This protein is present in pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes and may be involved in ribosome assembly and the regulation of intermediate and late steps of rRNA processing [[cite:PUB00101967], [cite:PUB00101968]]. This protein can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the ErbB3 receptor and may contribute to transducing growth regulatory signals [[cite:PUB00101966]]. This protein is also a transcriptional co-repressor of androgen receptor-regulated genes and other cell cycle regulatory genes through its interactions with histone deacetylases [[cite:PUB00101965], [cite:PUB00101964]]. ARX1 from yeast is involved in proper assembly of pre-ribosomal particles during the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00101963]]. Although these proteins belong to the peptidase M24 family, they do not contain metal cofactors and lack aminopeptidase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q8k", "name" "The crystal structure of Ebp1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036005", "name" "Creatinase/aminopeptidase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10804" "PROTEASE FAMILY M24 METHIONYL AMINOPEPTIDASE, AMINOPEPTIDASE P"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proliferation-associated protein 2G4/ARX1", "short" "PA2G4/ARX1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2554, "taxa" 8832, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3728}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047113", :literature {"PUB00101967" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Squatrito M" "Mancino M" "Donzelli M" "Areces LB" "Draetta GF."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "EBP1 is a nucleolar growth-regulating protein that is part of pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "4454-65", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15064750}, "PUB00101966" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Liu Z" "Ahn JY" "Liu X" "Ye K."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Ebp1 isoforms distinctively regulate cell survival and differentiation.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "10917-22", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16832058}, "PUB00101964" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Woodford N" "Xia X" "Hamburger AW."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Repression of E2F1-mediated transcription by the ErbB3 binding protein Ebp1 involves histone deacetylases.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "2168-77", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12682367}, "PUB00101965" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Hamburger AW."], "ISO_journal" "Br J Cancer", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Br J Cancer", "title" "Specificity and heregulin regulation of Ebp1 (ErbB3 binding protein 1) mediated repression of androgen receptor signalling.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "140-6", "volume" "92", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15583694}, "PUB00101963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Hung NJ" "Johnson AW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "title" "Nuclear recycling of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit-associated factor Arx1 depends on Rei1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "3718-27", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16648468}, "PUB00101968" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Horvath BM" "Magyar Z" "Zhang Y" "Hamburger AW" "Bako L" "Visser RG" "Bachem CW" "Bogre L."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "EBP1 regulates organ size through cell growth and proliferation in plants.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "4909-20", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17024182}, "PUB00102294" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Hwang I" "Ko HR" "Ahn JY."], "ISO_journal" "Exp Mol Med", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Exp Mol Med", "title" "The roles of multifunctional protein ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1) isoforms from development to disease.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1039-1047", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32719408}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047113", "name" "Proliferation-associated protein 2G4/ARX1", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004545", "name" "PA2G4 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
