{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic Aph-1 proteins. Aph-1 is an essential subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyses the intramembrane proteolysis of Notch, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and other substrates as part of a new signalling paradigm and as a key step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [[cite:PUB00059246]]. It is thought that the presenilin heterodimer comprises the catalytic site and that a highly glycosylated form of nicastrin associates with it. Aph-1 and Pen-2, two membrane proteins genetically linked to gamma-secretase, associate directly with presenilin and nicastrin in the active protease complex. Co-expression of all four proteins leads to marked increases in presenilin heterodimers, full glycosylation of nicastrin, and enhanced gamma-secretase activity [[cite:PUB00012265]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06105" "Aph-1 protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR12889" "GAMMA-SECRETASE SUBUNIT APH-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gamma-secretase subunit Aph-1", "short" "Aph-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 52, "proteomes" 1408, "taxa" 5642, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3632, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3401, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2301}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2017", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2017"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009294", :literature {"PUB00059246" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Francis R" "McGrath G" "Zhang J" "Ruddy DA" "Sym M" "Apfeld J" "Nicoll M" "Maxwell M" "Hai B" "Ellis MC" "Parks AL" "Xu W" "Li J" "Gurney M" "Myers RL" "Himes CS" "Hiebsch R" "Ruble C" "Nye JS" "Curtis D."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
