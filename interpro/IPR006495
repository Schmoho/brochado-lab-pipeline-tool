{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of sequences represent the acyl carrier protein (gamma subunit) of the holoenzyme citrate lyase ([ec:4.1.3.6]) composed of alpha ([ec:2.8.3.10]), beta ([ec:4.1.3.34]), and acyl carrier protein subunits in a stoichiometric relationship of 6:6:6. Citrate lyase is an enzyme which converts citrate to oxaloacetate. In bacteria, this reaction is involved in citrate fermentation. The acyl carrier protein covalently binds the coenzyme of citrate lyase. The set contains an experimentally characterised member from Leuconostoc mesenteroides [[cite:PUB00005807]]. The sequences come from a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria. For Gram-negative bacteria, it appears that only sequences from the gamma proteobacteria are included.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01608" "citrate lyase acyl carrier protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_00805" "Citrate lyase acyl carrier protein [citD]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002736" "Citrate lyase, gamma subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate lyase acyl carrier protein CitD", "short" "CitD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 512, "taxa" 3124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3179, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2521}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0672"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006495", :literature {"PUB00005807" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bekal S" "Van Beeumen J" "Samyn B" "Garmyn D" "Henini S" "Divies C" "Prevost H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
