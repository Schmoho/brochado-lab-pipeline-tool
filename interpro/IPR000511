{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Holocytochrome c-type synthase (HCCS, also known as cytochrome c-type heme lyase) ([ec:4.4.1.17]) and holocytochrome-c1 synthase (CC1HL, also known as cytochrome c1 heme lyase) [[cite:PUB00001421]] are mitochondrial enzymes that catalyse the covalent attachment of a haem group on two cysteine residues of cytochrome c and c1. These two enzymes are functionally and evolutionary related. There are two conserved regions, the first is located in the central section and the second in the C-terminal section. These enzymes contain a conserved histidine, which is key to interact with the heme iron and to form the HCCS:heme complex, the platform for interaction with apocytochrome c [[cite:PUB00096610]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00822" "Cytochrome c and c1 heme lyases signature 2", "PS00821" "Cytochrome c and c1 heme lyases signature 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR12743" "CYTOCHROME C1 HEME LYASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01265" "Cytochrome c/c1 heme lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holocytochrome c/c1 synthase", "short" "Holocyt_c/c1_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 92, "proteomes" 2354, "taxa" 9695, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6538, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3816}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00647", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00647"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
