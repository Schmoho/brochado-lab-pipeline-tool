Both the F1 and F0 complexes are rotary motors that are coupled back-to-back. In the F1 complex, the central gamma subunit forms the rotor inside the cylinder made of the α(3)β(3) subunits, while in the F0 complex, the ring-shaped C subunits forms the rotor. The two rotors rotate in opposite directions, but the F0 rotor is usually stronger, using the force from the proton gradient to push the F1 rotor in reverse in order to drive ATP synthesis  [[cite:PUB00009752]]. These ATPases can also work in reverse in bacteria, hydrolysing ATP to create a proton gradient.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The G subunit is a subunit of the F0 complex in mitochondria; its function is not established yet.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04718" "Mitochondrial ATP synthase g subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR12386" "ATP SYNTHASE SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP synthase, F0 complex, subunit G, mitochondrial", "short" "ATP_synth_F0_gsu_mt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 77, "proteomes" 2353, "taxa" 9394, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5358, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5334, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3037}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006808", :literature {"PUB00068789" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Radax C" "Sigurdsson O" "Hreggvidsson GO" "Aichinger N" "Gruber C" "Kristjansson JK" "Stan-Lotter H."], "ISO_journal" "Syst.
