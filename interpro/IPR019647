{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins that are activated by the protein PhoP. PhoP controls the expression of a large number of genes that mediate adaptation to low Mg2+ environments and/or virulence in several bacterial species. YbrL is proposed to be acting in a loop activity with PhoP and PrmA analogous to the multi-component loop in Salmonella sp., where the PhoP-dependent PmrD protein activates the regulatory protein PmrA, and the activated PmrA then represses transcription from the PmrD promoter which harbours binding sites for both the PhoP and PmrA proteins. Expression of YrbL is induced in low Mg2+ in a PhoP-dependent fashion and repressed by Fe3+ in a PmrA-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00044556]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10707" "PhoP regulatory network protein YrbL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PhoP regulatory network protein YrbL", "short" "PhoP_reg_network_YrbL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 273, "taxa" 1795, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1831, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1831, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1520}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019647", :literature {"PUB00044556" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Zwir I" "Shin D" "Kato A" "Nishino K" "Latifi T" "Solomon F" "Hare JM" "Huang H" "Groisman EA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
