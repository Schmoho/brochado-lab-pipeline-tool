{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human YVH1, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 12 (DUSP12), is a cell survival phosphatase that prevents both thermal and oxidative stress-induced cell death.

The enzyme is known as dual specificity protein phosphatase MPK-4 in<i>Drosophila</i> [[cite:PUB00085099]].
