{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of viral fusion proteins from the Chordopoxvirinae. A 14kDa Vaccinia virus protein has been demonstrated to function as a viral fusion protein mediating cell fusion at endosmomal (low) pH [[cite:PUB00009492]]. The protein, found in the envelope fraction of the virions, is required for fusing the outermost of the two golgi-derived membranes enveloping the virus with the plasma membrane, and its subsequent release extracellularly. The N-terminal proximal region is essential for its fusion ability.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02346" "Chordopoxvirus multifunctional envelope protein A27"}, "prints" {"PR01847" "VIRALFUSION"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chordopoxvirus fusion protein/multifunctional envelope protein A27", "short" "Chordopox_Fusion/A27"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 34, "taxa" 177, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 554, "sets" 0, "proteins" 554, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003436", :literature {"PUB00009492" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gong SC" "Lai CF" "Esteban M."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(90)90381-Z", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Vaccinia virus induces cell fusion at acid pH and this activity is mediated by the N-terminus of the 14-kDa virus envelope protein.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "81-91", "volume" "178", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2389560}, "PUB00075694" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Chang TH" "Chang SJ" "Hsieh FL" "Ko TP" "Lin CT" "Ho MR" "Wang I" "Hsu ST" "Guo RT" "Chang W" "Wang AH."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003563", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Crystal structure of vaccinia viral A27 protein reveals a novel structure critical for its function and complex formation with A26 protein.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e1003563", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23990784}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019064", "name" "fusion of virus membrane with host plasma membrane", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019031", "name" "viral envelope", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003436", "name" "Chordopoxvirus fusion protein/multifunctional envelope protein A27", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 51}}}
