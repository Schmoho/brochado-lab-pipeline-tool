{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tail of bacteriophage T7, a member of the Podoviridae family, is composed of at least four proteins; one of them is gene product 8 (gp8), known as the connector [[cite:PUB00081256]]. DNA enters the viral head during DNA packaging through a channel formed by the connector. The connector sits at a unique 5-fold vertex of the icosahedral capsid [[cite:PUB00082265]], which is also involved in the delivery of the genome during DNA ejection. Purified gp8 protein has been shown to assemble as a dodecamer [[cite:PUB00082266]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family includes connector proteins from Podoviridae and bacterial proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12236" "Bacteriophage head to tail connecting protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Head-to-tail connector protein, podovirus-type", "short" "Connector_podovirus"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 767, "taxa" 4592, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4036, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4020, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1767}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020991", :literature {"PUB00082266" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Agirrezabala X" "Martin-Benito J" "Valle M" "Gonzalez JM" "Valencia A" "Valpuesta JM" "Carrascosa JL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
