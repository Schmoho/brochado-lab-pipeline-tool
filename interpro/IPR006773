{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Rpn13 from budding yeasts and its homologue, ADRM1 from animals.</p>\n\n<p>Rpn13 is a subunit and an ubiquitin receptor of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome lid. The 26S proteasome is a huge macromolecular protein-degradation machine consisting of a proteolytically active 20S core, in the form of four disc-like proteins, and one or two 19S regulatory particles. The regulatory particle(s) sit on the top and or bottom of the core, de-ubiquitinate the substrate peptides, unfold them and guide them into the narrow channel through the centre of the core. Rpn13 and its homologues dock onto the regulatory particle through the N-terminal region which binds Rpn2. The C-terminal part of the domain binds de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 and enhances its isopeptidase activity. Rpn13 binds ubiquitin via a conserved amino-terminal region called the pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin, termed Pru, domain [[cite:PUB00053442]]. The domain forms two contiguous anti-parallel Î²-sheets with a configuration similar to the pleckstrin-homology domain (PHD) fold [[cite:PUB00049233], [cite:PUB00054318]]. Rpn13's ability to bind ubiquitin and the proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously supports evidence of its role as a ubiquitin receptor. Finally, when complexed to di-ubiquitin, via the Pru, and Uch37 via the C-terminal part, it frees up the distal ubiquitin for de-ubiquitination by the Uch37 [[cite:PUB00049233]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6oi4", "name" "RPN13 (19-132)-RPN2 (940-952) pY950-Ub complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038633", "name" "Proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn13/ADRM1, Pru domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12225" "ADHESION REGULATING MOLECULE 1 110 KDA CELL MEMBRANE GLYCOPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn13/ADRM1", "short" "Rpn13/ADRM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2512, "taxa" 10578, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3411}, "pathways" 381}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2012", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2012"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006773", :literature {"PUB00054318" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chen X" "Lee BH" "Finley D" "Walters KJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
