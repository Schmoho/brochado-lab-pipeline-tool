{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Riboflavin is converted into catalytically active cofactors (FAD and FMN) by the actions of riboflavin kinase ([ec:2.7.1.26]), which converts it into FMN, and FAD synthetase ([ec:2.7.7.2]), which adenylates FMN to FAD. Eukaryotes usually have two separate enzymes, while most prokaryotes have a single bifunctional protein that can carry out both catalyses, although exceptions occur in both cases. While eukaryotic monofunctional riboflavin kinase is orthologous to the bifunctional prokaryotic enzyme [[cite:PUB00030175]], the monofunctional FAD synthetase differs from its prokaryotic counterpart, and is instead related to the PAPS-reductase family [[cite:PUB00035657]]. The bacterial FAD synthetase that is part of the bifunctional enzyme has remote similarity to nucleotidyl transferases and, hence, it may be involved in the adenylylation reaction of FAD synthetases [[cite:PUB00010127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents riboflavin kinase, which occurs as part of a bifunctional enzyme or a stand-alone enzyme.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1nb9", "name" "Crystal Structure of Riboflavin Kinase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023465", "name" "Riboflavin kinase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22749" "RIBOFLAVIN KINASE/FMN ADENYLYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Riboflavin kinase", "short" "Riboflavin_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11485, "taxa" 42838, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 47383, "sets" 0, "proteins" 47383, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35427}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
