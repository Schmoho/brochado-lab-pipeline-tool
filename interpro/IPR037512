{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) and is limited to prokaryotes. PGP is an essential enzyme in the glycolate salvage pathway in higher organisms (photorespiration in plants). Phosphoglycolate results from the oxidase activity of RubisCO in the Calvin cycle when concentrations of carbon dioxide are low relative to oxygen. In Ralstonia eutropha and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the PGP gene (CbbZ) is located on an operon along with other Calvin cycle enzymes including RubisCO [[cite:PUB00009585], [cite:PUB00009586]]. In E. coli, however, there does not appear to be a functional Calvin cycle (RubisCO is absent), although the E. coli PGP gene (gph) is on the same operon (dam) with ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase (rpe), a gene in the pentose-phosphate pathway (along with other, unrelated genes) [[cite:PUB00077032]]. The E. coli enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 2-phosphoglycolate and it is involved in salvage in the metabolism of a two-carbon compound generated by the cellular DNA repair machinery [[cite:PUB00087084]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This enzyme is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolase enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hsz", "name" "Crystal structure of a predicted phosphoglycolate phosphatase (hs_0176) from haemophilus somnus 129pt at 1.90 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00495" "Phosphoglycolate phosphatase [gph]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01449" "phosphoglycolate phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoglycolate phosphatase, prokaryotic", "short" "PGPase_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2425, "taxa" 10186, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12383, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12383, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9670}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
