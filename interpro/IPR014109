{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein is part of a large group of proteins involved in conjugative transfer of plasmid DNA, specifically the F-type system.  This protein has been predicted to contain a thioredoxin fold, contains a conserved pair of cysteines and has been shown to function as a thiol disulfide isomerase by complementation of an Ecoli DsbA defect [[cite:PUB00034395]].  The protein is believed to be involved in pilin assembly [[cite:PUB00034396]].  The protein is closely related to TraF ([interpro:IPR014110]) which is somewhat longer, lacks the cysteine motif and is apparently not functional as a disulfide bond isomerase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02738" "type-F conjugative transfer system pilin assembly thiol-disulfide isomerase TrbB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type-F conjugative transfer system pilin assembly thiol-disulphide isomerase TrbB", "short" "Thiol-disulphide_isomerase_rbB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 508, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 856, "sets" 0, "proteins" 856, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 672}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0484", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0484"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014109", :literature {"PUB00034395" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Elton TC" "Holland SJ" "Frost LS" "Hazes B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
