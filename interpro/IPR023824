{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are found in beta, gamma, and delta proteobacteria, and in the verrucomicrobia. Twenty-two of twenty-four species encountered contain the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system for modulating extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis production, suggesting a role in protein sorting. There is a distant sequence relationship between a region of this protein of about 100 amino acids and a corresponding region of the very large eukaryotic protein  Vps13, associated with vacuolar protein sorting in yeast.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04073" "exosortase system-associated protein, TIGR04073 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP04073, exosortase-affiliated", "short" "CHP04073_exosortase-affil"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 107, "taxa" 612, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1155, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 836}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023824", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023824", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP04073, exosortase-affiliated", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
