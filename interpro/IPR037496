{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Notch signaling pathway regulates genes involved in cell fate decision throughout development. Its activity relies notably on the CSL transcription factors. BEND6 is a BEN-solo (bears a single BEN domain) factor that binds CSL via its BEN domain and acts as a CSL co-repressor. BEND6 associates with and represses Notch target genes, antagonizing Notch signaling in neural stem cells, thereby opposing their self-renewal and promoting neurogenesis [[cite:PUB00087062]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes BEN-solo factors from Drosophila, namely protein insensitive, Elba 1 and Elba2, which share functional attributes with BEND6. They recognise CCAATTGG palindromes to mediate transcriptional repression [[cite:PUB00097582]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7yul", "name" "Crystal structure of human BEND6 BEN domain in complex with DNA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35346" "BEN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BEN domain-containing protein 6-like", "short" "BEND6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 632, "taxa" 2370, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1374, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 896}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037496", :literature {"PUB00097582" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Dai Q" "Ren A" "Westholm JO" "Duan H" "Patel DJ" "Lai EC."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Common and distinct DNA-binding and regulatory activities of the BEN-solo transcription factor family.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "48-62", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25561495}, "PUB00087062" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Dai Q" "Andreu-Agullo C" "Insolera R" "Wong LC" "Shi SH" "Lai EC."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.087502", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "BEND6 is a nuclear antagonist of Notch signaling during self-renewal of neural stem cells.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1892-902", "volume" "140", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23571214}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003714", "name" "transcription corepressor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045666", "name" "positive regulation of neuron differentiation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045746", "name" "negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR037496", "name" "BEN domain-containing protein 6-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
