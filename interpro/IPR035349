{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rec104 is one of several meiosis specific genes required for generating meiotic DSBs (double strand breaks) [[cite:PUB00085334]]. It is suggested that Rec102 and Rec104 directly promote DSB formation as part of a multiprotein complex with Spo11. Rec102 and Rec104 are mutually dependent for proper sub-cellular localization, and share a requirement for Spo11 and Ski8 for their recruitment to meiotic chromosomes. Moreover, Rec102 is required for Rec104 to accumulate to normal steady-state levels and to be properly phosphorylated. It is likely that Rec102 and Rec104 move freely in and out of the nucleus but are most stably sequestered there only when they can form a complex on chromosomes [[cite:PUB00085335]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17378" "Meiotic recombination protein REC104"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Meiotic recombination protein Rec104", "short" "Rec104"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 35, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035349", :literature {"PUB00085334" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pecina A" "Smith KN" "Mezard C" "Murakami H" "Ohta K" "Nicolas A."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01002-4", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Targeted stimulation of meiotic recombination.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "173-84", "volume" "111", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12408862}, "PUB00085335" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Kee K" "Protacio RU" "Arora C" "Keeney S."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600184", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Spatial organization and dynamics of the association of Rec102 and Rec104 with meiotic chromosomes.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1815-24", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15044957}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042138", "name" "meiotic DNA double-strand break formation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035349", "name" "Meiotic recombination protein Rec104", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 3}}}
