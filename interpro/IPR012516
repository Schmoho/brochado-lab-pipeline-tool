{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the halocidin family of antimicrobial peptides. Halocidins are isolated from the haemocytes of the tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium (Sea peach). They are dimeric in structures, which are found via a disulphide linkage between cysteines of two different- sized monomers. Halocidins have been shown to have strong antimicrobial activities against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria and could be ideal candidates as peptide antibiotics against multidrug-resistant bacteria [[cite:PUB00016429]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08108" "Halocidin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Halocidin", "short" "Antimicrobial13"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 15, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012516", :literature {"PUB00016429" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Jang WS" "Kim KN" "Lee YS" "Nam MH" "Lee IH."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(02)02827-2", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Halocidin: a new antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of the solitary tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "81-6", "volume" "521", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12067731}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042742", "name" "defense response to bacterium", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012516", "name" "Halocidin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
