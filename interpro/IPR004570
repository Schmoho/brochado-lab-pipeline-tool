{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CDP-diacylglycerol--glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase ([ec:2.7.8.5]), also known as phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, glycerophosphate phosphatidyltransferase and PGP synthase, catalyses the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate to CMP and 3-(3-phosphatidyl)-glycerol 1-phosphate in the committed step to the synthesis of acidic phospholipids. It is an integral membrane protein. A number of related enzymes are quite similar in both sequence and catalytic activity, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) YDL142c, now known to be a cardiolipin synthase.
