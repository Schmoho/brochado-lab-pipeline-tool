{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the enzyme o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase (menC) and N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR, or the more general term, racemase/racemase family). MenC is involved in one of the steps of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway. It takes 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) and makes it into 2-succinylbenzoate.  Also included are enzymes with the common name of N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR, or the more general term, racemase/racemase family), which refers to the enzyme's industrial application as a racemase that catalyses the racemization of N-acylamino acids, and not to its biological function as o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase [[cite:PUB00013780]]. NAAARs act on a broad range of N-acylamino acids rather than amino acids. Enantiopure amino acids are of industrial interest as chiral building blocks for antibiotics, herbicides, and drugs. Most members of this group of o-succinylbenzoate synthases are proteins from low GC Gram-positive bacteria and archaea. menC/NAAAR is a member of the enolase superfamily, characterized by the presence of an enolate anion intermediate which is generated by abstraction of the alpha-proton of the carboxylate substrate by an active site residue and is stabilized by coordination to the essential Mg2+ ion [[cite:PUB00030467], [cite:PUB00031079]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sjd", "name" "x-ray structure of o-succinylbenzoate synthase complexed with n-succinyl phenylglycine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036849", "name" "Enolase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03317" "NAAAR"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01928" "o-succinylbenzoate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "o-Succinylbenzoate synthase/NAAAR", "short" "OSBS/NAAAR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1210, "taxa" 4881, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4505}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1560", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1560"} {"accession" "GenProp0058", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0058"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
