{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this entry contain the Arb2 domain that gets its name from S. pombe Argonaute-binding protein 2 (Arb2), which is the orthologue of the vertebrate cotranscriptional regulator ARB2A (also known as FAM172 family) [[cite:PUB00044153]]. Human FAM172A protein is associated with CHARGE syndrome, a severe multi-organ developmental disorder mainly affecting derivatives of cranial and cardiac neural crest cells (NCCs). CHARGE syndrome has been suggested to be a spliceosomopathy, due to perturbation of chromatin-mediated alternative splicing [[cite:PUB00151888], [cite:PUB00090322]]. FAM172A and its homologues contain a large Arb2 domain split into two halves by a classical bipartite NLS that helps to stabilise the chromatin-spliceosome interface as part of a complex that includes CHD7 and AGO2 [[cite:PUB00151888]]. It has been suggested that FAM172A can connect the alternative splicing machinery to specific transcribed  regions [[cite:PUB00151888], [cite:PUB00090322]]. S. pombe Arb2 is a member of the argonaute siRNA chaperone (ARC) complex which is required for histone H3K9 methylation, heterochromatin assembly and siRNA generation. The Arb2 domain has clear homology to α/β-hydrolases but it lacks the catalytic triad of these enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21357" "FAM172 FAMILY PROTEIN HOMOLOG CG10038"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arb2", "short" "Arb2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1528, "taxa" 5304, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3856, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3856, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2365}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048263", :literature {"PUB00044153" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Buker SM" "Iida T" "Buhler M" "Villen J" "Gygi SP" "Nakayama J" "Moazed D."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
