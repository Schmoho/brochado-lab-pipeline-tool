{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Striated fibre assemblin (SFA), an acidic 33kDa protein, is the major component of striated microtubule-associated fibres (SMAFs) in the flagellar basal apparatus of green flagellates. In Chlamydomonas, and other green flagellates, the SMAFs form a cross-like pattern and run alongside the proximal parts of four bundles of flagellar root microtubules.</p>\n\n<p>The sequence of SFA contains two structurally distinct domains [[cite:PUB00011691]]. The head domain, with ~30 residues, contains all the prolines (3-8 depending on species) and is rich in hydroxyamino acids. This non-helical domain is further characterised by the presence of repetitive SP-motifs, some of them in the context SP(M/T)R, which is a putative substrate for p34-CDC2 kinase. The rod domain, with ~250 residues, is predicted to be mostly α-helical (the α-helix content was estimated to be 76% for the entire molecule or 85% for the postulated rod domain). This domain shows a pronounced coiled-coil-forming ability and contains a 29-residue repeat pattern based on four heptads, followed by a skip residue. The rod domains of SF-assemblin and beta-giardin from protozoan Giardia have the same length and display 42% sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00011691], [cite:PUB00088847]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40412" "SF-ASSEMBLIN"}, "pfam" {"PF06705" "SF-assemblin/beta giardin"}, "prints" {"PR01799" "SFASSEMBLIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SF-assemblin/beta-giardin", "short" "SF_assemblin/giardin_b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 180, "taxa" 847, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2170, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1726}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008374", :literature {"PUB00011691" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Weber K" "Geisler N" "Plessmann U" "Bremerich A" "Lechtreck KF" "Melkonian M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
