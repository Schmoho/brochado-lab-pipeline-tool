{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nance-Horan syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterised by congenital cataracts, dental anomalies, dysmorphic features, and, in some cases, mental disabilities [[cite:PUB00056664]]. The syndrome is caused by defects in the NHS gene [[cite:PUB00056663]], which appears to play a key role in the regulation of eye, tooth, brain, and craniofacial development [[cite:PUB00056664]]. It may function in cell morphology by maintaining the integrity of the circumferential actin ring and controlling lamellipodia formation [[cite:PUB00101114]]. However, the protein's exact function is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the NHS protein family, which includes Actin remodeling regulator NHS, as well as NHS-like proteins 1, 2 and 3.
