{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant F-box/kelch-repeat proteins, including KMD1-4 from Arabidopsis. They belong to the kiss me deadly (KMD) family, whose members target type-B ARR proteins for degradation. They form an S-phase kinase-associated PROTEIN1 (SKP1)/Cullin/F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and directly interact with type-B ARR proteins, which then regulates the transcriptional response to cytokinin [[cite:PUB00096510]]. KMD1 (At1g80440, also known as KFB20), KMD2 (AT1G15670, also known KFB01) and KDM4 (also known as SKIP20) interact with four PAL isozymes and mediate their proteolytic turnover via the ubiquitination-26S proteasome pathway [[cite:PUB00096511]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015915", "name" "Kelch-type beta propeller", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46407" "OS02G0208700 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F-box/kelch-repeat protein KMD1-4", "short" "KMD1-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 301, "taxa" 1492, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2091, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2091, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1228}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044595", :literature {"PUB00096510" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Kim HJ" "Chiang YH" "Kieber JJ" "Schaller GE."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
