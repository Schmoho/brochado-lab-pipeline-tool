However, several lines of evidence suggest that they do not function as a conventional motility receptors for hyaluronan, leading to the suggestion they should be renamed intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein (IHABP) [[cite:PUB00060205], [cite:PUB00060207]].</p>\n\n<p>IHABP is overexpressed in many cancers and may be involved in cellular transformation and metastasis formation [[cite:PUB00060716]], and in regulating extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity [[cite:PUB00060717]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18956" "HYALURONAN MEDIATED MOTILITY RECEPTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein", "short" "IHABP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 758, "taxa" 3120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1445, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1445, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 878}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026203", :literature {"PUB00060205" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hofmann M" "Fieber C" "Assmann V" "Gottlicher M" "Sleeman J" "Plug R" "Howells N" "von Stein O" "Ponta H" "Herrlich P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
