{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA polymerase zeta (Pol zeta) belongs to the B-family of polymerases. It is a nonessential DNA polymerase responsible for the majority of damage-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00073192]]. It is involved in double-strand breaks DNA repair [[cite:PUB00073194]] and has a major role in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) , an alternative DNA damage tolerance mechanism that allows the DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions [[cite:PUB00073195], [cite:PUB00073197]]. Pol zeta lacks proofreading activity and its discrimination against insertion of incorrect bases is lower than that of other B-family polymerases [[cite:PUB00073196]]. Discrimination against ribonucleotide incorporation is only slightly lower than in the case of the replicative DNA polymerases [[cite:PUB00073193]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally discovered in budding yeast, genes encoding this enzyme have been found in all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes [[cite:PUB00073199]]. Its role in translesion replication is probably the most widespread [[cite:PUB00073200]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45812" "DNA POLYMERASE ZETA CATALYTIC SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase zeta catalytic subunit", "short" "PolZ_Rev3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2521, "taxa" 8608, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5847, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5847, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1200}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
