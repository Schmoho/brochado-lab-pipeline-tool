{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is the toxin of a type 1 toxin-antitoxin system which is found in a relatively widespread range of bacterial species. The species distribution suggests frequent horizontal gene transfer.  In a type 1 system, as characterised for the plasmid-encoded E coli hok/sok system, the toxin-encoding stable mRNA encodes a protein which rapidly leads to cell death unless the translation is suppressed by a short-lived small RNA. The plasmid-encoded module prevents the growth of plasmid-free offspring, thus ensuring the persistence of the plasmid in the population. Plasmid-free cells arising after cell-division will be killed because the stable mRNA toxin is present while the comparably unstable anti-toxin is rapidly degraded. Where the system is transcribed chromosomally, the mechanism is poorly understood [[cite:PUB00056084]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12703" "Toxin of toxin-antitoxin type 1 system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin-antitoxin type 1 system, toxin component", "short" "Toxin-antitoxin_type_1_toxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 356, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 157, "sets" 0, "proteins" 157, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 111}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024640", :literature {"PUB00056084" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Findeiss S" "Schmidtke C" "Stadler PF" "Bonas U."], "ISO_journal" "RNA Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "RNA Biol", "title" "A novel family of plasmid-transferred anti-sense ncRNAs.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "120-4", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20220307}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024640", "name" "Toxin-antitoxin type 1 system, toxin component", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 26}}}
