{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family average over 900 residues in length and appear to have multiple membrane-spanning helices in the N-terminal half. The extreme C-terminal region consists of a motif with consensus sequence MSEP, then a transmembrane Î± helix, then a short region with several basic residues. This region, hereby dubbed MSEP-CTERM, resembles other putative sorting signals associated with the archaeosortase/exosortase protein family (see [ncbifam:TIGR04178]).
