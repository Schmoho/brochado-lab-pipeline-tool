{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of bacterial haemolysin E (HlyE) proteins. HlyE is a toxin, which has some hemolytic activity towards mammalian cells. It acts by forming a pore-like structure upon contact with mammalian cells [[cite:PUB00062402]].\r\nHlyE is unrelated to the well characterised pore-forming E. coli haemolysins of the RTX family, haemolysin A (HlyA), and the enterohaemolysin encoded by the plasmid borne ehxA gene of E. coli 0157. However, it is evident that expression of HlyE in the absence of the RTX toxins is sufficient to give a haemolytic phenotype in E. coli. HlyE is a protein of 34kDa that is expressed during anaerobic growth of E. coli. Anaerobic expression is controlled by the transcription factor, FNR, such that, upon ingestion and entry into the anaerobic mammalian intestine, HlyE is produced and may then contribute to the colonisation of the host [[cite:PUB00012266]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4phq", "name" "ClyA CC6/264 ox (6-303)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06109" "Haemolysin E (HlyE)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hemolysin E", "short" "Hemolysin_E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 293, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 482, "sets" 0, "proteins" 476, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 364}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027018", :literature {"PUB00062402" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wai SN" "Lindmark B" "Soderblom T" "Takade A" "Westermark M" "Oscarsson J" "Jass J" "Richter-Dahlfors A" "Mizunoe Y" "Uhlin BE."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00754-2", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Vesicle-mediated export and assembly of pore-forming oligomers of the enterobacterial ClyA cytotoxin.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "25-35", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14532000}, "PUB00012266" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wallace AJ" "Stillman TJ" "Atkins A" "Jamieson SJ" "Bullough PA" "Green J" "Artymiuk PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81564-0", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "E. coli hemolysin E (HlyE, ClyA, SheA): X-ray crystal structure of the toxin and observation of membrane pores by electron microscopy.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "265-76", "volume" "100", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10660049}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0044179", "name" "hemolysis in another organism", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027018", "name" "Hemolysin E", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 69}}}
