{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents enzymes that perform ADP-ribosylations, including ADP-ribosylhydrolase ARH1/3 from animals, which preferentially hydrolyses the scissile alpha-O-linkage attached to the anomeric C1'' position of ADP-ribose and acts on different substrates, such as proteins ADP-ribosylated on serine and threonine, free poly(ADP-ribose) and O-acetyl-ADP-D-ribose [[cite:PUB00100283], [cite:PUB00100284], [cite:PUB00100282]].</p>\n\n<p>The family also includes ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase Tri1 from Serratia proteamaculans. This protein neutralises Tre1-Sp both by occluding its active site via its N-terminal extension and by hydrolysing the ADP-ribosyl moiety from FtsZ. It functions as an immunity component of a contact-dependent interbacterial competition system (also called effector-immunity systems) [[cite:PUB00100280]].</p>\n\n<p>ADP-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] glycohydrolase is involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation activity by the reversible ADP-ribosylation of one subunit of the homodimeric dinitrogenase reductase component of the nitrogenase enzyme complex in Rhodospirillum rubrum [[cite:PUB00008413], [cite:PUB00052772]].</p>\n\n<p>Jellyfish Crystallin proteins [[cite:PUB00015931]] are also included in this group, although these proteins appear to have lost the presumed active site residues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2foz", "name" "human ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036705", "name" "ADP-ribosylation/Crystallin J1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03747" "ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation/Crystallin J1", "short" "Ribosyl_crysJ1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 448, "proteomes" 5897, "taxa" 24258, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 47969, "sets" 0, "proteins" 47047, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33944}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
