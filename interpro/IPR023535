{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase, includding RimN or YrdC (also known as TsaC) [[cite:PUB00063355]], which is involved in the biosynthesis of N6-threonyl-carbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) modified tRNA. This is a universal modification, found at position 37 of ANN decoding tRNAs. Analysis shows that YrdC binds ATP and preferentially binds tRNA-Thr lacking the t6A modification [[cite:PUB00054278]]. Furthermore YrdC has been shown to have threonine-dependent ATPase activity that generates AMP [[cite:PUB00063355]]. YrdC (TsaC) and proteins YgjD (TsaD), YjeE (TsaE), and YeaZ (TsaB), are necessary and sufficient for t6A biosynthesis in vitro, and may constitute a complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1hru", "name" "THE STRUCTURE OF THE YRDC GENE PRODUCT FROM E.COLI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017945", "name" "DHBP synthase RibB-like alpha/beta domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01852" "Threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase [tsaC]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase", "short" "TC-AMP_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1079, "taxa" 5848, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6333, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6333, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4919}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
