{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1 (LRRFIP1) is a transcriptional repressor which preferentially binds to the GC-rich consensus sequence (5'-AGCCCCCGGCG-3') and may regulate expression of TNF, EGFR and PDGFA [[cite:PUB00078055]]. It may control smooth muscle cell proliferation following artery injury through PDGFA repression and may also bind double-stranded RNA. It interacts with the leucine-rich repeat domain of human flightless-I (FliI) protein [[cite:PUB00078056]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 2 (LRRFIP2) may function as activator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, in association with DVL3, upstream of CTNNB1/beta-catenin [[cite:PUB00078057]]. It positively regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling in response to agonist probably by competing with the negative FLII regulator for MYD88-binding [[cite:PUB00078056]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09738" "LRRFIP family"}, "panther" {"PTHR19212" "LEUCINE RICH REPEAT IN FLII INTERACTING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1/2", "short" "LRRFIP1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 44, "proteomes" 1000, "taxa" 3982, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8554, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7980, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4422}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019139", :literature {"PUB00078055" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Suriano AR" "Sanford AN" "Kim N" "Oh M" "Kennedy S" "Henderson MJ" "Dietzmann K" "Sullivan KE."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
