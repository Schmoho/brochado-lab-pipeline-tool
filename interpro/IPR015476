{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The calcitonin (CT) gene is alternatively expressed in a tissue-specific manner, producing either the calcium regulatory hormone CT in the thyroid, or the neuropeptide calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the brain [[cite:PUB00001543]]. In medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, both peptides are produced [[cite:PUB00001543]].</p>\n\n<p>The calcitonin regulatory hormone is a peptide of 32 residues that causes a rapid but short-lived drop in calcium and phosphate levels in the blood by promoting the incorporation of these ions in the bones [[cite:PUB00000472]]. The structure of Oncorhynchus sp. (Salmon) calcitonin has been studied by 2D NMR in SDS micelles [[cite:PUB00000335]]. The main conformational feature of the hormone is an α-helix from residues 6-22, which includes an amphipathic segment. Two cysteine residues (at positions 1 and 7) form an N-terminal loop, and a C-terminal decapeptide forms a loop that folds back towards the helix [[cite:PUB00000335]].</p>\n\n<p>CGRP is a 37-residue peptide produced by alternative splicing of the CT gene. CGRP induces vasodilation in various vessels, including those of the coronary, cerebral and systemic vasculature. A neurotransmitter or neuro-modulator role is suggested by its abundance in the CNS [[cite:PUB00001543]]. The structure of human CGRP has been determined by 1H NMR [[cite:PUB00000353]]. The main conformational feature of the hormone is an N-terminal disulphide-bonded loop (residues 2-7), leading into a well-defined α-helix between residues 8 and 18; thereafter, the structure is predominantly disordered, although there are indications of a preference for a turn-type conformation between residues 19 and 21 [[cite:PUB00000353]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the full-length propeptide (procalcitonin gene-related peptide or proCGRP) before cleavage into the calcitonin peptide.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00817" "CALCITONINB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Calcitonin gene-related peptide", "short" "Calcitonin_gene-rel_peptide"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 308, "taxa" 1269, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 772, "sets" 0, "proteins" 764, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 496}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015476", :literature {"PUB00001543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Steenbergh PH" "Hoppener JW" "Zandberg J" "Lips CJ" "Jansz HS."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(85)80820-6", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "A second human calcitonin/CGRP gene.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "403-7", "volume" "183", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2985435}, "PUB00000472" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Breimer LH" "MacIntyre I" "Zaidi M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
