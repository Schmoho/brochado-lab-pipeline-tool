{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are small peptides found in the vicinity of a peptide modification-type radical SAM protein family, nearly always selenopeptides. Multiple members of this protein family occur in species with a selenocysteine incorporation systems and have a TGA stop codon at position that aligns with cysteine residues from other homologues. This finding strongly suggests that GSU_1558 and similar members of the family are selenopeptides. The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) finder bSECISearch finds two homologous SECIS elements for two TGA codons in the extension of GSU_1558, and multiple members of the SbtA family of more than two selenocysteine sites [[cite:PUB00055953]]. It was shown that the radical SAM enzyme SbtM removes two hydrogen atoms from sites with either Sec or Cys, creating a thio(seleno)oxazole moiety [[cite:PUB00106225]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04081" "SbtA family thio(seleno)oxazole RiPP natural product precursor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenoprotein GSU1558/SbtA-like", "short" "GSU1558/StbA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 165, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 97, "sets" 0, "proteins" 97, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0956", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0956"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023971", :literature {"PUB00055953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Basu MK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
