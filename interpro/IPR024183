{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arenaviridae produce four gene products: RNA-directed RNA polymerase, Z (zinc finger) protein, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and envelope glycoprotein precursor (which gives rise to mature proteins GP1 and GP2). The smallest protein is the Z protein (also called p11), which has molecular size of 11 kD. The Z protein has a zinc-binding RING-finger motif. It has been suggested that the Z-protein is a structural protein and is a component of the nucleocapsid. The arenavirus RING-finger Z protein is the main driving force of arenavirus budding, and myristoylation of its N terminus plays a key role [[cite:PUB00055573]]. Z proteins also possess, near their C-termini, PPxY and/or P(T/S)AP motifs. These same motifs are found in the M proteins of Ebola (and other negative stranded RNA) viruses, as well as in Gag proteins of retroviruses. They are called \"late budding domains\" or \"L domains\" (despite their short length), and are essential for viral budding. Arenaviruses do not possess the M (or matrix) protein, but the Z protein plays the same important role [[cite:PUB00055574]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038485", "name" "Protein Z, RING-type zinc finger superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004030" "Virion component RING-finger Z protein, Arenaviridae type"}, "hamap" {"MF_04087" "RING finger protein Z [Z]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RING finger protein Z, arenaviridae", "short" "RING_finger_Z_arenaviridae"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 79, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 588, "sets" 0, "proteins" 588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024183", :literature {"PUB00055573" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Perez M" "Greenwald DL" "de la Torre JC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
