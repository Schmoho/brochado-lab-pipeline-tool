{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Astrotactin-1 and 2 (ASTN1/2) are integral membrane perforin-like, vertebrate-specific proteins that play critical roles in neurodevelopment [[cite:PUB00091132], [cite:PUB00062133]]. They consist of an N-terminal cytosolic domain suspended between two transmembrane Î±-helices with a large C-terminal domain, extracellular for ASTN1 and endosome luminal for ASTN2. ASTN1 acts as a neuronal receptor for granule neuron migration along astroglial fibres [[cite:PUB00062132]]. ASTN2 forms a complex with ASTN1, which regulates the surface expression of ASTN1. It mediates ASTN1 recycling by promoting its internalisation and transport during endocytosis [[cite:PUB00062133]]. ASTN2 is also involved in the planar cell polarity pathway in hair cells [[cite:PUB00091132]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16592" "ASTROTACTIN-1-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Astrotactin", "short" "Astrotactin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 629, "taxa" 2132, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3378, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3378, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1556}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026995", :literature {"PUB00062132" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Fishell G" "Hatten ME."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Astrotactin provides a receptor system for CNS neuronal migration.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "755-65", "volume" "113", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1821847}, "PUB00062133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Wilson PM" "Fryer RH" "Fang Y" "Hatten ME."], "ISO_journal" "J.
