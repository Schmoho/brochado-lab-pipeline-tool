{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) catalyses the formation of carbamoyl-aspartate in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, by the association of aspartate and carbamoyl-phosphate. This is the commitment step in the Escherichia coli pathway and is regulated by feedback inhibition by CTP, the final product of the pathway [[cite:PUB00000720]].</p>\n\n<p>The structural organisation of the ATCase protein varies considerably between different organisms. In bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Serratia marcescens, the ATCase is a dodecamer of 2 catalytic (c) trimers and 3 regulatory (r) dimers. The catalytic domains are coded for by the pyrB gene [[cite:PUB00002421]], and the regulatory domains by pyrI [[cite:PUB00070200]]. In Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, ATCase exists as a trimer of catalytic subunits, but unlike in E. coli, it neither contains nor binds to regulatory subunits. In eukaryotes, ATCase is found as a single domain in a multifunctional enzyme that contains activity for glutamine amidotransferase, carbamoylphosphate synthetase, dihydroorotase, and aspartate carbamoyltransferase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ml4", "name" "The PALA-liganded Aspartate transcarbamoylase catalytic subunit from Pyrococcus abyssi"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036901", "name" "Aspartate/ornithine carbamoyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00001" "Aspartate carbamoyltransferase [pyrB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00670" "aspartate carbamoyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartate carbamoyltransferase", "short" "Asp_carbamoyltransf"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 117, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11103, "taxa" 42425, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45089, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45089, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32350}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1427", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1427"} {"accession" "GenProp1614", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1614"} {"accession" "GenProp1418", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1418"} {"accession" "GenProp0187", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0187"} {"accession" "GenProp1172", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1172"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
