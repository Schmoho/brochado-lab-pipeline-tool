{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the PdxA family. PdxA is an NAD+-dependent 4-hydroxythreonine 4-phosphate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.262]) active in pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00022460]]. PdxA2, a functional paralogue of PdxA, catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation and subsequent decarboxylation of D-erythronate 4-phosphate to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). It can also use D-threonate 4-phosphate as substrate [[cite:PUB00083215], [cite:PUB00085179]]. This family also includes TphB, involved in terephthalate degradation [[cite:PUB00085180]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6e85", "name" "1.25 Angstrom Resolution Crystal Structure of 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate Dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30004" "4-HYDROXYTHREONINE-4-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE"}, "pfam" {"PF04166" "Pyridoxal phosphate biosynthetic protein PdxA"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00557" "4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase PdxA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PdxA family", "short" "PdxA_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 45, "proteomes" 5713, "taxa" 23329, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32727, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25069}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1633", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1633"} {"accession" "GenProp0862", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0862"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
