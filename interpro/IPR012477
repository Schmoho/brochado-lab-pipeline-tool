{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family features glycosyltransferases belonging to glycosyltransferase family 52 [[cite:PUB00015209]], which have alpha-2,3- sialyltransferase ([ec:4.2.99.4]) and alpha-glucosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1]) activity. For example, beta-galactoside alpha-2,3- sialyltransferase expressed by Neisseria meningitidis ([swissprot:P72097]) is a member of this family and is involved in a step of lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis requiring sialic acid transfer; these lipooligosaccharides are thought to be important in the process of pathogenesis [[cite:PUB00016379]]. This family includes several bacterial lipooligosaccharide sialyltransferases similar to the Haemophilus ducreyi LST protein. Haemophilus ducreyi is the cause of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid and produces a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) containing a terminal sialyl N-acetyllactosamine trisaccharide [[cite:PUB00011366]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2yk4", "name" "Structure of Neisseria LOS-specific sialyltransferase (NST)."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07922" "Glycosyltransferase family 52"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyltransferase family 52", "short" "Glyco_transf_52"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 916, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1013, "sets" 0, "proteins" 998, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 821}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
