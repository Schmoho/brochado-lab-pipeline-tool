{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of lactocin 705 which is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus casei CRL 705. Lactocin 705 is a class IIb bacteriocin, whose activity depends upon the complementation of two peptides (705-alpha and 705-beta) of 33 amino acid residues each. Lactocin 705 is active against several Gram-positive bacteria, including food-borne pathogens and is a good candidate to be used for biopreservation of fermented meats [[cite:PUB00016503]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08109" "Lactocin 705 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lactocin 705", "short" "Antimicrobial14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 25, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012517", :literature {"PUB00016503" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Cuozzo SA" "Sesma F" "Palacios JM" "de Ruiz Holgado AP" "Raya RR."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
