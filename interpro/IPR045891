{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the zinc transporter ZIP9 from eukaryotes. It also includes metal homeostasis factor ATX2 from yeast, which is involved in homeostasis of manganese ions. Some bacterial and archaeal zinc transporters are also included in this entry.</p>\n\n<p>In humans, ZIP9 is one of the 14 members of the ZIP (ZRT-and Irt-like Protein, SLC39A) family that regulates zinc homeostasis by transporting zinc across cell and organelle membranes into the cytoplasm. ZIP9 plays an important role in the activation of Akt and Erk in response to B cell-receptor activation [[cite:PUB00099211]]. It has been shown to mediate rapid testosterone-dependent signaling, zinc influx, and apoptosis in breast and prostate cancer cell lines [[cite:PUB00099212]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16133" "SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 ZINC TRANSPORTER , MEMBER 9-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc transporter ZIP9", "short" "ZIP9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2191, "taxa" 7546, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4285, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4285, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2855}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045891", :literature {"PUB00099211" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Taniguchi M" "Fukunaka A" "Hagihara M" "Watanabe K" "Kamino S" "Kambe T" "Enomoto S" "Hiromura M."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Essential role of the zinc transporter ZIP9/SLC39A9 in regulating the activations of Akt and Erk in B-cell receptor signaling pathway in DT40 cells.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e58022", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23505453}, "PUB00099212" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Thomas P" "Dong J."], "ISO_journal" "Steroids", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Steroids", "title" "Novel mechanism of endocrine disruption by fungicides through binding to the membrane androgen receptor, ZIP9 (SLC39A9), and antagonizing rapid testosterone induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "108415", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31152826}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046873", "name" "metal ion transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006829", "name" "zinc ion transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003689", "name" "Zinc/iron permease", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004698", "name" "Zinc/iron permease, fungal/plant", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023498", "name" "Zinc transporter ZupT", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045891", "name" "Zinc transporter ZIP9", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
