{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The precise function of this protein is unknown. However, it is thought that this entry represents the gasdermin family which plays a role as a secretory or metabolic product involved in the secretory pathway and includes gasdermins A-E (GSDMA-E).  A N-terminal fragment released by proteolysis of gasmerdin A binds to lipids and homo-oligomerizes in the membrane forming pores, which may have a bactericidal function [[cite:PUB00088058]].</p>\n\n<p>GSDMB (GSDM) may play a role in achieving and maintaining the final differentiation state of epithelial cells [[cite:PUB00053860], [cite:PUB00053861]]. A deletion/insertion mutation in GSDMB (DFNA5) is associated with an autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment form [[cite:PUB00010076]].</p>\n\n<p>Certain gasdermins are cleaved by inflammatory and apoptotic caspases [[cite:PUB00091059]]. Gasmedin E is cleaved by caspase-3 and the N-terminal fragment released forms pores in the cell membrane, switching from cell death by apoptosis to pyroptosis [[cite:PUB00088060]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7z1x", "name" "Crystal structure of human Gasdermin D complexed with nanobodies VHH-2 and VHH-6"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16399" "GASDERMIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gasdermin", "short" "Gasdermin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 383, "taxa" 1326, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 1481, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1481, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 919}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007677", :literature {"PUB00053861" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Carl-McGrath S" "Schneider-Stock R" "Ebert M" "Rocken C."], "ISO_journal" "Pathology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00313020701716250", "medline_journal" "Pathology", "title" "Differential expression and localisation of gasdermin-like (GSDML), a novel member of the cancer-associated GSDMDC protein family, in neoplastic and non-neoplastic gastric, hepatic, and colon tissues.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "13-24", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18038310}, "PUB00010076" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Van Laer L" "Huizing EH" "Verstreken M" "van Zuijlen D" "Wauters JG" "Bossuyt PJ" "Van de Heyning P" "McGuirt WT" "Smith RJ" "Willems PJ" "Legan PK" "Richardson GP" "Van Camp G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
