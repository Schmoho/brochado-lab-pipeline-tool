{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Representatives of this family include a 13-member paralogous family of proteins about 215 amino acids in length from the termite gut bacterium Opitutaceae bacterium TAV2, a member of the Verrucomicrobia. Family members contain an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal PEP-CTERM putative protein sorting signal. Conserved residues such as an invariant Arg and a lack of conspicuous low-complexity sequence suggest a globular structure and possible enzymatic activity. Members average about thirty percent sequence identify overall, but over seventy percent in the PEP-CTERM region. The function of this family is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04254" "putative globular PEP-CTERM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative globular PEP-CTERM protein", "short" "Glob_PEP-CTERM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 12, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026348", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026348", "name" "Putative globular PEP-CTERM protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
