{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a group of proteins from bacteria and archaea, which belong to the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family) [[cite:PUB00102222], [cite:PUB00102220]], such as pyruvate oxidase (POXB) from Lactobacillus plantarum which decarboxylates pyruvate, producing hydrogen peroxide and the energy-storage metabolite acetylphosphate [[cite:PUB00102223]]. This entry also includes a closely homologous member, pyruvate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] PoxB from Escherichia coli, a peripheral membrane protein that catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of the central metabolite pyruvate to CO(2) and acetate.
