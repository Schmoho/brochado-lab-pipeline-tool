{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Ctk3 from fungi.</p>\n\n<p>CTDK-I complex is a three-subunit complex comprised of Ctk1, Ctk2, and Ctk3, that plays a key role in regulation of transcription and translation and in coordinating these two processes. Both Ctk2 and Ctk3 are regulated at the level of protein turnover, and are unstable proteins processed through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Their physical interaction is required to protect both subunits from degradation, and both Ctk2 and Ctk3 are required for Ctk1 CTD kinase activation [[cite:PUB00053283]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ce7", "name" "Structure of a non-canonical CID of Ctk3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008942", "name" "ENTH/VHS", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28291" "CTD KINASE SUBUNIT GAMMA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CTD kinase subunit gamma", "short" "Ctk3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1111, "taxa" 3034, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1636, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1636, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1027}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042326", :literature {"PUB00053283" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Hautbergue G" "Goguel V."], "ISO_journal" "J.
