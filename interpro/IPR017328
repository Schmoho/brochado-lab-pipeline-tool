{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents eukaryotic type sirtuin-2 (Sir2, or silent information regulator) family of NAD-dependent deacetylases, which are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzymes that hydrolyse one molecule of NAD+ for every lysine residue that is deacetylated [[cite:PUB00044690]]. The sirtuins are phylogenetically conserved in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archeal species. Sir2 itself deacetylates Lys-40 of alpha-tubulin, and is involved in the control of mitotic exit in the cell cycle, probably via its role in the regulation of cytoskeleton [[cite:PUB00044691]]. Other members of this family could function in telomeric silencing, cell cycle progression, chromosome stability, and/or as a regulator of gene expression through the modification of chromatin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4rmh", "name" "Human Sirt2 in complex with SirReal2 and Ac-Lys-H3 peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029035", "name" "DHS-like NAD/FAD-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037938" "NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-2, eukaryotic type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sirtuin, class I", "short" "Sirtuin_class_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 103, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1386, "taxa" 5077, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2750, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2660, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1795}, "pathways" 229}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
