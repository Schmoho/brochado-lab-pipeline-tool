{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Aquarius, which is a pre-mRNA splicing factor and has RNA helicase activity. It is responsible for coupling snoRNP (small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein) assembly to intron excision [[cite:PUB00056687]]. Aquarius also contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability via regulation of homologous recombination by CtIP-dependent and -independent pathways [[cite:PUB00088394]]. This family also includes pre-mRNA-splicing factor cwf11, which associates with cdc5 and the other cwf proteins as part of the spliceosome and is involved in mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00008533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038901" "Intron-binding spliceosome component aquarius/cwf11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CWF11 family", "short" "CWF11_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1778, "taxa" 6199, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3657, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3151, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 102}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
