{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ZFYVE1, also termed double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) is a novel tandem FYVE domain containing protein that binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P or PI3P) with high specificity over other phosphoinositides. The subcellular distribution of exogenously-expressed ZFYVE1 to Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vesicular is governed in part by its FYVE domains but unaffected by Wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor. It plays a role in the formation of lipid droplets (LDs), regulating their morphology, size and distribution which are storage organelles, central to lipid and energy homeostasis [[cite:PUB00151091], [cite:PUB00151090]].</p>\n\n<p>ZFYVE1 harbors two B-box domains, both of which show high sequence similarity with B-Box-type 1 zinc finger found in tripartite motif-containing proteins (TRIMs). The type 1 B-box (Bbox1) zinc finger is characterised by a C6H2 zinc-binding consensus motif [[cite:PUB00042931], [cite:PUB00133686], [cite:PUB00133687], [cite:PUB00133688]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46624" "AGAP002036-PA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 1", "short" "ZFYV1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 861, "taxa" 3467, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2340, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2340, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1542}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042427", :literature {"PUB00151091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Li D" "Zhao YG" "Li D" "Zhao H" "Huang J" "Miao G" "Feng D" "Liu P" "Li D" "Zhang H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "The ER-Localized Protein DFCP1 Modulates ER-Lipid Droplet Contact Formation.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "343-358.e5", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30970241}, "PUB00151090" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Gao G" "Sheng Y" "Yang H" "Chua BT" "Xu L."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Biol Int", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Biol Int", "title" "DFCP1 associates with lipid droplets.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1492-1504", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31293035}, "PUB00042931" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 22", "authors" ["Ridley SH" "Ktistakis N" "Davidson K" "Anderson KE" "Manifava M" "Ellson CD" "Lipp P" "Bootman M" "Coadwell J" "Nazarian A" "Erdjument-Bromage H" "Tempst P" "Cooper MA" "Thuring JW" "Lim ZY" "Holmes AB" "Stephens LR" "Hawkins PT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
