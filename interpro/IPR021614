{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sec31 is involved in COPII coat formation as it forms through the sequential binding of three cytoplasmic proteins: Sar1, Sec23/24 and Sec13/31. Sec13/31 is recruited by the pre-budding complex and polymerisation of Sec13/31 occurs to form an octahedral cage that is the outer shell of the COPII coat [[cite:PUB00049141]]. Sec13/31 is a hetero-tetramer which is organised as a linear array of α-solenoid and β-propeller domains to form a rod in which twenty-four copies assemble to form the COPII cub-octahedron [[cite:PUB00049141]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11549" "Protein transport protein SEC31"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein transport protein SEC31", "short" "Sec31"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 64, "sets" 0, "proteins" 64, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021614", :literature {"PUB00049141" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bi X" "Mancias JD" "Goldberg J."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
