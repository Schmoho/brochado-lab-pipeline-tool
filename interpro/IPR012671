{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are found exclusively in type III secretion apparatus gene clusters in bacteria. Those bacteria with a protein from this family tend to target animal cells, as does Yersinia pestis [[cite:PUB00020581], [cite:PUB00039043], [cite:PUB00048615]]. This is a small protein (about 70 amino acids) known as YscE in Y. pestis, SsaE of Salmonella spp., PscE of P. aeruginosa, AscE of A. hydrophila and EscE in Edwardsiella piscicida. They are described as the chaperones of the type III secretion (T3S) injectisome that translocates effector toxins into host cells, facilitating the establishment and dissemination of infection. EscE forms a complex with EsaH which interacts with EsaG, stabilizing it and therefore, controlling T3SS protein secretion as EsaG secretion itself leads to the secretion of the middle and late T3SS substrates [[cite:PUB00106879]]. PscE prevents premature polymerization of PscF, along with PscG, within the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00106882], [cite:PUB00106879]], it is required for type III secretion needle assembly and also for cytotoxicity by influencing PscF levels.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2p58", "name" "Structure of the Yersinia pestis Type III secretion system needle protein YscF in complex with its chaperones YscE/YscG"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08988" "Type III secretion system, cytoplasmic E component of needle"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02501" "EscE/YscE/SsaE family type III secretion system needle protein co-chaperone"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III export protein PscE/YscE", "short" "T3SS_PscE/YscE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 77, "taxa" 896, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 849, "sets" 0, "proteins" 849, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 705}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012671", :literature {"PUB00048615" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sun P" "Tropea JE" "Austin BP" "Cherry S" "Waugh DS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
