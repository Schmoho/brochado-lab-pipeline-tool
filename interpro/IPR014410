{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents adenoviral early E1A proteins. The E1A protein is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the early genes with in the viral genome at the start of the infection process as well as some cellular genes [[cite:PUB00007569]].</p>\r\n<p>E1A disrupts the function of host retinoblastoma protein RB1/pRb, which is a key regulator of the cell cycle [[cite:PUB00073488]]. It also induces the disassembly of the E2F1 transcription factors from RB1 by direct competition for the same binding site on RB1, with subsequent transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes [[cite:PUB00073486]]. Inactivation of the ability of RB1 to arrest the cell cycle is critical for cellular transformation, uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation induced by viral infection. The stimulation of the progression from G1 to S phase allows the virus to efficiently use the cellular DNA replicating machinery to achieve viral genome replication.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02703" "Early E1A protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003669" "Adenovirus early E1A protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus early E1A protein", "short" "Aden_E1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 222, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 854, "sets" 0, "proteins" 739, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014410", :literature {"PUB00073486" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Chellappan S" "Kraus VB" "Kroger B" "Munger K" "Howley PM" "Phelps WC" "Nevins JR."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
