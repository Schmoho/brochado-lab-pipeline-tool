{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the coenzyme PQQ (pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone) biosynthesis protein PqqC and its related protein, CADD. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is the prosthetic group of several bacterial enzymes, including methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and the glucose dehydrogenase of a number of bacteria [[cite:PUB00010477]]. PQQC is an oxidase whose reaction involves a ring closure and eight-electron oxidation of its substrate (AHQQ) to produce PQQ [[cite:PUB00088860]].</p>\n\n<p>Chlamidia specific toxin CADD, also known as PqqC-like protein, which induces apoptosis in mammalian cell lines [[cite:PUB00030611]]. BesC from Streptomyces cattleya, shows homology to CADD, has been shown to catalyse formation of 4-Cl-allylglycine from 4-Cl-lysine and requires Fe(II) as a cofactor [[cite:PUB00093050]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bjd", "name" "Crystal structure of putative 3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016084", "name" "Haem oxygenase-like, multi-helical", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40279" "PQQC-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyrroloquinoline-quinone synthase-like", "short" "PqqC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1798, "taxa" 8733, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10977, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10977, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8613}, "pathways" 24}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
