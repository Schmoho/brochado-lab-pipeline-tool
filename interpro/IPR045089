{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Prenyltransferases catalyze the covalent attachment of isoprenoid lipids (farnesyl or geranylgeranyl) to a cysteine near the C terminus of their substrates. This entry includes geranylgeranyl transferase type-1/2 subunit beta (Cdc43/Bet2) and farnesyltransferase subunit beta (Ram1). Cdc43/Bet2 catalyzes the transfer of a geranyl-geranyl moiety from geranyl-geranyl diphosphate to proteins having the C-terminal sequence Cys-Ile-Ile-Leu or Cys-Val-Leu-Leu [[cite:PUB00098019]]. Ram1 catalyzes the transfer of a farnesyl moiety from farnesyl diphosphate to a cysteine at the fourth position from the C terminus of several proteins having the C-terminal sequence Cys-aliphatic-aliphatic-X where X is Ser, Ala, Met, Cys, or Gln [[cite:PUB00098018]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3dra", "name" "Candida albicans protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I complexed with GGPP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008930", "name" "Terpenoid cyclases/protein prenyltransferase alpha-alpha toroid", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11774" "GERANYLGERANYL TRANSFERASE TYPE BETA SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prenyltransferase subunit beta", "short" "PGGT1B-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 119, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2821, "taxa" 10112, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14086, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14086, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9290}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
