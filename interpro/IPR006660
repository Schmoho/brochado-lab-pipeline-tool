{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Several bacterial taxon have a chromosomal resistance system, encoded by the ars operon, for the detoxification of arsenate, arsenite, and antimonite [[cite:PUB00043811]]. This system transports arsenite and antimonite out of the cell. The pump is composed of two polypeptides, the products of the arsA and arsB genes. This two-subunit enzyme produces resistance to arsenite and antimonite. Arsenate, however, must first be reduced to arsenite before it is extruded. A third gene, arsC, expands the substrate specificity to allow for arsenate pumping and resistance. ArsC is an approximately 150-residue arsenate reductase that uses reduced glutathione (GSH) to convert arsenate to arsenite with a redox active cysteine residue in the active site. ArsC forms an active quaternary complex with GSH, arsenate, and glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1).  The three ligands must be present simultaneously for reduction to occur [[cite:PUB00043812]].</p>\n\n<p>The arsC family also comprises the Spx proteins which are GRAM-positive bacterial transcription factors that regulate the transcription of multiple genes in response to disulphide stress [[cite:PUB00043813], [cite:PUB00095599]].</p>\n\n<p>The arsC protein structure has been solved [[cite:PUB00025947]]. It belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily fold which is defined by a β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices. The active cysteine residue of ArsC is located in the loop between the first  β-strand and the first helix, which is also conserved in the Spx protein and its homologues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rw1", "name" "YFFB (PA3664) PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30041" "ARSENATE REDUCTASE"}, "profile" {"PS51353" "ArsC family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF03960" "ArsC family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenate reductase-like", "short" "Arsenate_reductase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 64, "proteomes" 7260, "taxa" 27690, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 52610, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52610, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 40602}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
