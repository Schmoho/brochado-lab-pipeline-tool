{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) [ec:2.7.1.19] catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose-5-phosphate to ribulose-1,5-phosphate, a key step in the pentose phosphate pathway where carbon dioxide is assimilated by autotrophic organisms [[cite:PUB00000332]]. In general, plant enzymes are light-activated by the thioredoxin/ferredoxin system, while those from photosynthetic bacteria are regulated by a system that has an absolute requirement for NADH. Thioredoxin/ferredoxin regulation is mediated by the reversible oxidation/reduction of sulphydryl and disulphide groups. In the spinach enzyme ([swissprot:P09559]) the participating residues are Cys-16 and Cys-55. Sequence analysis shows the first of these cysteines to be present in the ATP-binding site [[cite:PUB00002460]]; neither is found in the bacterial sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00478" "PHRIBLKINASE"}, "prosite" {"PS00567" "Phosphoribulokinase signature"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoribulokinase", "short" "PRK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1775, "taxa" 9274, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31921, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8463, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6375}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00490", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00490"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
