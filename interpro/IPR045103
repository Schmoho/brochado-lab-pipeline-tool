{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of RING membrane-anchor proteins, including RNF5/RNF185 from humans and AtRMA1/AtRMA2/AtRMA3 from Arabidopsis. They contain a RING finger motif and a C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain. RNF5 and RNF185 are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases [[cite:PUB00098040], [cite:PUB00098039]].</p>\n\n<p>AtRMA1, AtRMA2, and AtRMA3, are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Arabidopsis homologues of human outer membrane of the ER-anchor E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, RING finger protein 5 (RNF5) [[cite:PUB00098041]]. AtRMAs possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and may play a role in the growth and development of Arabidopsis. The AtRMA1 and AtRMA3 genes are predominantly expressed in major tissues, such as cotyledons, leaves, shoot-root junction, roots, and anthers, while AtRMA2 expression is restricted to the root tips and leaf hydathodes. AtRma1 probably functions with the Ubc4/5 subfamily of E2. AtRMA2 is likely involved in the cellular regulation of ABP1 expression levels through interacting with auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1). AtRMA proteins contain an N-terminal C3HC4-type RING-HC finger and a trans-membrane-anchoring domain in their extreme C-terminal region [[cite:PUB00064253]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12313" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE RNF5-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF5/RNF185-like", "short" "RNF5/RNF185-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1550, "taxa" 6230, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4499}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
