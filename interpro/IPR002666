{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the reduced folate carrier family, including folate transporter 1 (SLC19A1), thiamine transporter 1 (SLC19A2) and thiamine transporter 2 (SLC19A3). Despite their protein sequence/structure similarity, they have different functions.</p>\n\n<p>The transporter 1 (SLC19A1, also known as the reduced folate carrier protein, RFC) transports reduced folate into mammalian cells via the carrier mediated mechanism (as opposed to the receptor mediated mechanism) it also transports cytotoxic folate analogues used in chemotherapy [[cite:PUB00001873]], such as methotrexate (MTX). It also transports cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) into cells which is involved in the modulation of the immune response [[cite:PUB00095223]]. Mammalian cells have an absolute requirement for exogenous folates which are needed for growth, and biosynthesis of macromolecules [[cite:PUB00001873]].</p>\n\n<p>Thiamine transporter 1 (SLC19A2) and thiamine transporter 2 (SLC19A3) are high-affinity transporters for the intake of thiamine [[cite:PUB00068067]]. They do not transport reduced or oxidized folates.</p>\n\n<p>Also included in this entry is Putative solute carrier family 19 member 4 which has been defined as pseudogene in HGNC. It lacks the transmembrane region, suggesting that it has probably no transporter function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01770" "Reduced folate carrier"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF028739" "Folate/thiamine transporter"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00806" "reduced folate carrier"}, "panther" {"PTHR10686" "FOLATE TRANSPORTER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Reduced folate carrier", "short" "Folate_carrier"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 75, "proteomes" 1010, "taxa" 4019, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5822, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5406, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3767}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002666", :literature {"PUB00001873" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tolner B" "Roy K" "Sirotnak FM."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(96)00676-2", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Organization, structure and alternate splicing of the murine RFC-1 gene encoding a folate transporter.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "1-7", "volume" "189", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9161403}, "PUB00068067" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rajgopal A" "Edmondnson A" "Goldman ID" "Zhao R."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
