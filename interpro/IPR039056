{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of Cdc42-binding proteins known as SPECs (for small protein effector of Cdc42), including SPEC1 and SPEC2 from humans. SPECs modulate the activity of the Rho GTPase Cdc42, which plays important roles in actin polymerization and kinase signaling [[cite:PUB00089508]]. SPEC1 and SPEC2 play a role in F-actin accumulation in activated T lymphocytes and may play a role in early contractile events in phagocytosis [[cite:PUB00088841]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036936", "name" "CRIB domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13502" "CDC42 SMALL EFFECTOR PROTEIN HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CDC42 small effector protein", "short" "SPEC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 918, "taxa" 3708, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2370, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2370, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1646}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039056", :literature {"PUB00089508" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Pirone DM" "Fukuhara S" "Gutkind JS" "Burbelo PD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
