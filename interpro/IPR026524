{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus protein G6d and G6f, which are encoded in the MHC (major histocompatibility complex). Human and mouse G6d was found to be GPI-anchored cell surface proteins, highly expressed at the leading edges of cells, on filopodia, which are normally involved in cell adhesion and migration. The human G6f protein may play a role in the downstream signal transduction pathways involving GRB2 and GRB7, including the Ras-MAP kinase pathway [[cite:PUB00060557]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32286" "LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 6 COMPLEX LOCUS PROTEIN G6F"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus protein G6d/G6f", "short" "LY6G6d/LY6G6f"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 150, "taxa" 545, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 412, "sets" 0, "proteins" 412, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 274}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026524", :literature {"PUB00060557" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["De Vet EC" "Aguado B" "Campbell RD."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
