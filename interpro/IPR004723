{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AONS) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the decarboxylative condensation of L-alanine with pimeloyl-CoA to form 8(S)-amino-7-oxononanoate. This is the first committed step in biotin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00024209]]:<reaction>6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA + L-alanine = 8-amino-7-oxononanoate + CoA + CO2</reaction></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The enzyme is a symmetrical homodimer with a tertiary structure and active site organisation similar to, but distinct from, those of other PLP-dependent enzymes with known structures. AONS is a critical PLP-binding lysine at the end of a deep cleft that allows access to the pantothenate arm of pimeloyl-CoA. There is a cluster of positively charged residues at the entrance to this cleft, which forms a putative diphosphate binding site for CoA [[cite:PUB00023713]]. Trifluoroalanine irreversibly inhibits this enzyme [[cite:PUB00040947]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthases mainly from Proteobacteria and Archaea.
