{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a group of uncharacterised proteins found mainly in cyanobacteria. Some members have a PEP-CTERM sequence at the C-terminal ([interpro:IPR013424]), but are unusual among PEP-CTERM proteins in having multiple predicted transmembrane segments. The function is unknown. It is proposed that a member of the EpsH family, to be designated exosortase (see [interpro:IPR013426]), recognises and cleaves PEP-CTERM proteins in a manner analogous to the cleavage of LPXTG proteins by sortase [[cite:PUB00034422]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02921" "TIGR02921 family PEP-CTERM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PEP-CTERM integral membrane protein", "short" "PEP-CTERM_IMP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 59, "taxa" 428, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 239, "sets" 0, "proteins" 237, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 129}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014270", :literature {"PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
