{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase is a [4FE-4S] protein present in organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis, and plays an important role in the ferredoxin/thioredoxin regulatory chain. It converts an electron signal (photoreduced ferredoxin) to a thiol signal (reduced thioredoxin), regulating enzymes by reduction of specific disulphide groups. It catalyses the light-dependent activation of several photosynthetis enzymes. Ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase is a heterodimer of subunit alpha and subunit beta.
