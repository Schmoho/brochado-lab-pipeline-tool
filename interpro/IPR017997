{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Vinculin is an actin filament (F-actin) binding protein involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell adhesion [[cite:PUB00000977]]. In addition to actin, vinculin interacts with other structural proteins such as talin and alpha-actinins [[cite:PUB00085941]].</p>\n\n<p>Vinculin is a large protein of 116kDa (about a 1000 residues). Structurally the protein consists of an acidic N-terminal domain of about 90kDa separated from a basic C-terminal domain of about 25kDa by a proline-rich region of about 50 residues. The central part of the N-terminal domain consists of a variable number (3 in vertebrates, 2 in Caenorhabditis elegans) of repeats of a 110 amino acids domain. Interestingly, vinculin exists in two conformations in the cell: an open, active form and a closed, auto-inhibited state in which the head domain forms extensive interactions with the tail [[cite:PUB00085941]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rf3", "name" "Shigella IpaA-VBS3 in complex with human vinculin"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46180" "VINCULIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vinculin", "short" "Vinculin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 50, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1033, "taxa" 4191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3435, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2047}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017997", :literature {"PUB00085941" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Bays JL" "DeMali KA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
