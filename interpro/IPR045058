Toc proteins function as integral components of the chloroplast protein import machinery. The Toc translocon contains the two membrane-bound GTPases Toc33/34 and Toc 159, which expose their G domains to the cytosol that recognise and then deliver precursor proteins through the translocation pore Toc75 [[cite:PUB00047782], [cite:PUB00050571]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xtm", "name" "Crystal structure of GDP-bound human GIMAP2, amino acid residues 1- 234"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10903" "GTPASE, IMAP FAMILY MEMBER-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GTPase GIMA/IAN/Toc", "short" "GIMA/IAN/Toc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1353, "taxa" 5042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25549, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25549, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13886}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
