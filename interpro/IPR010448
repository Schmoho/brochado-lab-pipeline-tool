{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Torsins are membrane-associated ATPases. They belong to the AAA+ (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) superfamily of ATPases, but they lack conserved catalytic residues typically found in related ATPases. Accordingly, Torsins do not display ATPase activity unless they are engaged by their regulatory cofactors lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) or luminal domain-like LAP1 (LULL1) [[cite:PUB00073002], [cite:PUB00098745], [cite:PUB00098746]], which are type II transmembrane proteins located in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [[cite:PUB00073003]]. LAP1 and LULL1 integrate into the Torsin ring to produce the biologically active ATPase machine [[cite:PUB00073001]].</p>\n\n<p>Torsion dystonia is an autosomal dominant movement disorder characterised by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions and twisted postures. The most severe early-onset form of dystonia has been linked to mutations in the human DYT1 (TOR1A) gene encoding a protein termed torsinA. While causative genetic alterations have been identified, the function of torsin proteins and the molecular mechanism underlying dystonia remain unknown. It has been suggested that torsins play a role in effectively managing protein folding and that possible breakdown in a neuroprotective mechanism that is, in part, mediated by torsins may be responsible for the neuronal dysfunction associated with dystonia [[cite:PUB00098745], [cite:PUB00012318]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5j1s", "name" "TorsinA-LULL1 complex, H. sapiens, bound to VHH-BS2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06309" "Torsin"}, "panther" {"PTHR10760" "TORSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Torsin", "short" "Torsin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 65, "proteomes" 1117, "taxa" 4532, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6243, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6154, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4257}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
