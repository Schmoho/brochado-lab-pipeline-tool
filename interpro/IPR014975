{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family appears to be primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. Members of this family, such as the one represented by [swissprot:Q8E4L3] (gene gbs1388), exhibit high levels of transcriptional activity and may be regulated by factors like the rex gene, indicating a role in significant cellular processes [[cite:PUB00156067]]. Another member, [swissprot:A6M310] (gene name cbei_4884), is implicated in strain degeneration and regulatory functions linked to sporulation and solvent formation in Clostridium beijerinckii, suggesting conservation among clostridial species [[cite:PUB00156068]]. The sgo_1308 gene encodes a protein ([swissprot:A8AXS9]) containing the DUF1836 domain, which belongs to the helix-turn-helix (HTH) clan, hinting at its role in transcriptional regulation, specifically influencing bacterial hemolysins III [[cite:PUB00156066]]. Overall, this protein family is characterised by domain structures that suggest roles in DNA binding and regulatory functions across various bacterial species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40056" "HYPOTHETICAL CYTOSOLIC PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF08876" "Domain of unknown function (DUF1836)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1836", "short" "DUF1836"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 1020, "taxa" 3776, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4932, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4907, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3701}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014975", :literature {"PUB00156066" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jakubovics NS" "Robinson JC" "Samarian DS" "Kolderman E" "Yassin SA" "Bettampadi D" "Bashton M" "Rickard AH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.13023", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Critical roles of arginine in growth and biofilm development by Streptococcus gordonii.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "281-300", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25855127}, "PUB00156067" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Franza T" "Rogstam A" "Thiyagarajan S" "Sullivan MJ" "Derre-Bobillot A" "Bauer MC" "Goh KGK" "Da Cunha V" "Glaser P" "Logan DT" "Ulett GC" "von Wachenfeldt C" "Gaudu P."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009791", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "NAD+ pool depletion as a signal for the Rex regulon involved in Streptococcus agalactiae virulence.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e1009791", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34370789}, "PUB00156068" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Humphreys JR" "Debebe BJ" "Diggle SP" "Winzer K."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1075609", "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "<i>Clostridium beijerinckii</i> strain degeneration is driven by the loss of Spo0A activity.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "1075609", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36704551}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014975", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1836", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 28, "alignment:full" 1234}}}
