{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins synthesised on the ribosome and processed in the endoplasmic reticulum are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and from there via small carrier vesicles to their final destination compartment. This traffic is bidirectional, to ensure that proteins required to form vesicles are recycled. Vesicles have specific coat proteins (such as clathrin or coatomer) that are important for cargo selection and direction of transfer [[cite:PUB00035769], [cite:PUB00103198]]. While clathrin mediates endocytic protein transport, and transport from ER to Golgi, coatomers primarily mediate intra-Golgi transport, as well as the reverse Golgi to ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins [[cite:PUB00030524]]. For example, the coatomer COP1 (coat protein complex 1) is responsible for reverse transport of recycled proteins from Golgi and pre-Golgi compartments back to the ER, while COPII buds vesicles from the ER to the Golgi [[cite:PUB00035767]]. Coatomers reversibly associate with Golgi (non-clathrin-coated) vesicles to mediate protein transport and for budding from Golgi membranes [[cite:PUB00035768]]. COPI coated vesicle assembly is initiated by recruitment of the small GTPase Arf1 which recruits the coatomer protein complex from the cytoplasm and anchors it at the membrane. Then, Arf1 is activated by a guanine exchange factor and hydrolyses GTP to mediate uncoating of the vesicle which subsequently fuses with its target membrane [[cite:PUB00103198], [cite:PUB00100149]]. As coat proteins polymerise, vesicles are formed and budded from membrane-bound organelles. Coatomer complexes also influence Golgi structural integrity, as well as the processing, activity, and endocytic recycling of LDL receptors. In mammals, coatomer complexes can only be recruited by membranes associated to ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small GTP-binding proteins. Coatomer complexes are hetero-oligomers composed of at least an alpha, beta, beta', gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta subunits, and can be subdivided into an outer-coat and an adaptor subcomplex [[cite:PUB00103198]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents coatomer subunit alpha, a component of the coatomer, which is a cytosolic protein complex involved in biosynthetic protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells.
