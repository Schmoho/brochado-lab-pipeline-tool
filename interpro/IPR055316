{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Radial spoke head protein 9 homolog (RSPH9) is involved in the assembly and function of axonemal radial spoke complexes, which are crucial for the motility of sperm and cilia [[cite:PUB00092583], [cite:PUB00155348], [cite:PUB00153060], [cite:PUB00155349]]. Members of this family are essential for radial spoke head assembly and central pair microtubule stability, impacting the motility of olfactory and neural cilia. They also play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of ciliary axonemes in both 9+0 and 9+2 motile cilia, which are important for the proper functioning of ependymal motile cilia [[cite:PUB00155347]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22069" "MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S18"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radial spoke head protein 9 homolog", "short" "RSP9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1022, "taxa" 4045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1809, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1809, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1271}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055316", :literature {"PUB00155348" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zheng W" "Li F" "Ding Z" "Liu H" "Zhu L" "Xu C" "Li J" "Gao Q" "Wang Y" "Fu Z" "Peng C" "Yan X" "Zhu X" "Cong Y."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021180118", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Distinct architecture and composition of mouse axonemal radial spoke head revealed by cryo-EM.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e2021180118", "volume" "118", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34871179}, "PUB00153060" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Zhang X" "Xiao Z" "Zhang J" "Xu C" "Liu S" "Cheng L" "Zhou S" "Zhao S" "Zhang Y" "Wu J" "Wang Y" "Liu M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111683", "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Differential requirements of IQUB for the assembly of radial spoke 1 and the motility of mouse cilia and flagella.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "111683", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36417862}, "PUB00155347" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhu L" "Liu H" "Chen Y" "Yan X" "Zhu X."], "ISO_journal" "Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/boc.201800060", "medline_journal" "Biol Cell", "title" "Rsph9 is critical for ciliary radial spoke assembly and central pair microtubule stability.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "29-38", "volume" "111", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30383886}, "PUB00092583" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Castleman VH" "Romio L" "Chodhari R" "Hirst RA" "de Castro SC" "Parker KA" "Ybot-Gonzalez P" "Emes RD" "Wilson SW" "Wallis C" "Johnson CA" "Herrera RJ" "Rutman A" "Dixon M" "Shoemark A" "Bush A" "Hogg C" "Gardiner RM" "Reish O" "Greene ND" "O'Callaghan C" "Purton S" "Chung EM" "Mitchison HM."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
