{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins of this family are predominantly nucleolar. Myb-binding protein 1A (MYBBP1A) is a transcription regulator that may play an important role in the cellular stress response [[cite:PUB00089664], [cite:PUB00089661], [cite:PUB00089663], [cite:PUB00099537]]. This family also includes the fifth essential DNA polymerase (Pol5p) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) ([ec:2.7.7.7]). Pol5p is localized exclusively to the nucleolus and binds near or at the enhancer region of rRNA-encoding DNA repeating units [[cite:PUB00019434]]. This protein was originally thought to be a DNA polymerase, however, later reseach indicated its involvement in ribosome assembly [[cite:PUB00089662], [cite:PUB00099538]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04931" "DNA polymerase phi"}, "panther" {"PTHR13213" "MYB-BINDING PROTEIN 1A FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase V/Myb-binding protein 1A", "short" "DNA_pol_V/MYBBP1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 67, "proteomes" 2368, "taxa" 8174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4587, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2305}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
