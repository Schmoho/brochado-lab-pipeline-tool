{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydropteroate synthase ([ec:2.5.1.15]) (DHPS), a functional homodimer, catalyses the condensation of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine pyrophosphate to para-aminobenzoic acid to form 7,8-dihydropteroate. This is the second step in the three-step pathway leading from 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin to 7,8-dihydrofolate. DHPS is the target of sulfonamides, which are substrate analogues that compete with para-aminobenzoic acid. Bacterial DHPS (gene sul or folP) [[cite:PUB00002127]] is a protein of about 275 to 315 amino acid residues that is either chromosomally encoded or found on various antibiotic resistance plasmids. In the lower eukaryote Pneumocystis carinii, DHPS is the C-terminal domain of a multifunctional folate synthesis enzyme (gene fas) [[cite:PUB00001816]].</p>\n\n<p>Prokaryotes (and some lower eukaryotes) must synthesize folate de novo, while higher eukaryotes are able to utilize dietary folate and therefore lack DHPS.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes the uncharacterised protein MJ0107 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii ([swissprot:Q57571]), which does not possess DHPS activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4pzv", "name" "Crystal structure of Francisella tularensis HPPK-DHPS in complex with bisubstrate analog HPPK inhibitor J1D"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011005", "name" "Dihydropteroate synthase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR20941" "FOLATE SYNTHESIS PROTEINS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihydropteroate synthase-like", "short" "DHP_synth-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 108, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10132, "taxa" 38005, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50986, "sets" 0, "proteins" 50986, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39078}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
