{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are about 200 amino acids in size, and include the uncharacterised YedF protein of Escherichia coli. This family shares an N-terminal domain, modelled by [interpro:IPR001455], with the sulphurtransferase TusA (also called SirA). The C-terminal domain includes a typical redox-active disulphide motif, CGXC. This protein family found only among those genomes that also carry the selenium donor protein SelD, and its connection to selenium metabolism is indicated by the method of partial phylogenetic profiling [[cite:PUB00034422]] vs. SelD. Its gene is typically found next to selD. Members of this family are found even when selenocysteine and selenouridine biosynthesis pathways are, except for SelD, completely absent, as in Enterococcus faecalis. Its role in selenium metabolism is unclear, but may include either detoxification or a role in labile selenoprotein biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03527" "sulfurtransferase-like selenium metabolism protein YedF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenium metabolism protein YedF", "short" "Se_metab_YedF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 757, "taxa" 3524, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3329, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3329, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2654}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0726", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0726"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019870", :literature {"PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
