{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins predominantly found in mammals, including human Negative regulator of P-body association, also called P-body dissociating protein or protein NoBody (non-annotated P-body dissociating polypeptide), a microprotein that interacts with mRNA decapping proteins, which remove the 5' cap from mRNAs to promote 5'-to-3' decay. It localises to P-bodies, which are mRNA-decay-associated RNA-protein granules. NoBody promotes dispersal of P-body components and is likely to play a role in the mRNA decapping process. Decapping proteins participate in mRNA turnover and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [[cite:PUB00107582]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21949" "Negative regulator of P-body association"}, "cdd" {"cd20243" "Negative regulator of P-body association"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Negative regulator of P-body association", "short" "NoBody"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 81, "taxa" 323, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 111, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 68}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047852", :literature {"PUB00107582" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["D'Lima NG" "Ma J" "Winkler L" "Chu Q" "Loh KH" "Corpuz EO" "Budnik BA" "Lykke-Andersen J" "Saghatelian A" "Slavoff SA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Chem Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Chem Biol", "title" "A human microprotein that interacts with the mRNA decapping complex.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "174-180", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27918561}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047852", "name" "Negative regulator of P-body association", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 85}}}
