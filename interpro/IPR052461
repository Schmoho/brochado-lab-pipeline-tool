{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the EVA1 A and B. EVA1A, also known as TMEM166, regulates cell autophagy and apoptosis, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress [[cite:PUB00089726], [cite:PUB00089727]]. EVA1A has also been shown to promote papillary thyroid cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via upregulating immune-related signaling pathways [[cite:PUB00155231]]. EVA1 play a pivotal role in these pathways, ensuring the proper execution of cell death mechanisms that are vital for organismal development and the prevention of disease.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48422" "PROTEIN EVA-1 HOMOLOG B-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EVA1 A/B", "short" "EVA1_A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 644, "taxa" 2229, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2067, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2067, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1415}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052461", :literature {"PUB00155231" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3-6", "authors" ["Izumi Y" "Isozumi K" "Fukuuchi Y."], "ISO_journal" "Tokai J Exp Clin Med", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Tokai J Exp Clin Med", "title" "Effect of sympathetic nervous system stimulation on cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "117-22", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7701523}, "PUB00089726" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Wang L" "Yu C" "Lu Y" "He P" "Guo J" "Zhang C" "Song Q" "Ma D" "Shi T" "Chen Y."], "ISO_journal" "Apoptosis", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10495-007-0073-9", "medline_journal" "Apoptosis", "title" "TMEM166, a novel transmembrane protein, regulates cell autophagy and apoptosis.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1489-502", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17492404}, "PUB00089727" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Hu J" "Li G" "Qu L" "Li N" "Liu W" "Xia D" "Hongdu B" "Lin X" "Xu C" "Lou Y" "He Q" "Ma D" "Chen Y."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Dis", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2016.230", "medline_journal" "Cell Death Dis", "title" "TMEM166/EVA1A interacts with ATG16L1 and induces autophagosome formation and cell death.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e2323", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27490928}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR052461", "name" "EVA1 A/B", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
