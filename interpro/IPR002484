{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arterivirus are ssRNA positive-strand viruses with no DNA stage in their replication cycle. This family contains the viral nucleocapsid protein, which encapsidates the viral ssRNA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of both severe and persistent respiratory disease and reproductive failure in pigs worldwide. The PRRSV virion contains a core made of the 123 amino acid nucleocapsid (N or VP1) protein, a product of the ORF7 gene. The crystal structure of the capsid-forming domain of the nucleocapsid protein has been determined to 2.6 A resolution.  The protein exists as a tight dimer forming a four-stranded β sheet floor superposed by two long α helices and flanked by two N- and two C-terminal α helices. The structure represents a new class of viral capsid-forming domains, distinctly different from those of other known enveloped viruses, but reminiscent of the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 [[cite:PUB00028004]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2i9f", "name" "Structure of the equine arterivirus nucleocapsid protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01481" "Arterivirus nucleocapsid protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arterivirus nucleocapsid", "short" "Arte_nucleocap"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1923, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1923, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002484", :literature {"PUB00028004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Doan DN" "Dokland T."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2003.09.018", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure of the nucleocapsid protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1445-51", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14604534}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019013", "name" "viral nucleocapsid", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002484", "name" "Arterivirus nucleocapsid", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 18}}}
