{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) is a DNA structure-specific nuclease involved in the processing of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). It maintains genomic stability and prevents tissue decline in several organs. This protein possesses preferential endonuclease activity toward 5' flap structures. FAN1 is present in most eukaryotes and some bacterial sequences. It consists of four characterised domains: UBZ, SAP, TPR and VRR nuclease ([interpro:IPR014883]). However, monocellular eukaryote and bacterial homologues lack the UBZ domain [[cite:PUB00078405]]. The N-terminal helical domain of FAN1 can be subdivided in a winged-helix (WH) DNA-binding domain, represented in this entry, and a SAP domain (bacterial [interpro:IPR040603] and eukaryotic [pfam:PF21169]) [[cite:PUB00078405], [cite:PUB00151715], [cite:PUB00103838], [cite:PUB00152132], [cite:PUB00103839]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd22326" "repair nuclease FAN1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fanconi-associated nuclease 1-like, eukaryotes", "short" "FAN1-like_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2195, "taxa" 7167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3700, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3700, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2271}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
