{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Phosphomevalonate decarboxylase from Haloferax volcanii (MvaD) and similar enzymes responsible for the decarboxylation of mevalonate monophosphate from halophilic archaea.

It functions in an alternate mevalonate (MVA) pathway leading to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), a key precursor for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds such as archaeal membrane lipids [[cite:PUB00069710]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014721", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5 domain 2-type fold, subgroup", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040704" "archaeal-type phosphomevalonate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphomevalonate decarboxylase", "short" "MvaD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 578, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 425, "sets" 0, "proteins" 425, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 374}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
