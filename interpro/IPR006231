{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The membrane-associated enzyme, malate:quinone-oxidoreductase, is an alternative to the better-known NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase as part of the TCA cycle. The reduction of a quinone rather than NAD+ makes the reaction essentially irreversible in the direction of malate oxidation to oxaloacetate. Both forms of malate dehydrogenase are active in Escherichia coli; disruption of this form causes less phenotypic change. In some bacteria, this form is the only or the more important malate dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00009577]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00212" "Probable malate:quinone oxidoreductase [mqo]"}, "pfam" {"PF06039" "Malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01320" "malate dehydrogenase (quinone)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Malate:quinone-oxidoreductase", "short" "MQO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 2430, "taxa" 9940, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12034, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12031, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9468}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
