{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of related animal transcription factors, including NFE2 and NFE2-like proteins, such as NFE2-like 1 (also known as NFE2-related factor 1, NFE2L1/Nrf1), NFE2L2 and NFE2L3 (or Nrf3). This family also includes the orthologue CNC from Drosophila, which regulates the activation of genes by oxidative stress and SKN-1 from C. elegans [[cite:PUB00102083]]. These are Cap'n'Collar (CNC) Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors that are defined by a conserved 43-amino acid region (called the CNC domain) located N-terminal to the bZIP DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00071161], [cite:PUB00102082], [cite:PUB00102081]].</p>\n\n<p>NFE2 functions in development; it is required for the proper development of platelets. As part of the NF-E2 complex, it is essential for regulating erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation and differentiation. The three Nrfs function in stress responses. Nrf1 is an essential protein that binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and is also involved in regulating oxidative stress. In addition, it also regulates genes involved in cell and tissue differentiation, inflammation, and hepatocyte homeostasis. Nrf3 has been linked to differentiation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis [[cite:PUB00071161]].</p>\n\n<p>Nrf2, the most extensively studied member of this subfamily, acts as a xenobiotic-activated receptor that regulates the adaptive response to oxidants and electrophiles [[cite:PUB00102082], [cite:PUB00102081]]. As the master regulator of the antioxidant defense pathway, it plays roles in the biology of inflammation, obesity, and cancer. Mammalian Nrf2 was shown to be protective during infections as diverse as septic shock, pneumonia, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and periodontitis [[cite:PUB00102083]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24411" "NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID 2-RELATED FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear Factor Erythroid-derived 2-like", "short" "NFE2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 934, "taxa" 3965, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5436, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5436, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3585}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047167", :literature {"PUB00102082" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Huppke P" "Weissbach S" "Church JA" "Schnur R" "Krusen M" "Dreha-Kulaczewski S" "Kuhn-Velten WN" "Wolf A" "Huppke B" "Millan F" "Begtrup A" "Almusafri F" "Thiele H" "Altmuller J" "Nurnberg P" "Muller M" "Gartner J."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Activating de novo mutations in NFE2L2 encoding NRF2 cause a multisystem disorder.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "818", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29018201}, "PUB00102081" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sanghvi VR" "Leibold J" "Mina M" "Mohan P" "Berishaj M" "Li Z" "Miele MM" "Lailler N" "Zhao C" "de Stanchina E" "Viale A" "Akkari L" "Lowe SW" "Ciriello G" "Hendrickson RC" "Wendel HG."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "The Oncogenic Action of NRF2 Depends on De-glycation by Fructosamine-3-Kinase.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "807-819.e21", "volume" "178", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31398338}, "PUB00071161" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Chevillard G" "Blank V."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
