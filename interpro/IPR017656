{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of genes are members of the [interpro:IPR015590] NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase family. These genes are observed in Ralstonia eutropha (strain JMP134) (Alcaligenes eutrophus), Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344, Burkholderia thailandensis (strain E264/ATCC 700388/DSM 13276/CIP 106301), Burkholderia cenocepacia (strain AU 1054), Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243 and Burkholderia pseudomallei (strain 1710b), Burkholderia xenovorans (strain LB400), Burkholderia sp. (strain 383) (Burkholderia cepacia (strain ATCC 17760/NCIB 9086/R18194)) and Polaromonas sp. (strain JS666/ATCC BAA-500) in close proximity to the PhnW gene ([interpro:IPR012703]) encoding 2-aminoethyl phosphonate aminotransferase (which generates phosphonoacetaldehyde) and PhnA ([interpro:IPR012710]) encoding phosphonoacetate hydrolase (not to be confused with the alkylphosphonate utilization operon protein PhnA modelled by [interpro:IPR004624]). Additionally, transporters believed to be specific for 2-aminoethyl phosphonate are often present. PhnW is, in other organisms, coupled with PhnX ([interpro:IPR006323]) for the degradation of phosphonoacetaldehyde ([genprop:GenProp0238]), but PhnX is apparently absent in each of the organisms containing this aldehyde reductase. PhnA, characterised in a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens that has not yet had its genome sequenced, is only rarely found outside of the PhnW and aldehyde dehydrogenase context. For instance in Rhodopseudomonas and Bordetella bronchiseptica, where it is adjacent to transporters presumably specific for the import of phosphonoacetate. It seems reasonably certain then, that this enzyme catalyses the NAD-dependent oxidation of phosphonoacetaldehyde to phosphonoacetate, bridging the metabolic gap between PhnW and PhnA. We propose the name phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase and the gene symbol PhnY for this enzyme. The structure of PhnY has been solved [[cite:PUB00091684]].</p>\n\n<p>Putative phosphonoformaldehyde dehydrogenase (PhpJ), an aldehyde dehydrogenase homologue reportedly involved in the biosynthesis of phosphinothricin tripeptides in Streptomyces viridochromogenes DSM 40736, is also included in this entry [[cite:PUB00081180]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4i3v", "name" "Structure of phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase in complex with phosphonoacetaldehyde and cofactor NAD+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07146" "Streptomyces putative phosphonoformaldehyde dehydrogenase PhpJ-like"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03250" "phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase", "short" "Put_phosphonoacetaldehyde_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 236, "taxa" 1277, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1412, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1412, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1071}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0724", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0724"} {"accession" "GenProp0713", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0713"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
