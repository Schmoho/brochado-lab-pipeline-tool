{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins specific to Drosophila species, including Hemotin from Drosophila melanogaster. Hemotin is a transmembrane Î±-helical microprotein localised to early endosomes in hemocytes (Drosophila macrophages), where it regulates endosomal maturation during phagocytosis by repressing the cooperation of 14-3-3zeta with specific phosphatidylinositol enzymes. Hemocytes are professional phagocytes tasked with removing dying cells and microorganisms invading the body. Drosophila hemotin mutants accumulate undigested phagocytic material inside enlarged endolysosomes, resulting in reduced ability to fight bacteria and severely reduced life span [[cite:PUB00107189]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21944" "Hemotin"}, "cdd" {"cd20249" "Hemotin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hemotin", "short" "Hemotin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 52, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047851", :literature {"PUB00107189" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Pueyo JI" "Magny EG" "Sampson CJ" "Amin U" "Evans IR" "Bishop SA" "Couso JP."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Hemotin, a Regulator of Phagocytosis Encoded by a Small ORF and Conserved across Metazoans.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1002395", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27015288}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047851", "name" "Hemotin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 5}}}
