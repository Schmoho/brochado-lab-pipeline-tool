{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Urease is a nickel-dependent metalloenzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. Nickel-dependent ureases are found in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants. Their primary role is to allow the use of external and internally-generated urea as a nitrogen source. The enzyme consists of three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which can exist as separate proteins or can be fused on a single protein chain. The α-β-γ heterotrimer forms multimers, mainly trimers. The large alpha subunit is the catalytic domain containing an active site with a bi-nickel centre complexed by a carbamylated lysine. The beta and gamma subunits play a role in subunit association to form the higher order trimers [[cite:PUB00079461], [cite:PUB00018934], [cite:PUB00079462], [cite:PUB00018936], [cite:PUB00010725]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the urease beta subunit and similar sequences mainly found in bacteria and fungi.
