{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs) and closely related sequences which are members of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR)/zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-like family and contain two domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann fold domain and an N-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to GroES. CADs reduce cinnamaldehydes to cinnamyl alcohols in the last step of monolignal metabolism in plant cells walls in a NADPH dependent manner and bind two zinc ions [[cite:PUB00039995], [cite:PUB00101960], [cite:PUB00101962]]. This family also includes geissoschizine synthase from Madagascar periwinkle, a protein involved in monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) biosynthesis pathway. MIAs, such as catharanthine, tabersonine, vincadifformine, vindoline or vincristine, are important anticancer drugs [[cite:PUB00101961]]. CAD family members are also found in non-plant species [[cite:PUB00081596]], such as ADH6/ADH7 from yeast where they have an aldehyde reductase activity and may be involved in fusel alcohol synthesis or in aldehyde tolerance, and YahK/YjgB from bacteria [[cite:PUB00101959]]. ADH-like proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7bu3", "name" "Structure of alcohol dehydrogenase YjgB in complex with NADP from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05283" "Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CAD)"}, "panther" {"PTHR42683" "ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase-like", "short" "CAD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4858, "taxa" 19267, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33734, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33612, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23545}, "pathways" 185}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
