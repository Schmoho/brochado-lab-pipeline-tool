{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription elongation Spt5 proteins. These proteins contain two copies of a domain (Supt5; [interpro:IPR005100]) that is characteristic of proteins involved in chromatin regulation. An NGN domain separates the Supt5 domains. In yeast Spt5 protein, this domain possesses a RNP-like fold and it is thought to confer affinity for Spt4 protein. Supt5 domains are followed by four to five copies of a KOW domain ([interpro:IPR005824]), present in many ribosomal proteins.</p>\n\n<p>Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription via modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association Spt6 is considerably weaker. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans, including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles [[cite:PUB00012261]].</p>\n\n<p>This information was partially derived from InterPro ([interpro:IPR009287]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036945" "Transcription elongation factor Spt5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription elongation factor Spt5, eukaryote", "short" "TF_Spt5_eukaryote"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 47, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1943, "taxa" 6884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4808, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3852, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2368}, "pathways" 55}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017071", :literature {"PUB00012261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Winston F."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11182892", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "Control of eukaryotic transcription elongation.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS1006", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11182892}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006357", "name" "regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0032784", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription elongation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039659", "name" "Transcription elongation factor SPT5", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017071", "name" "Transcription elongation factor Spt5, eukaryote", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
