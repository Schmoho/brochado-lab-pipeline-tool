{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Faithful chromosome segregation depends on the opposing activities of the budding yeast Glc7/PP1 protein phosphatase and Ipl1/Aurora protein kinase. It is believed that Glc7 ensures accurate chromosome segregation by dephosphorylating Ipl1 targets (rather than regulating the Ipl1 kinase) [[cite:PUB00060265]].</p>\r\n<p>Gip3 and Gip4 have been identified amongst several genes as ipl1 dosage suppressors, and encode proteins that physically interact with Glc7 [[cite:PUB00060265]]. Over-expression of the GIP3 and GIP4 suppressors was shown to alter Glc7 localisation, indicating they are previously unidentified Glc7 regulatory subunits, and that Gip3 and Gip4 over-expression may impair Glc7's mitotic functions. It has been proposed, therefore, that over- expression of Glc7 regulatory subunits can titrate Glc7 away from relevant Ipl1 targets, thereby suppressing ipl1-321 cells by restoring the balance of phosphatase/kinase activity [[cite:PUB00060265]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02082" "GLC7-interacting protein 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GLC7-interacting protein 4", "short" "GIP4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 55, "taxa" 199, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 564, "sets" 0, "proteins" 107, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 86}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026241", :literature {"PUB00060265" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Pinsky BA" "Kotwaliwale CV" "Tatsutani SY" "Breed CA" "Biggins S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
