{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins are about 50 to 77kDa. The central region is well conserved and contains three conserved histidines. Most of these proteins are related at the N-terminal region to the beta-lactamase family. The family has been characterised as ribonuclease J. RNase J cleaves the 5'-leader sequence of certain mRNAs and may play a role in the maturation and stability of specific mRNAs [[cite:PUB00074172]]. It is also required for the maturation of the 16S rRNA acting preferentially on 16S rRNA precursors after association of the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits [[cite:PUB00074173], [cite:PUB00074174]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xww", "name" "Crystal structure of RNase J complexed with RNA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00649" "RNase J family beta-CASP ribonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease J", "short" "RNase_J"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4770, "taxa" 19520, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19772}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
