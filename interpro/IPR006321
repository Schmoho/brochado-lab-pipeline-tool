{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial type IV pili are critical surface appendages involved in diverse biological processes including horizontal gene transfer, surface and host cell adhesion, biofilm formation, colonization, twitching and virulence. These pili extend and retract from the cell surface, requiring the action of an extension ATPase, often called PilB, and a retraction ATPase PilT, respectively [[cite:PUB00007956]]. PilT depolymerizes the pilus fibre and recycles pilin subunits into the inner membrane. Many type IVa pilus systems also have a homologue of the retraction ATPase PilT, called PilU, which promotes type IV pilus retraction in a PilT-dependent manner through its ATPase activity. PilT and PilU are required for twitching motility and form independent homo-hexamers, which directly interact. PilU is important for generating maximal retraction forces [[cite:PUB00094573], [cite:PUB00094574]]. Members of this family may be found in some species that do not have type IV pili but have related structures for DNA uptake and natural transformation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2eyu", "name" "The Crystal Structure of the C-terminal Domain of Aquifex aeolicus PilT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01131" "Pilus retraction ATPase PilT"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01420" "PilT/PilU family type 4a pilus ATPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pilus retraction protein PilT/PilU", "short" "PilT/PilU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3556, "taxa" 17837, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41000, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40951, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31092}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006321", :literature {"PUB00007956" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6800", "authors" ["Merz AJ" "So M" "Sheetz MP."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35024105", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Pilus retraction powers bacterial twitching motility.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "98-102", "volume" "407", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10993081}, "PUB00094573" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Chlebek JL" "Hughes HQ" "Ratkiewicz AS" "Rayyan R" "Wang JC" "Herrin BE" "Dalia TN" "Biais N" "Dalia AB."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "PilT and PilU are homohexameric ATPases that coordinate to retract type IVa pili.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "e1008448", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31626631}, "PUB00094574" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Shikata M" "Hayashi N" "Fujimoto A" "Nakamura T" "Matsui N" "Ishiyama A" "Maekawa Y" "Gotoh N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
