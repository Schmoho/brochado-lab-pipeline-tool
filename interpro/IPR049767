{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the RppA family as it is found in Synechocystis sp. ([swissprot:Q55933]) and related cyanobacterial species. RppA is member of two-component regulatory system RppA/RppB, involved in the establishment of the appropriate stoichiometry between the 2 photosystems. It senses changes in the plastoquinone (PQ) redox poise [[cite:PUB00152879]].</p>\n\n<p>It has also been reported that the RppA/RppB two-component pair (also known as NrsR/NrsS) regulates the nickel-dependent expression of the nrsBACD operon [[cite:PUB00152878]]. It has been suggested that the photosystem-related activities are a result of the expression of NrsS (formerly RppB) in the absence of its natural substrate NrsR (formerly RppA) [[cite:PUB00152878]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041734" "two-component system response regulator RppA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Two-component system response regulator RppA", "short" "RppA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 171, "taxa" 1136, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1367, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1367, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 925}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049767", :literature {"PUB00152878" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lopez-Maury L" "Garcia-Dominguez M" "Florencio FJ" "Reyes JC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02741.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "A two-component signal transduction system involved in nickel sensing in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
