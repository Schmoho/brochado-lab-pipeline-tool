The structure of a LMW PTPase has been solved by X-ray crystallography [[cite:PUB00004186]] and is found to form a single structural domain.

Consequently, maintaining an appropriate level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for many cellular functions. Tyrosine-specific protein phosphatases (PTPase; [ec:3.1.3.48]) catalyse the removal of a phosphate group attached to a tyrosine residue, using a cysteinyl-phosphate enzyme intermediate. These enzymes are key regulatory components in signal transduction pathways (such as the MAP kinase pathway) and cell cycle control, and are important in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and transformation [[cite:PUB00035793], [cite:PUB00035794]].
