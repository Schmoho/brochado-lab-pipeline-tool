{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial GreA [interpro:IPR006359] and GreB promote transcription elongation by stimulating an endogenous, endonucleolytic transcript cleavage activity of the RNA polymerase, allowing RNA transcription to continue past template-encoded arresting sites. GreA and GreB are sequence homologues and have homologues in every known bacterial genome. GreA and GreB stimulate transcript cleavage in different ways; GreA induces cleavage of 3'-RNA fragments 2-3 nt in length and can only prevent the formation of arrested complexes, whereas GreB induces cleavage of fragments up to 18 nt in length and can rescue preexisting arrested complexes [[cite:PUB00011909]].</p>\n\n<p>A 15 Angstrom resolution helical reconstruction of the Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase (RNAP)/GreB complex that allows fitting of high-resolution RNAP and GreB structures. The model of the complex reveals a remarkable binding mode for GreB; the globular C-terminal domain binds RNAP at the edge of the active site channel, while the N-terminal coiled-coil domain extends 45 Angstrom into a channel directly to the RNAP active site. The results point to a key role for conserved acidic residues at the tip of the Gre factor coiled coil in modifying the RNAP active site to catalyse the transcript cleavage reaction, and mutational studies confirm that these positions are critical for Gre factor function. Functional differences between GreA and GreB correlate with the distribution of positively charged residues on one face of the N-terminal coiled coil.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036953", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA/GreB, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00930" "Transcription elongation factor GreB [greB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01461" "transcription elongation factor GreB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription elongation factor GreB", "short" "Tscrpt_elong_fac_GreB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2060, "taxa" 8861, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9342, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7230}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006358", :literature {"PUB00011909" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Opalka N" "Chlenov M" "Chacon P" "Rice WJ" "Wriggers W" "Darst SA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00600-7", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure and function of the transcription elongation factor GreB bound to bacterial RNA polymerase.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "335-45", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12914698}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0032784", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription elongation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023459", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA/GreB family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR028624", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA/GreB", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006358", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006359", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR028625", "name" "Regulator of nucleoside diphosphate kinase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
