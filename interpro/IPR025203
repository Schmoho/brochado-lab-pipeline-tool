{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of short 14kDa proteins from Psuedomonas. The structure of [swissprot:Q9HY15]  a secreted protein has been solved and deposited as PDB:3npd.  It comprises one structural domain with five β-strands and five α-helices. Various comparative structural prediction methods plus its genomic location point to the protein forming a functional dimer with its adjacent genomic partner, [swissprot:Q9HY14]. Together these might be regulated by the other product from the PotABCD operon, namely the putrescine-binding periplasmic protein [swissprot:Q9HY16]. which has been implicated in quorum-sensing. QSregVF is certainly up-regulated in quorum-sensing, and is predicted to be a virulence factor [[cite:PUB00075641]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3npd", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative secreted protein (PA3611) from PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA at 1.60 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13652" "Putative quorum-sensing-regulated virulence factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative quorum-sensing-regulated virulence factor, QSregVF", "short" "QSregVF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 72, "taxa" 778, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 946, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 768}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025203", :literature {"PUB00075641" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Das D" "Chiu HJ" "Farr CL" "Grant JC" "Jaroszewski L" "Knuth MW" "Miller MD" "Tien HJ" "Elsliger MA" "Deacon AM" "Godzik A" "Lesley SA" "Wilson IA."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.24455", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of a putative quorum sensing-regulated protein (PA3611) from the Pseudomonas-specific DUF4146 family.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1086-92", "volume" "82", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24174223}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025203", "name" "Putative quorum-sensing-regulated virulence factor, QSregVF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 71}}}
