{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents SPAN-X (Sperm Protein Associated with the Nucleus on the X chromosome) family proteins, including N1, N2, N3 and N5. These human sperm proteins are associated with the nucleus and mapped to the X chromosome (SPAN-X) (approximately 100 residues long). SPAN-X proteins are cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), and thus represent potential targets for cancer immunotherapy because they are widely distributed in tumours but not in normal tissues, except testes. They are highly insoluble, acidic, and polymorphic [[cite:PUB00013163]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07458" "Sperm protein associated with nucleus, mapped to X chromosome"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPAN-X family", "short" "SPAN-X_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 172, "sets" 0, "proteins" 172, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 146}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010007", :literature {"PUB00013163" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Westbrook VA" "Diekman AB" "Naaby-Hansen S" "Coonrod SA" "Klotz KL" "Thomas TS" "Norton EJ" "Flickinger CJ" "Herr JC."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
