{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes transposases of Tn3, Tn21, Tn1721, Tn2501, Tn3926 transposons from Escherichia coli and similar bacterial sequences. The specific binding of the Tn3 transposase to DNA has been demonstrated. Sequence analysis has suggested that the invariant triad of Asp689, Asp765, Glu895 (numbering as in Tn3) may correspond to the D-D-35-E motif previously implicated in the catalytic performance of numerous transposases [[cite:PUB00000555]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033527" "Tn3 family transposase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tn3-like transposase", "short" "Tn3-like_transpos"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 896, "taxa" 5543, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9214, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7100}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047653", :literature {"PUB00000555" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yurieva O" "Nikiforov V."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
