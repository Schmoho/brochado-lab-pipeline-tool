{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Bradykinin sequences. The skins of anuran amphibians, in addition to mucus glands, contain highly specialised poison glands, which, in reaction to stress or attack, exude a complex noxious cocktail of biologically active molecules. These secretions often contain a plethora of peptides among which Bradykinin or structural variants have been identified [[cite:PUB00012821]]. Bradykinin, widespread among frogs, is able to pass through epithelial barriers independently and interfere in multiple physiological processes without the need of other substances to enhance the uptake [[cite:PUB00099770]]. The diversity of bioactive peptides found in the skin secretions of amphibian species great potential for drug discovery and biotechnological applications [[cite:PUB00099771]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06753" "Bradykinin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bradykinin", "short" "Bradykinin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 73, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009608", :literature {"PUB00012821" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Chen T" "Orr DF" "Bjourson AJ" "McClean S" "O'Rourke M" "Hirst DG" "Rao P" "Shaw C."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
