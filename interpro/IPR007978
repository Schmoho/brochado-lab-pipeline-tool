{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several baculovirus occlusion-derived virus envelope proteins (EC27 or E27) which appear to act as a multifuntional cyclins during the host cell cycle. The ODV-E27 protein has distinct functional characteristics compared to cellular and viral cyclins. When associated with cdc2, it exhibits cyclin B-like activity; when associated with cdk6, the complex possesses cyclin D-like activity and binds PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) [[cite:PUB00010479]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05314" "Baculovirus occlusion-derived virus envelope protein EC27"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baculovirus occlusion-derived virus envelope EC27", "short" "Baculo_ODV-E27"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 223, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 148, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007978", :literature {"PUB00010479" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Belyavskyi M" "Braunagel SC" "Summers MD."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
