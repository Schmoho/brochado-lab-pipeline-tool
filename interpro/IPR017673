The high trusted cut-off score for this model, 700 bits, excludes homologues from other lineages. This exclusion seems justified because a significant number of sequence positions are simultaneously unique to and invariant across the Cyanobacteria, suggesting a specialised, conserved function, perhaps related to photosynthesis.
