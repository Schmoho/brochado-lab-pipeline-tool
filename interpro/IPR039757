{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry contain at least an N-terminal PUA (PseudoUridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase)  domain and a C-terminal SUI1 domain.  Proteins with this architecture include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D (EIF2D; formerly and erroneously known as ligatin): a factor that initiates translation by delivering tRNA to the P-site, where the initiating AUG codon binds, of the eukaryotic ribosome in a GTP-independent manner [[cite:PUB00090065]].  EIF2D recruits aminoacylated initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(Met)(i)) to 40S/mRNA complexes and promotes release of deacylated tRNA and mRNA from recycled 40S subunits after ABCE1-mediated dissociation of post-termination ribosomes [[cite:PUB00090066]].</li>\r\n<li>Translation machinery-associated protein 64 (Tma64) from the yeast<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, which is uncharacterized but also interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00035474]].</li>\r\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5w2f", "name" "Crystal Structure of the C-terminal Domain of Human eIF2D at 1.4 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12217" "EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D", "short" "EIF2D"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2258, "taxa" 7926, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4576, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4576, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2982}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039757", :literature {"PUB00090065" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Dmitriev SE" "Terenin IM" "Andreev DE" "Ivanov PA" "Dunaevsky JE" "Merrick WC" "Shatsky IN."], "ISO_journal" "J.
