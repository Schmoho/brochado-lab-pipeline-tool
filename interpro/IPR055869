{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a highly conserved domain found in various bacteriophages, particularly those infecting Salmonella and related bacteria. The domain is also present in some bacterial species, suggesting possible horizontal gene transfer. The function is unknown, but the high degree of conservation implies an important role in phage biology. A conserved motif DVT is present centrally in many family members. The aspartate and threonine form side chain hydrogen bonds that help stabilise the dimeric interaction.  Structure prediction suggests these proteins form a confident homodimer (iPTM=0.83).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24233" "Family of unknown function (DUF7446)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7446", "short" "DUF7446"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 827, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 596, "sets" 0, "proteins" 596, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 294}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055869", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055869", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7446", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 79}}}
