{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the human CD59 glycoprotein and related proteins. CD59 is a cell-surface glycoprotein that protects host cells from complement-mediated lysis. It binds to and prevents the normal functioning of the complement proteins C8 and C9 which form part of a membrane penetrating assembly called the membrane attack complex. CD59 folds into a compact domain with a central three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet located on one side of it. This structure is stabilised by disulphide bonds and has a significant similarity to the snake venom neurotoxins and other members of the uPAR/Ly6/CD59/snake toxin-receptor superfamily [[cite:PUB00023914]]. CD59 binds the pore-forming β-hairpins of C8 to form an intermolecular β-sheet that prevents membrane perforation. While bound to C8, CD59 deflects the cascading C9 β-hairpins, rerouting their trajectory into the membrane [[cite:PUB00159887]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ux2", "name" "High resolution structure of human CD59"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045860", "name" "Snake toxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF25152" "CD59 glycoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CD59 glycoprotein", "short" "CD59"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 612, "taxa" 2248, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1579, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1575, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1052}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056949", :literature {"PUB00023914" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Fletcher CM" "Harrison RA" "Lachmann PJ" "Neuhaus D."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00020-4", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure of a soluble, glycosylated form of the human complement regulatory protein CD59.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "185-99", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7520819}, "PUB00159887" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Couves EC" "Gardner S" "Voisin TB" "Bickel JK" "Stansfeld PJ" "Tate EW" "Bubeck D."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36441-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structural basis for membrane attack complex inhibition by CD59.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "890", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36797260}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056949", "name" "CD59 glycoprotein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 1051}}}
