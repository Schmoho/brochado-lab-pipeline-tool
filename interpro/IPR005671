This pathway operates in archaea, bacteria, fungi and plants, but not mammals, making the enzymes suitable targets for the development of novel antibiotics and herbicides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isopropylmalate synthase is the enzyme responsible for the the first committed step in the leucine branch of this biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of alpha-ketoisovalerate to alpha-isopropylmalate. It is either dimeric or tetrameric, depending on the organism, with a monomer molecular mass of 60-70kDa, a dependence on divalent metal ions for activity, and an alkaline pH optimum [[cite:PUB00034700], [cite:PUB00034701], [cite:PUB00034702], [cite:PUB00020847]].
