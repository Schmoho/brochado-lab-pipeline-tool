{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of archaeal proteins, including RNA-binding protein PAB1135 from Pyrococcus abyssi, UPF0201 protein PH1010 from Pyrococcus horikoshii and UPF0201 protein SSO1042 from Saccharolobus solfataricus. While PAB1135 has been reported to bind efficiently double-stranded RNAs in vitro in a non-sequence specific manner [[cite:PUB00066786]], other members of this family such as PH1010  are unlike to have rRNA-binding ability despite its structural similarity to the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein as the residues involved in RNA-binding in the L5 protein are not conserved in members of this family [[cite:PUB00048377], [cite:PUB00051274]].</p>\n\n<p>PH1010 is composed of six β-strands that form a slightly twisted antiparallel β-sheet and face five α-helices on one side and two additional β-strands forming an antiparallel β-sheet in the C terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal. Dimerisation of the molecule is crucial for function [[cite:PUB00051274]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3d7a", "name" "Crystal structure of DUF54 family protein PH1010 from hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR022803", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein uL5 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39652" "UPF0201 PROTEIN TK1335"}, "hamap" {"MF_01112" "UPF0201 protein <locus_tag>"}, "pfam" {"PF01877" "RNA binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding protein PAB1135-like", "short" "PAB1135-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 278, "taxa" 2026, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4512, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4511, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3899}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002739", :literature {"PUB00051274" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Miyazono K" "Shirokane M" "Sawano Y" "Tanokura M."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.22255", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of the DUF54 family protein PH1010 from hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "256-60", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18831045}, "PUB00048377" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Rao KN" "Burley SK" "Swaminathan S."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003903", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "UPF201 archaeal specific family members reveal structural similarity to RNA-binding proteins but low likelihood for RNA-binding function.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "e3903", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19079550}, "PUB00066786" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Luz JS" "Barbosa JA" "Ramos CR" "Oliveira CC."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Res Notes", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-97", "medline_journal" "BMC Res Notes", "title" "Expression, purification and structural analysis of the Pyrococcus abyssi RNA binding protein PAB1135.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "97", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20380716}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002739", "name" "RNA-binding protein PAB1135-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 82, "alignment:full" 530}}}
