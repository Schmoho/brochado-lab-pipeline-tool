{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phloem protein 2 (PP2) is one of the most abundant and enigmatic proteins in the phloem sap. PP2 is translocated in the assimilate stream where its lectin activity or RNA-binding properties can exert effects over long distances. PP2-like genes have been identified in many plant species, indicating a wide distribution of PP2 genes in the plant kingdom [[cite:PUB00058182]].</p>\n\n<p>Phloem Protein2-Like A1 and Phloem Protein2-Like A2 are presumed to have roles in phloem function, although their specific functions remain uncharacterised. Some members of the family, like PP2-Like A5, contain a TIR domain which is implicated in NAD(+) hydrolase activity and is essential for self-association required for this activity [[cite:PUB00155266]].</p>\n\n<p>Phloem lectins bind chito-oligosaccharides and may have hemagglutinating activity or be involved in plant defense by binding to the chitin cell wall of pathogens [[cite:PUB00155265]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7vub", "name" "Phloem lectin (PP2) complex with Nitrobenzene"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48478" "LECTIN-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phloem protein 2-like/Lectin", "short" "PP2-like/Lectin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 879, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1499, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1499, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 884}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
