{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family incudes Protein YecM from Escherichia coli and similar proteins predominantly found in gammaproteobacteria. YecM shows a pseudo-twofold axis with eight β-strands forming a curved sheet that wraps around C-terminal α-helix and a presumed active site, forming a deep groove, and two α-helices on each side of the sheet. It may be a metal-binding protein and function as an enzyme, but its specific function is still unknown [[cite:PUB00021075]].
