{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). This BGC (BGC0001435) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic classes, polyketide and NRP (non-ribosomal peptide). It includes a member from the ikarugamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. ZJ306 and appears to be predominantly found in Actinobacteria [[cite:PUB00099375], [cite:PUB00099373]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19650" "Family of unknown function (DUF6153)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6153", "short" "DUF6153"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 493, "taxa" 1512, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1528, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1149}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046151", :literature {"PUB00099375" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Antosch J" "Schaefers F" "Gulder TA."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "Heterologous reconstitution of ikarugamycin biosynthesis in E.â€…coli.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "3011-4", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24519911}, "PUB00099373" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Zhang G" "Zhang W" "Zhang Q" "Shi T" "Ma L" "Zhu Y" "Li S" "Zhang H" "Zhao YL" "Shi R" "Zhang C."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "Mechanistic insights into polycycle formation by reductive cyclization in ikarugamycin biosynthesis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "4840-4", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24706593}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046151", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6153", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 84, "alignment:full" 580}}}
