{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 4 (UQCC4) from vertebrates, a family of proteins that was discovered in a screen of Bos taurus placental ESTs. The B. taurus member of this family was named cattle cerebrum and skeletal muscle-specific transcript 1 (CCSMST1) [[cite:PUB00054093]], hence the alternative name of the family. UQCC4 is required for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III (CIII) or cytochrome b-c1 complex), a multisubunit transmembrane complex that is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) which drives oxidative phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00103608]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02042" "Cattle cerebrum and skeletal muscle-specific protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 4, vertebrates", "short" "UQCC4_vert"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 268, "taxa" 1159, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1507, "sets" 0, "proteins" 381, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 218}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023248", :literature {"PUB00103608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Liang C" "Zhang S" "Robinson D" "Ploeg MV" "Wilson R" "Nah J" "Taylor D" "Beh S" "Lim R" "Sun L" "Muoio DM" "Stroud DA" "Ho L."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Mitochondrial microproteins link metabolic cues to respiratory chain biogenesis.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "111204", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35977508}, "PUB00054093" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Larson JH" "Kumar CG" "Everts RE" "Green CA" "Everts-van der Wind A" "Band MR" "Lewin HA."], "ISO_journal" "Physiol.
