{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT, also known as 2-hydroxymuconate tautomerase) from bacteria and some archaeal species. It is an enzyme that converts 2-hydroxymuconate to the α-β-unsaturated ketone, 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate [[cite:PUB00066780]]. This enzyme forms part of a bacterial metabolic pathway that oxidatively catabolizes toluene, o-xylene, 3-ethyltoluene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene into intermediates of the citric acid cycle. With a monomer size of just 62 amino acid residues, the 4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase is one of the smallest enzyme subunits known [[cite:PUB00007676]].  However, in solution, the enzyme forms a hexamer of six identical subunits, so the active site may be formed by amino acid residues from several subunits [[cite:PUB00019310]].  This enzyme is also unusual in that it uses a proline residue at the amino terminus as an active site residue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6bgn", "name" "Crystal Structure of 4-Oxalocrotonate Tautomerase After Incubation with 5-Fluoro-2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014347", "name" "Tautomerase/MIF superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00491" "4Oxalocrotonate_Tautomerase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00013" "2-hydroxymuconate tautomerase family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase", "short" "4-OT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1571, "taxa" 8022, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7549, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7548, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6125}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0708", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0708"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
