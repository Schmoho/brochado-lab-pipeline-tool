{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Peptidoglycan endopeptidase RipA found exclusively in Mycobacteriales. RipA is a peptidoglycan endopeptidase that cleaves the bond between D-glutamate and meso-diaminopimelate [[cite:PUB00105292]]. It binds and degrades high-molecular weight peptidoglycan from a number of Actinobacteria and its activity is increased in the presence of RpfB and inhibited by PBP1A (ponA1). RipA is required for normal separation of daughter cells after cell division and for cell wall integrity. RipA is also required for host cell invasion and intracellular survival in host macrophages [[cite:PUB00105292], [cite:PUB00105293], [cite:PUB00153129]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4q4g", "name" "Structure of the Resuscitation Promoting Factor Interacting protein RipA mutated at C383"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033741" "NlpC/P60 family peptidoglycan endopeptidase RipA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidoglycan endopeptidase RipA", "short" "RipA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 415, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 347}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049836", :literature {"PUB00105292" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Martinelli DJ" "Pavelka MS Jr."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "The RipA and RipB Peptidoglycan Endopeptidases Are Individually Nonessential to Mycobacterium smegmatis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1464-75", "volume" "198", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26977111}, "PUB00105293" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Steiner EM" "Lyngso J" "Guy JE" "Bourenkov G" "Lindqvist Y" "Schneider TR" "Pedersen JS" "Schneider G" "Schnell R."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "The structure of the N-terminal module of the cell wall hydrolase RipA and its role in regulating catalytic activity.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "912-923", "volume" "86", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29722065}, "PUB00153129" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Ruggiero A" "Marasco D" "Squeglia F" "Soldini S" "Pedone E" "Pedone C" "Berisio R."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2010.06.007", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure and functional regulation of RipA, a mycobacterial enzyme essential for daughter cell separation.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1184-90", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20826344}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049836", "name" "Peptidoglycan endopeptidase RipA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
