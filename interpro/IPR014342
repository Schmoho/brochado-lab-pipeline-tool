{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energise diverse biological systems. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs.</p>\n\n<p>ABC transporters are involved in the export or import of a wide variety of substrates ranging from small ions to macromolecules. The major function of ABC import systems is to provide essential nutrients to bacteria. They are found only in prokaryotes and their four constitutive domains are usually encoded by independent polypeptides (two ABC proteins and two TMD proteins). Prokaryotic importers require additional extracytoplasmic binding proteins (one or more per systems) for function. In contrast, export systems are involved in the extrusion of noxious substances, the export of extracellular toxins and the targeting of membrane components. They are found in all living organisms and in general the TMD is fused to the ABC module in a variety of combinations. Some eukaryotic exporters encode the four domains on the same polypeptide chain [[cite:PUB00014769]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this family are presumed to act as permease subunits of ectoine ABC transporters. Operons containing this gene also contain other genes of the ABC transporter and are typically found next to either ectoine utilization or ectoine biosynthesis operons. Permease subunits EhuC and EhuD are homologues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035906", "name" "MetI-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03004" "ectoine/hydroxyectoine ABC transporter permease subunit EhuC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ectoine/hydroxyectoine ABC transporter, permease protein EhuC", "short" "Ectoine_EhuC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 978, "taxa" 3731, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3401, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3401, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2720}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0651", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0651"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014342", :literature {"PUB00014769" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Saurin W" "Hofnung M" "Dassa E."], "ISO_journal" "J.
