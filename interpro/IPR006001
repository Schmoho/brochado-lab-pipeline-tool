{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes thermoresistant and thermosensitve isozymes of gluconate kinase (gluconokinase) in E. coli and other related proteins; members of this family are often named by similarity to the thermostable isozyme. These proteins show homology to shikimate kinases and adenylate kinases but not to gluconate kinases from the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. The structure of the E. coli thermoresistant gluconate kinase GntK has been revealed [[cite:PUB00076697]].  GntK catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to gluconate. The resulting product gluconate-6-phoshate is an important precursor of gluconate metabolism. GntK acts as a dimmer composed of two identical subunits [[cite:PUB00007925], [cite:PUB00080681]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1knq", "name" "Crystal structure of gluconate kinase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02021" "GntK"}, "panther" {"PTHR43442" "GLUCONOKINASE-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01313" "gluconokinase, GntK/IdnK-type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbohydrate kinase, thermoresistant glucokinase", "short" "Therm_gnt_kin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5527, "taxa" 20220, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19202, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14387}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1228", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1228"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
