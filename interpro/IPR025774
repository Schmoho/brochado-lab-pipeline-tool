{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of the class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases, including bacterial 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-hydroquinone methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00074807]] and plant plastid tocopherol O-methyltransferase (also known as g-TMT (gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase)). Tocopherol O-methyltransferase is involved in the synthesis of tocopherol (vitamin E). It methylates gamma- and delta-tocopherol to form beta- and alpha-tocopherol, respectively [[cite:PUB00057990], [cite:PUB00057991], [cite:PUB00057992]].\r\nThis family also includes 3-hydroxy-16-methoxy-2,3-dihydrotabersonine N-methyltransferase, an homologue of tocopherol methyltransferases involved in vindoline biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00087309]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (EC [ec:2.1.1.-]) constitute an important class of enzymes present in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as oxygen leading to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and a methylated molecule [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]]. All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]]. The substrates that are methylated by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small molecules, to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00006319]]. Methyltransferase are therefore involved in many essential cellular processes including biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]].
