{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Iron-dependent fumarate hydratase, or fumarase, is a bacterial enzyme that converts malate to fumarate. There are three fumarase proteins in Escherichia coli, FumA, FumB, and FumC, which fall into two biochemically distinct classes: class I (FumA, FumB) are dimeric enzymes and class II (FumC) are tetrameric enzymes, the latter sharing homology with eukaryotic enzymes [[cite:PUB00000586]]. This entry represents the class I enzymes. FumA functions in the citric acid cycle, accounting for 80% of the fumarase activity when the bacteria grows aerobically. FumB functions in the generation of fumarate as an anaerobic electron acceptor in the fermentative pathway that leads to the production of succinate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6uq8", "name" "Crystal structure of R421A variant of cytosolic fumarate hydratase from Leishmania major in a complex with S-malate and malonate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001394" "Iron-dependent fumarate hydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Iron-dependent fumarate hydratase", "short" "Fe_dep_fumarate_hydratase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4102, "taxa" 15862, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17741, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17694, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13566}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
