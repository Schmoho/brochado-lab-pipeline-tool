{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of sequences are classed as unassigned endopeptidases belonging to the MEROPS peptidase family A31 (HybD endopeptidase family, clan AE). The sequences in this family represent the delta subunit, FrhD, of the nickel-containing 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin reducing hydrogenase, otherwise known as coenzyme F420-reducing hydrogenase. The delta subunit is not part of the active FRH heterotrimer, but is probably a protease required for maturation. The alpha subunit contains the metallo centre, which binds nickel. When nickel binds to the metallo centre the alpha subunit is processed to the active enzyme by cleavage at a conserved site near the C terminus. The delta subunit is thought to be responsible for these cleavages [[cite:PUB00009571]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023430", "name" "Peptidase HybD-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06064" "H2MP_F420-Reduc"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00130" "coenzyme F420-reducing hydrogenase, FrhD protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase A31, coenzyme F420-reducing hydrogenase delta subunit", "short" "Pept_A31_F420-red_hyd_d"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 55, "taxa" 433, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 388, "sets" 0, "proteins" 388, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 330}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0723", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0723"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
