{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mycothiol, a glutathione analog in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species, can form a disulphide-linked dimer called mycothione. This enzyme can reduce mycothione to regenerate two mycothiol molecules. The enzyme shows some sequence similarity to glutathione-disulphide reductase, trypanothione-disulphide reductase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The characterised protein from M. tuberculosis, a homodimer, has one FAD cofactor per monomer, and uses NADPH as a substrate [[cite:PUB00042971]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03452" "mycothione reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mycothione reductase", "short" "Mycothione_reductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 396, "taxa" 1335, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1191, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1191, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 975}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0923", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0923"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
