{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents human Kelch domain-containing protein 3 (KLHDC3) and similar proteins mainly found in animals. KLHDC3, also known as Testis intracellular mediator protein or PEAS, is the substrate-recognition component of a Cul2-RING (CRL2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognises a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation. This C-degron ris usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms [[cite:PUB00155310], [cite:PUB00155311]]. The degradation process is particularly relevant for truncated selenoproteins that result from unsuccessful decoding events [[cite:PUB00155309]]. Additionally, these proteins may play a role in the meiotic recombination process [[cite:PUB00155308]]. Members of this family contain a Kelch-type β-propeller domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9d1z", "name" "Structure of G75Q Ubiquitin bound to KLHDC3-EloB/C"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015915", "name" "Kelch-type beta propeller", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46461" "KELCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kelch domain-containing protein 3-like", "short" "KLHDC3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1048, "taxa" 4369, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2539, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1607}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052637", :literature {"PUB00155310" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lin HC" "Yeh CW" "Chen YF" "Lee TT" "Hsieh PY" "Rusnac DV" "Lin SY" "Elledge SJ" "Zheng N" "Yen HS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.04.006", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "C-Terminal End-Directed Protein Elimination by CRL2 Ubiquitin Ligases.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "602-613.e3", "volume" "70", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29775578}, "PUB00155309" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6243", "authors" ["Lin HC" "Ho SC" "Chen YY" "Khoo KH" "Hsu PH" "Yen HC."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aab0515", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "SELENOPROTEINS.
