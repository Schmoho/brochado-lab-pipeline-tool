{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Na(+)-translocating E subunit from NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. NADH can be oxidized by the respiratory chain of bacteria via NADH:quinone oxidoreductases that belong to three distinct enzyme families: NDH-1, NDH-2, and NQR. The NQR-type enzymes are sodium-motive NADH:quinone oxidoreductases consisting of six subunits (NqrA-F) and several cofactors: FAD, 2 FMN, a 2Fe-2S cluster and riboflavin. The NADH:quinone oxidoreductase activity of these enzymes is stimulated by sodium ions and is coupled with pumping of Na+ but not H+. Subunits NqrA, NqrC and NqrF represent the three major subunits of the NQR complex, which are alpha, gamma and beta, respectively. Subunits NqrB, NqrD and NqrE are very hydrophobic polypeptides that were found to co-localise with the alpha subunit [[cite:PUB00014919]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00429" "Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase subunit E [nqrE]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01940" "NADH:ubiquinone reductase (Na(+)-transporting) subunit E"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase subunit E", "short" "NqrE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1543, "taxa" 6539, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6623, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6623, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5105}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0129", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0129"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
