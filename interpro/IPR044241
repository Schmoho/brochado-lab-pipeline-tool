{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of thiol:disulfide interchange proteins, including TxlA from Cyanobacteria and HCF164 from Arabidopsis. HCF164 is a membrane-anchored thioredoxin-like protein that acts as a transducer of reducing equivalents in the thylakoid lumen. It contains a membrane-spanning sequence and a thioredoxin-like CXXC motif in the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. The hcf164 mutant was found to be impaired in the stable assembly of the cytochrome b6 f complex within thylakoid membrane [[cite:PUB00095537]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47353" "THIOREDOXIN-LIKE PROTEIN HCF164, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiol:disulfide interchange protein TxlA/HCF164", "short" "TxlA/HCF164"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 522, "taxa" 2717, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1735, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1735, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1150}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044241", :literature {"PUB00095537" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Motohashi K" "Hisabori T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
