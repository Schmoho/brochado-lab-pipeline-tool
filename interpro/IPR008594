{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents scavenger mRNA decapping enzymes, such as Dcp2 and DcpS.  DcpS is a scavenger pyrophosphatase that hydrolyses the residual cap structure following 3' to 5' mRNA degradation.  DcpS uses cap dinucleotides or capped oligonucleotides as substrate to release m(7)GMP (N7-methyl GMP), while Dcp2 uses capped mRNA as substrate in order to hydrolyse the cap to release m(7)GDP (N7-methyl GDP) [[cite:PUB00035577]]. The association of DcpS with 3' to 5' exonuclease exosome components suggests that these two activities are linked and there is a coupled exonucleolytic decay-dependent decapping pathway. The family contains a histidine triad (HIT) sequence with three histidines separated by hydrophobic residues [[cite:PUB00035578]]. The central histidine within the DcpS HIT motif is critical for decapping activity and defines the HIT motif as a new mRNA decapping domain, making DcpS the first member of the HIT family of proteins with a defined biological function. This family is related to ([interpro:IPR001310]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bl9", "name" "Synthetic Gene Encoded DcpS bound to inhibitor DG157493"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036265", "name" "HIT-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011145", "name" "Scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05652" "Scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme (DcpS) N-terminal"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF028973" "Scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme DcpS"}, "panther" {"PTHR12978" "HISTIDINE TRIAD HIT PROTEIN MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme DcpS/DCS2", "short" "DcpS/DCS2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 77, "proteomes" 2248, "taxa" 7460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3715, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3631, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2404}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
