{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The olfactory receptors of terrestrial animals exist in an aqueous environment, yet detect odorants that are primarily hydrophobic. The aqueous solubility of hydrophobic odorants is thought to be greatly enhanced via odorant binding proteins which exist in the extracellular fluid surrounding the odorant receptors [[cite:PUB00003450]]. This family is composed of pheromone binding proteins (PBP) and general-odorant binding proteins (GOBP). GOBPs and PBPs form a subgroup of the insect odorant binding proteins (OBPs). PBPs are male-specific and associate with pheromone-sensitive neurons [[cite:PUB00003450]]. This entry also includes Short and Long form salivary proteins having one or two odorant-binding protein-like domains and involved in binding diverse range of compounds [[cite:PUB00155430], [cite:PUB00153413]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1org", "name" "The crystal structure of a pheromone binding protein from the cockroach Leucophaea maderae reveals a new mechanism of pheromone binding"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036728", "name" "Pheromone/general odorant binding protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01395" "PBP/GOBP family"}, "smart" {"SM00708" "Insect pheromone/odorant binding protein domains."}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pheromone/general odorant binding protein", "short" "PBP/GOBP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 133, "domain_architectures" 97, "proteomes" 160, "taxa" 1699, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13720, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12985, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9239}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006170", :literature {"PUB00003450" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Vogt RG" "Prestwich GD" "Lerner MR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
