{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Probable splicing factor YJU2B (also known as CCDC130) and Splicing factor YJU2 (also known as CCDC94) from humans, Saf4 from fission yeasts and Yju2 from budding yeasts. Saf4 (also known as cwc16) is involved in mRNA splicing where it associates with cdc5 and the other cwf proteins as part of the spliceosome [[cite:PUB00008533]]. Yju2 is a splicing factor that is associated with the Prp19-associated complex and acts after Prp2 in promoting the first catalytic reaction of pre-mRNA splicing. It may play a role in stabilizing the structure of the spliceosome catalytic core [[cite:PUB00079198], [cite:PUB00094479]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12111" "SPLICING FACTOR YJU2"}, "pfam" {"PF04502" "Saf4/Yju2 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Saf4/Yju2 protein", "short" "Saf4/Yju2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 152, "proteomes" 2676, "taxa" 10571, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9543, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9371, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5660}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007590", :literature {"PUB00008533" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Ohi MD" "Link AJ" "Ren L" "Jennings JL" "McDonald WH" "Gould KL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
