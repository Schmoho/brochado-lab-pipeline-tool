Vertebrate ELKS proteins are produced by two genes, ERC1 and ERC2. Caenorhabditis elegans expresses a homologue of ELKS that acts downstream of syd2/liprin-alpha during active zone assembly [[cite:PUB00072837]]. Drosophila melanogaster expresses a related protein termed bruchpilot (brp) that consists of a conserved N terminus and a C-terminal half with no homologous sequences in vertebrates. Brp is required for structural integrity and function of synaptic active zones [[cite:PUB00073372]]. Vertebrate ELKS proteins are enriched at presynaptic active zones [[cite:PUB00073372]] and support Ca2+ influx at nerve terminals of inhibitory hippocampal neurons [[cite:PUB00073370]]. They have a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that binds directly to RIM (a small G protein Rab-3A effector).
