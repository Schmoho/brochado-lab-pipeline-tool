{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sigma-2 receptor, also known as TMEM97, is an intracellular orphan receptor highly expressed in various rapidly proliferating cancer cells and regarded as a cancer cell biomarker. It is a cytochrome-related protein that binds to various pharmacological compounds, and modulates the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, dopaminergic transmission, and cocaine-induced addiction behavior [[cite:PUB00086651], [cite:PUB00086652], [cite:PUB00086653]].
