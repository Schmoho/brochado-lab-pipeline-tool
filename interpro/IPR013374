{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This model describes a protein involved in type IV pilus biogenesis designated PilB in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but PilF in Neisseria gonorrhoeae; the more common usage, reflected here, is PilB. This protein is an ATPase involved in protein export for pilin assembly, and is closely related to GspE ([interpro:IPR013369]) of type II secretion systems (also referred to as the main terminal branch of the general secretion pathway). Note that type IV pilus systems are often divided into type IV-A and IV-B, with the latter group including bundle-forming pilus, mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin, etc. Members of this family are found in type IV-A systems.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02538" "type IV-A pilus assembly ATPase PilB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATPase, type IV, pilus assembly, PilB", "short" "ATPase_typ4_pilus-assembl_PilB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1314, "taxa" 6058, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6934, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6934, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5306}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013374", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016887", "name" "ATP hydrolysis activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009297", "name" "pilus assembly", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR013374", "name" "ATPase, type IV, pilus assembly, PilB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
