{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 2 (ELOVL2, also known as very long chain fatty acid elongase 2) is a component of the the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle [[cite:PUB00153162]]. It is a transmembrane enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum that adds two carbons per cycle to long- and very long-chain fatty acids acting on polyunsaturated acyl-CoA with the higher activity toward C20:4(n-6) acyl-CoA. It catalyzes the synthesis of polyunsaturated very long chain fatty acid (C20- and C22-PUFA), acting specifically toward polyunsaturated acyl-CoA with the higher activity toward C20:4(n-6) acyl-CoA[[cite:PUB00079978]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03202" "Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 2 [ELOVL2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 2", "short" "ELOVL2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 359, "taxa" 1298, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 512, "sets" 0, "proteins" 512, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 346}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
