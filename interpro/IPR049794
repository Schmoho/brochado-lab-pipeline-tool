DISARM is probably a multi-gene restriction module, but  DrmE has an unknown function. Expression of DISARM in B.subtilis (strain BEST7003) confers resistance to phages Nf, phi29, phi105, phi3T, SPO1, SPR and SPP1. DISARM does not interfere with phage adsorption, but instead interferes with (phi3T) DNA replication early in its cycle, preventing replication, circularization and lysogeny and probably causes phage DNA degradation [[cite:PUB00105719]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038316" "DrmE family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DISARM protein DrmE", "short" "DrmE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 44, "taxa" 504, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 181, "sets" 0, "proteins" 181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 142}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049794", :literature {"PUB00105719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ofir G" "Melamed S" "Sberro H" "Mukamel Z" "Silverman S" "Yaakov G" "Doron S" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "DISARM is a widespread bacterial defence system with broad anti-phage activities.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "90-98", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29085076}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049794", "name" "DISARM protein DrmE", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
