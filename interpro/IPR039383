{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>FHIT (fragile histidine) proteins are related to the HIT family members that carry a motif HxHxH/Qxx (x, is a hydrophobic amino acid) [[cite:PUB00005228]]. On the basis of sequence, substrate specificity, structure, evolution and mechanism, HIT proteins are classified into three branches: the Hint branch, which consists of adenosine 5' -monophosphoramide hydrolases, the FHIT branch, that consists of diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolases, and the GalT branch consisting of specific nucloside monophosphate transferases [[cite:PUB00008005], [cite:PUB00001122], [cite:PUB00008004]]. FHIT plays a very important role in the development of tumours. In fact, FHIT deletions are among the earliest and most frequent genetic alterations in the development of tumours [[cite:PUB00015781], [cite:PUB00089564]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fit", "name" "FHIT (FRAGILE HISTIDINE TRIAD PROTEIN)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036265", "name" "HIT-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01275" "FHIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FHIT family", "short" "FHIT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4172, "taxa" 15938, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14475, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14471, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10901}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
