{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant glycosyltransferases, including HPAT1-3 and SERGT1 from Arabidopsis. HPAT1 is a hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase involved in the O-arabinosylation of several proteins including extensins and small signaling peptides [[cite:PUB00097319], [cite:PUB00097320]]. It catalyses the transfer of the initial L-arabinose to the hydroxyl group of Hyp residues [[cite:PUB00097319]]. SERGT1, also known as AtSGT1, is a peptidyl serine O-alpha-galactosyltransferase [[cite:PUB00097321]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry also include PLENTY from Lotus japonicus [[cite:PUB00097322]]  and RDN1/2 (ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1/2) from Medicago truncatula [[cite:PUB00097323]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31485" "PEPTIDYL SERINE ALPHA-GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyltransferase HPAT/SRGT1-like", "short" "HPAT/SRGT1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 354, "taxa" 1524, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2080}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
