{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MMACHC, also known as Cyanocobalamin reductase / alkylcobalamin dealkylase, is involved in the intracellular processing of vitamin B12 by catalyzing two reactions: the reductive decyanation of cyanocobalamin in the presence of a flavoprotein oxidoreductase and the dealkylation of alkylcobalamins through the nucleophilic displacement of the alkyl group by glutathione [[cite:PUB00080494], [cite:PUB00080493]]. Mutations in the MMACHC gene have been linked to a disease known as Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cblC type (OMIM 277400), the most common inborn error of vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) metabolism. The C-terminal region of this protein folds similarly to TonB, a bacterial protein involved in energy transduction for cobalamin uptake [[cite:PUB00076174]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of MMACHC reveals it to be the most divergent member of the NADPH-dependent flavin reductase family that can use FMN or FAD to catalyze reductive decyanation; it is also the first enzyme with glutathione transferase (GST) activity that is unrelated to the GST superfamily in structure and sequence [[cite:PUB00056390]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7wuz", "name" "Structural study of the complex of cblC methylmalonic aciduria and homocysteinuria-related protein MMACHC with cyanocobalamin"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd12959" "Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein and similar proteins"}, "panther" {"PTHR31457" "METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA AND HOMOCYSTINURIA TYPE C PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF16690" "Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C family", "short" "MMACHC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 842, "taxa" 3170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1348, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 947}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
