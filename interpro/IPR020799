{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian protein kinase A anchoring protein 3 (PRKA3) or A-kinase anchor protein 110kDa (AKAP 110) sequences. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP are potent stimulators of sperm motility. Anchoring inhibitor peptides, designed to disrupt the interaction of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), are potent inhibitors of sperm motility. PKA anchoring is a key biochemical mechanism controlling motility. AKAP110 shares compartments with both RI and RII isoforms of PKA and may function as a regulator of both motility- and head-associated functions such as capacitation and the acrosome reaction [[cite:PUB00011239]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00807" "A-kinase anchor protein 110 kDa"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "A-kinase anchor 110kDa", "short" "AKAP_110"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 167, "taxa" 606, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 624, "sets" 0, "proteins" 623, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 385}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020799", :literature {"PUB00011239" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Vijayaraghavan S" "Liberty GA" "Mohan J" "Winfrey VP" "Olson GE" "Carr DW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
