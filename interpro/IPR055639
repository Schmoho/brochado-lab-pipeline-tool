{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a domain of unknown function found in phage proteins, typically 45-60 amino acids in length. It is found in Streptomyces phages of the Caudoviricetes order, primarily in the Arquatrovirinae subfamily. The domain does not contain any conserved motifs or residues that provide hints about its function. A structure prediction shows that it is composed of two non-interacting alpha helices.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23852" "Family of unknown function (DUF7215)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7215", "short" "DUF7215"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 94, "sets" 0, "proteins" 94, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055639", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055639", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7215", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 12, "alignment:full" 27}}}
