{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents DnaB-like replicative helicase (also known as gp41) from Bacteriophage T4, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase essential for viral DNA replication and recombination [[cite:PUB00100556]]. This protein moves 5'->3' on the lagging strand template, unwinding the DNA duplex ahead of the leading strand polymerase at the replication fork and generating ssDNA for both leading and lagging strand synthesis [[cite:PUB00100557], [cite:PUB00100555]]. It interacts with the primase, which allows the primase to initiate lagging strand synthesis and fully activates the helicase [[cite:PUB00100551], [cite:PUB00100555]]. This helicase is loaded by the helicase assembly factor on replication forks that begin at discrete replication origin sequences, as well as on forks that are created during recombination [[cite:PUB00100556]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04155" "DnaB-like replicative helicase [41]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage T4 DnaB-like replicative helicase", "short" "Helic_T4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 163, "taxa" 1659, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1094, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1094, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 59}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
