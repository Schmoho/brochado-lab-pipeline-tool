{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consist of coat proteins from closterovirus, which belong to the Closteroviridae, which have a positive strand ssRNA genome with no DNA stage during replication. The viral coat protein encapsulates and protects the viral genome. Both the large cp1 and smaller cp2 coat protein originate from the same primary transcript [[cite:PUB00003136]]. Members of the Closterovirus include Beet yellows virus (BYV) (Sugar beet yellows virus) and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 7.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01785" "Closterovirus coat protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Closterovirus coat protein", "short" "Closter_coat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 184, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3848, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3847, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002679", :literature {"PUB00003136" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sekiya ME" "Lawrence SD" "McCaffery M" "Cline K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
