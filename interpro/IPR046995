{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RGS (Regulator of G protein Signalling) proteins are multi-functional, GTPase-accelerating proteins that promote GTP hydrolysis by the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, thereby inactivating the G protein and rapidly switching off G protein-coupled receptor signalling pathways.  Upon activation by GPCRs, heterotrimeric G proteins exchange GDP for GTP, are released from the receptor, and dissociate into free, active GTP-bound alpha subunit and beta-gamma dimer, both of which activate downstream effectors. The response is terminated upon GTP hydrolysis by the alpha subunit, which can then bind the beta-gamma dimer and the receptor. RGS proteins markedly reduce the lifespan of GTP-bound alpha subunits by stabilising the G protein transition state [[cite:PUB00046994], [cite:PUB00087788]]. The human genome encode more than three dozen RGS domain-containing proteins with varied G-alpha substrate specificities, and are classified in eight different subfamilies: A or RZ; B or R4; C or R7; D or R12; E or RA; F or GEF; G or GRK (GPCR kinase) and H or SNX (sorting nexin) [[cite:PUB00087788]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the R12 RGS subfamily, which includes RGS10, RGS12 and RGS14 proteins, all of which are highly selective for G-alpha-i1 over G-alpha-q. This entry also includes regulator of G-protein signalling loco from Drosophila melanogaster, which is an RGS14 orthologue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45945" "REGULATOR OF G-PROTEIN SIGNALING LOCO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Regulator of G-protein signaling 10/12/14-like", "short" "RGS10/12/14-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 997, "taxa" 3872, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5074, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5074, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2616}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046995", :literature {"PUB00046994" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Soundararajan M" "Willard FS" "Kimple AJ" "Turnbull AP" "Ball LJ" "Schoch GA" "Gileadi C" "Fedorov OY" "Dowler EF" "Higman VA" "Hutsell SQ" "Sundstrom M" "Doyle DA" "Siderovski DP."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
