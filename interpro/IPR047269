{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ZMY11 and similar proteins from animals.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Zinc finger MYND domain-containing protein 11 (ZMYND11 or ZMY11, also known as protein BS69) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein acting as a transcriptional co-repressor in association with various transcription factors [[cite:PUB00102401]]. This protein specifically recognises H3K36me3 on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) and regulates RNA polymerase II elongation [[cite:PUB00102401]]. It is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for tumour cell growth. It was originally identified as an adenovirus 5 E1A-binding protein that inhibits E1A transactivation, as well as c-Myb transcription [[cite:PUB00085451], [cite:PUB00102402], ]. It also mediates repression, at least in part, through interaction with the co-repressor N-CoR [[cite:PUB00015108]]. Moreover, it interacts with Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain (TIR)-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM-1, also named TRIF) to facilitate NF-kappaB activation and type I IFN induction. It associates with PIAS1, a SUMO E3 enzyme, and Ubc9, a SUMO E2 enzyme, and plays an inhibitory role in muscle and neuronal differentiation [[cite:PUB00102412]].</p>\n\n<p>ZMY11 regulates Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)/C-terminal activation region 2 (CTAR2)-mediated NF-kappaB activation by interfering with the complex formation between TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and LMP1/CTAR2 [[cite:PUB00102405], [cite:PUB00102410]]. It also cooperates with tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) in the regulation of EBV-derived LMP1/CTAR1-induced NF-kappaB activation [[cite:PUB00102400]]. Furthermore, ZMY11 is involved in the p53-p21Cip1-mediated senescence pathway [[cite:PUB00102411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false,
