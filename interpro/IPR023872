{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A common motif in bacterial biosynthesis of polysaccharide for export is modification that follows polymerisation. This entry describes a family of polysaccharide N-deacetylases that act on poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus. The end product in these species is designated polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is a biofilm adhesin polysaccharide. The N-deacetylation step is crucial for attachment of the polysaccharide to the bacterial cell surface; it leads to the introduction of positive charges in the otherwise neutral PIA polymer, allowing electrostatic interactions [[cite:PUB00055027]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03933" "intercellular adhesin biosynthesis polysaccharide N-deacetylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine N-deacetylase", "short" "PNAG_deacetylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 111, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 107, "sets" 0, "proteins" 107, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 74}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
