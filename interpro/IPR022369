TerC has been implicated in resistance to tellurium, and may be involved in efflux of tellurium ions.  The tellurite-resistant Escherichia coli strain KL53 was found during testing of a group of clinical isolates for antibiotic and heavy metal ion resistance [[cite:PUB00008408]].  The determinant of the strain's tellurite resistance was located on a large conjugative plasmid, and analyses showed the genes terB, terC, terD and terE were essential for conservation of this resistance.
