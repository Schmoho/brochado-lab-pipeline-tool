{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial ethanolamine ammonia-lyase heavy chain (EutB) (also known as ethanolamine ammonia lyase large subunit and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase alpha subunit) proteins. Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyses the adenosylcobalamin-dependent conversion of certain vicinal amino alcohols to oxo compounds and ammonia. The enzyme consists of EutB and C (beta-subunit) subunits which form a trimer composed of the (α-β)2 dimer [[cite:PUB00002563], [cite:PUB00097599]]. EutB is organised in a (β/α)8 barrel which contains the active site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR044941", "name" "Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase heavy chain, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR044939", "name" "Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase heavy chain, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00861" "Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase large subunit [eutB]"}, "panther" {"PTHR39329" "ETHANOLAMINE AMMONIA-LYASE HEAVY CHAIN"}, "pfam" {"PF06751" "Ethanolamine ammonia lyase large subunit (EutB)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018788" "Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase heavy chain", "short" "EutB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 1631, "taxa" 7836, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7963, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7947, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6248}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1762", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1762"} {"accession" "GenProp1167", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1167"} {"accession" "GenProp0294", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0294"} {"accession" "GenProp0292", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0292"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
