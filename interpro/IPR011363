{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Dorsal morphogen directs formation of the Drosophila dorsoventral axis by both activating and repressing transcription. It contains an N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for DNA binding and regulated nuclear import, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that contains activation and repression motifs [[cite:PUB00014581]]. In wild-type embryos, the dorsal protein is found in the cytoplasm during cleavage. After the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the embryo, a ventral-to-dorsal gradient of nuclear dorsal protein is established [[cite:PUB00014582]].</p>\r\n<p>Dorsal-related immunity factor Dif does not appear to participate in dorsoventral patterning, but instead mediates an immune response in Drosophila larvae. Dif is normally localised in the cytoplasm of the larval fat body, but quickly accumulates in the nucleus upon bacterial infection or injury. Once in the nucleus, Dif binds to kappa B-like sequence motifs present in promoter regions of immunity genes [[cite:PUB00073044]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001716" "Dorsal protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dorsal-related immunity factor Dif", "short" "Dif"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 421, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 195, "sets" 0, "proteins" 167, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 126}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011363", :literature {"PUB00073044" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ip YT" "Reach M" "Engstrom Y" "Kadalayil L" "Cai H" "Gonzalez-Crespo S" "Tatei K" "Levine M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90495-C", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Dif, a dorsal-related gene that mediates an immune response in Drosophila.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "753-63", "volume" "75", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8242747}, "PUB00014581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Jia S" "Flores-Saaib RD" "Courey AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
