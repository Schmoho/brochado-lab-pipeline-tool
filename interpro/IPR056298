{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents uncharacterised bacterial proteins that have similarity to AlkZ-like proteins [interpro:IPR009351]. AlkZ adopts a unique fold in which three tandem winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs scaffold a positively charged concave surface shaped for binding to duplex DNA [[cite:PUB00100682]]. In contrast, the members of this family contain two instead of three tandem HTH motifs. They still probably retain the basic interface to bind DNA, however it is unclear whether these proteins possess enzymatic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24741" "AlkZ related"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AlkZ related", "short" "AlkZ-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 298, "taxa" 1470, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1676, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1676, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056298", :literature {"PUB00100682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Mullins EA" "Warren GM" "Bradley NP" "Eichman BF."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Structure of a DNA glycosylase that unhooks interstrand cross-links.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "4400-4405", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28396405}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056298", "name" "AlkZ related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 175, "alignment:full" 332}}}
