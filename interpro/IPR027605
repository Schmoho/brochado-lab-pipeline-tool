{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In at least ten species of Lactobacillus, this close homologue to known ornithine decarboxylase occurs in a three-gene neighbourhood, along with an amino acid permease family transporter and pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enyzme from the cystathionine gamma-lyase family. Species include L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. farciminis, L. helveticus, L. johnsonii, etc. The combination of a decarboxylase with an antiporter in a two-gene system suggests a decarboxylation/antiport proton-motive cycle for transient resistance to acidic conditions. The substrate for this decarboxylase might be ornithine but is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04318" "putative ornithine decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative ornithine decarboxylase, Lactobacillus", "short" "Lacto_ODC_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 152, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 207, "sets" 0, "proteins" 207, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 144}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027605", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR011193", "name" "Ornithine/lysine/arginine decarboxylase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR027568", "name" "Ornithine decarboxylase SpeF", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027605", "name" "Putative ornithine decarboxylase, Lactobacillus", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
