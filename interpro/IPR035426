{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Gem2 (also known as SIP1) from animals, Brr1 from budding yeasts and Yip11/Yip12 from fission yeasts. Gem2 is part of the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex that is involved in UsnRNP assembly in the cytoplasm and mediates nuclear import of the assembled UsnRNP [[cite:PUB00085360]].
