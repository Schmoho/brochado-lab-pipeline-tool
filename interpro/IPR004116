{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amelogenins, cell adhesion proteins, play a role in the biomineralisation of teeth. They seem to regulate formation of crystallites during the secretory stage of tooth enamel development and are thought to play a major role in the structural organisation and mineralisation of developing enamel. The extracellular matrix of the developing enamel comprises two major classes of protein: the hydrophobic amelogenins and the acidic enamelins [[cite:PUB00011224]].</p>\n\n<p>Circular dichroism studies of porcine amelogenin have shown that the protein consists of 3 discrete folding units [[cite:PUB00011225]]: the N-terminal region appears to contain β-strand structures, while the C-terminal region displays characteristics of a random coil conformation. Subsequent studies on the bovine protein have indicated the amelogenin structure to contain a repetitive β-turn segment and a \"β-spiral\" between Gln112 and Leu138, which sequester a (Pro, Leu, Gln) rich region [[cite:PUB00011226]]. The β-spiral offers a probable site for interactions with Ca2+ ions.</p>\n\n<p>Muatations in the human amelogenin gene (AMGX) cause X-linked hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, a disease characterised by defective enamel. A 9bp deletion in exon 2 of AMGX results in the loss of codons for Ile5, Leu6, Phe7 and Ala8, and replacement by a new threonine codon, disrupting the 16-residue (Met1-Ala16) amelogenin signal peptide [[cite:PUB00011227]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46794" "AMELOGENIN, Y ISOFORM"}, "smart" {"SM00818" "Amelogenin"}, "pfam" {"PF02948" "Amelogenin"}, "prints" {"PR01757" "AMELOGENIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amelogenin", "short" "Amelogenin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 154, "taxa" 1166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 925, "sets" 0, "proteins" 925, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 708}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004116", :literature {"PUB00011224" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Catalano-Sherman J" "Laskov R" "Palmon A" "David S" "Deutsch D."], "ISO_journal" "Calcif.
