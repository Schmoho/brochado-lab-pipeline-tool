{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Ccr4-Not complex is a global regulator of gene expression that is conserved from yeast to human. It affects genes positively and negatively and is thought to regulate transcription factor IID function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it exists in two prominent forms and consists of at least nine core subunits: the five Not proteins (Not1 to Not5), Caf1, Caf40, Caf130 and Ccr4 [[cite:PUB00044101]]. The Ccr4-Not complex regulates many different cellular functions, including RNA degradation and transcription initiation. It may be a regulatory platform that senses nutrient levels and stress [[cite:PUB00044102]]. Caf1 and Ccr4, are directly involved in mRNA deadenylation, and Caf1p is associated with Dhh1, a putative RNA helicase thought to be a component of the decapping complex [[cite:PUB00010586]]. Pop2, a component of the Ccr4-Not complex, functions as a deadenylase [[cite:PUB00044103]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents CCR4-NOT complex, subunits 3 and 5.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9c3h", "name" "Structure of the CNOT3-bound human 80S ribosome with tRNA-ARG in the P-site."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005290" "CCR4-NOT complex, subunits 3 and 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CCR4-NOT complex, subunit 3/ 5", "short" "CCR4-NOT_su3/5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2117, "taxa" 7374, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7554, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5413, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3287}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012270", :literature {"PUB00044101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Albert TK" "Lemaire M" "van Berkum NL" "Gentz R" "Collart MA" "Timmers HT."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/28.3.809", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Isolation and characterization of human orthologs of yeast CCR4-NOT complex subunits.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "809-17", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10637334}, "PUB00044102" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Collart MA."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(03)00672-3", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Global control of gene expression in yeast by the Ccr4-Not complex.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1-16", "volume" "313", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12957374}, "PUB00010586" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Maillet L" "Collart MA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
