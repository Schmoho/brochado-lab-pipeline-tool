{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins predominantly found in plants, including phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase 1 (PDCT1 or ROD1) and 2 (PDCT2) from Arabidopsis thaliana. PDCT1 catalyses the transfer of the phosphocholine headgroup from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to diacylglycerol, a major reaction for the transfer of 18:1 into phosphatidylcholine for desaturation and also for the reverse transfer of 18:2 and 18:3 into the triacylglycerols synthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00155341], [cite:PUB00155342], [cite:PUB00155343]].
