{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoglycerate kinase ([ec:2.7.2.3]) (PGK) is an enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP to ADP and vice versa. In the second step of the second phase in glycolysis, 1,3-diphosphoglycerate is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate, forming one molecule of ATP. If the reverse were to occur, one molecule of ADP would be formed. This reaction is essential in most cells for the generation of ATP in aerobes, for fermentation in anaerobes and for carbon fixation in plants.</p>\n\n<p>PGK is found in all living organisms and its sequence has been highly conserved throughout evolution. The enzyme exists as a monomer containing two nearly equal-sized domains that correspond to the N-and C-termini of the protein (the last 15 C-terminal residues loop back into the N-terminal domain). 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) binds to the N-terminal, while the nucleotide substrates, MgATP or MgADP, bind to the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. This extended two-domain structure is associated with large-scale 'hinge-bending' conformational changes, similar to those found in hexokinase [[cite:PUB00006511]]. At the core of each domain is a 6-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by α helices. Domain 1 has a parallel β-sheet of six strands with an order of 342156, while domain 2 has a parallel β-sheet of six strands with an order of 321456. Analysis of the reversible unfolding of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase leads to the conclusion that the two lobes are capable of folding independently, consistent with the presence of intermediates on the folding pathway with a single domain folded [[cite:PUB00006255]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wzb", "name" "The catalytically active fully closed conformation of human phosphoglycerate kinase in complex with ADP, 3PG and magnesium trifluoride"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015824", "name" "Phosphoglycerate kinase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036043", "name" "Phosphoglycerate kinase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00318" "Phosphoglycerate_kinase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00145" "Phosphoglycerate kinase [pgk]"}, "panther" {"PTHR11406" "PHOSPHOGLYCERATE KINASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000724" "Phosphoglycerate kinase"}, "pfam" {"PF00162" "Phosphoglycerate kinase"}, "prints" {"PR00477" "PHGLYCKINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoglycerate kinase", "short" "Phosphoglycerate_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 226, "proteomes" 12117, "taxa" 48481, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 59361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 58198, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 43961}, "pathways" 33}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1612", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1612"} {"accession" "GenProp1344", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1344"} {"accession" "GenProp1306", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1306"} {"accession" "GenProp1599", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1599"} {"accession" "GenProp1407", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1407"} {"accession" "GenProp0691", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0691"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
