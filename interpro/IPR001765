{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbonic anhydrases ([ec:4.2.1.1]) (CA) are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide.\nIn Escherichia coli, CA (gene cynT) is involved in recycling carbon dioxide formed in the bicarbonate-dependent decomposition of cyanate by cyanase (gene cynS). By this action, it prevents the depletion of cellular bicarbonate [[cite:PUB00002753]]. In photosynthetic bacteria and plant chloroplast, CA is essential to inorganic carbon fixation [[cite:PUB00004782]].\nProkaryotic and plant chloroplast CA are structurally and evolutionary related and form a family distinct from the one which groups the many different forms of eukaryotic CA's (see [interpro:IPR001148]).</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes the carbonyl sulfide hydrolase from Thiobacillus thioparus which responsible for the degradation of carbonyl sulfide to hydrogen sulfide and CO2, the second step of SCN(-) assimilation [[cite:PUB00065060]], and a carbon disulfide hydrolase from acidothermophilic archaeon Acidianus, which has a typical carbonic anhydrase fold and active site but does not use CO2 as a substrate [[cite:PUB00086422]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3las", "name" "Crystal structure of carbonic anhydrase from streptococcus mutans to 1.4 angstrom resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036874", "name" "Carbonic anhydrase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00947" "Carbonic anhydrase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11002" "CARBONIC ANHYDRASE", "PTHR43175" "CARBONIC ANHYDRASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00484" "Carbonic anhydrase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbonic anhydrase", "short" "Carbonic_anhydrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 75, "domain_architectures" 237, "proteomes" 9429, "taxa" 34396, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 59412, "sets" 0, "proteins" 59052, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 43559}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1072", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1072"} {"accession" "GenProp1669", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1669"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
