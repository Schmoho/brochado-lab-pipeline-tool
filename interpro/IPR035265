{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Colicins are bacterial toxins produced by Escherichia coli strains and are active against E. coli or related strains. These bacterial antibiotic toxins play an important role in the E. coli colonization of environmental niches. Colicin K uses the Tsx nucleoside-specific receptor for binding at the cell surface, the OmpA protein for translocation through the outer membrane, and the TolABQR proteins for the transit through the periplasm. The N-terminal domain interacts with components of its import machinery, including the TolB and TolQ proteins [[cite:PUB00085281]]. Members of this family are colicin K immunity proteins. These proteins are able to protect a cell against colicin K [[cite:PUB00093737]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17500" "Colicin-K immunity"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Colicin-K immunity", "short" "Colicin-K_immunity"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 25, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035265", :literature {"PUB00085281" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Barneoud-Arnoulet A" "Gavioli M" "Lloubes R" "Cascales E."], "ISO_journal" "J.
