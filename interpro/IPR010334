{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>An essential step in mRNA turnover is decapping.  In yeast, two proteins have been identified that are essential for decapping, Dcp1 (this family) and Dcp2. Dcp1 is a coactivator that binds to the decapping enzyme Dcp2 and forms a decapping enzyme complex, which removes the 5' cap structure from mRNAs prior to their degradation [[cite:PUB00033653]]. Yeast Dcp1 interact directly with Dcp2, however, the Dcp1-Dcp2 interaction is promoted by an additional factor, EDC4 [[cite:PUB00076141]]. In the nervous system, it promotes neurons' lifespan through the negative regulation of the insulin-like peptide ins-7 expression [[cite:PUB00096644]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5j3t", "name" "Crystal structure of S. pombe Dcp2:Dcp1:Edc1 mRNA decapping complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16290" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR SMIF DECAPPING ENZYME DCP1"}, "pfam" {"PF06058" "Dcp1-like decapping family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "mRNA-decapping enzyme subunit 1", "short" "Dcp1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 76, "proteomes" 2548, "taxa" 8604, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6612, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6239, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4090}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
