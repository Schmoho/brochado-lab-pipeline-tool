{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the presumed VPg protein from human astrovirus. Viral genome-linked proteins (VPgs) are virus-encoded small proteins that are covalently linked to the 5' terminus of many RNA viral genomes through a phosphodiester bond.  Viral genome-linked proteins (VPgs) have been identified in several single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus families. The protein resulting from this putative VPg coding region is a highly disordered protein [[cite:PUB00099064]]. A common feature of VPgs is that they are rich in basic amino acids [mostly Lys (K), Gly (G), Thr (T), and Arg (R)], which favors the interaction with the negatively charged RNA. Tyr-693 at the conserved TEEEY-like motif has been postulated to be the residue responsible for the covalent linkage to viral RNA. Mutagenesis of Tyr-693 in the VPg protein is lethal for HAstV replication [[cite:PUB00099064]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19416" "Astrovirus VPg protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Astrovirus VPg protein", "short" "Astro_VPg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 207, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 928, "sets" 0, "proteins" 928, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
