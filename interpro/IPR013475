{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amicyanin is a type I blue copper protein that accepts electrons from the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor of the methylamine dehydrogenase light chain and then transfers them to the haem group of cytochrome c-551i. Amicyanin, methylamine dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c-551i are located in the periplasm and form a complex. This system has been studied primarily in Paracoccus denitrificans and Methylobacterium extorquens. Related type I blue copper proteins include plastocyanin, pseudoazurin, halocyanin, etc.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ov0", "name" "Structure of the blue copper protein Amicyanin to 0.75 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02657" "amicyanin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amicyanin, Paracoccus/Methylobacterium", "short" "Amicyanin_Para/Methyl"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 41, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013475", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005507", "name" "copper ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009055", "name" "electron transfer activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001235", "name" "Blue (type 1) copper protein, plastocyanin-type", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR002386", "name" "Amicyanin/Pseudoazurin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR012745", "name" "Pseudoazurin", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR035668", "name" "Amicyanin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR013475", "name" "Amicyanin, Paracoccus/Methylobacterium", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]} {"accession" "IPR002387", "name" "Plastocyanin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023511", "name" "Plastocyanin, cyanobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
