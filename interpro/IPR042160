{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins that belong to transcription factors of the class IV homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip IV) protein family. This entry includes GLABRA2, ANTHOCYANINLESS2 (ANL2), ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1), and PROTODERMAL FACTOR2 (PDF2) from Arabidopsis. GLABRA2 regulates the frequency of trichome initiation and is involved in determining trichome spacing [[cite:PUB00092751]]. ANL2 is involved in anthocyanin distribution and root development [[cite:PUB00092752]]. PDF2 and ATML1 are involved in shoot epidermal cell differentiation. ATML1 and PDF2 function redundantly as a positive regulator of shoot epidermal cell differentiation and at least one copy of these genes is essential for embryo development [[cite:PUB00092753], [cite:PUB00092754]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45654" "HOMEOBOX-LEUCINE ZIPPER PROTEIN MERISTEM L1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homeobox-leucine zipper protein GLABRA2/ANL2/PDF2/ATML1-like", "short" "GLABRA2/ANL2/PDF2/ATML1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 253, "taxa" 1033, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4871}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042160", :literature {"PUB00092753" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Abe M" "Katsumata H" "Komeda Y" "Takahashi T."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.00292", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Regulation of shoot epidermal cell differentiation by a pair of homeodomain proteins in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "635-43", "volume" "130", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12505995}, "PUB00092751" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ohashi Y" "Oka A" "Ruberti I" "Morelli G" "Aoyama T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0960-7412.2001.01214.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Entopically additive expression of GLABRA2 alters the frequency and spacing of trichome initiation.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "359-69", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11844112}, "PUB00092754" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ogawa E" "Yamada Y" "Sezaki N" "Kosaka S" "Kondo H" "Kamata N" "Abe M" "Komeda Y" "Takahashi T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcv045", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "ATML1 and PDF2 Play a Redundant and Essential Role in Arabidopsis Embryo Development.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1183-92", "volume" "56", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25766904}, "PUB00092752" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Kubo H" "Peeters AJ" "Aarts MG" "Pereira A" "Koornneef M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.2307/3870744", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "ANTHOCYANINLESS2, a homeobox gene affecting anthocyanin distribution and root development in Arabidopsis.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1217-26", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10402424}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR042160", "name" "Homeobox-leucine zipper protein GLABRA2/ANL2/PDF2/ATML1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
