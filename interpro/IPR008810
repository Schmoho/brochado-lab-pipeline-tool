{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several virulence-associated proteins, mainly from Corynebacterium equii (Rhodococcus equi, Rhodococcus hoagii). R. equi is an important pulmonary pathogen of foals and is increasingly isolated from pneumonic infections and other infections in Homo sapiens immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Both virulent and avirulent strains of R. equi differ in the possession of a virulence-associated plasmid [[cite:PUB00011449]]. The type of virulence plasmid carried is host specific; the pVapA is the plasmid type carried by R. equi isolates infecting equine. These virulence plasmids have four common regions known as the conjugation, replication, unknown function and the virulence or pathogenicity island (PAI) regions, where the members of the vap (virulence associated protein) family reside [[cite:PUB00088270], [cite:PUB00088271]]. The virulence protein VapA has been shown to inhibit the maturation of R. equi-containing phagosomes and promote intracellular bacterial survival [[cite:PUB00088269]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4cv7", "name" "Crystal structure of Rhodococcus equi VapB"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038625", "name" "Rhodococcus equi virulence-associated superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05526" "Rhodococcus equi virulence-associated protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009221" "Virulence-associated protein, Rhodococcus equi type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhodococcus equi virulence-associated protein", "short" "R_equi_Vir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 45, "taxa" 323, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 194, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 148}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008810", :literature {"PUB00088270" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Letek M" "Ocampo-Sosa AA" "Sanders M" "Fogarty U" "Buckley T" "Leadon DP" "Gonzalez P" "Scortti M" "Meijer WG" "Parkhill J" "Bentley S" "Vazquez-Boland JA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
