{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [[cite:PUB00003337]]. The subfamilies are defined [[cite:PUB00009589]] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called capping domain [[cite:PUB00009540]], or the absence of such a domain. Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs. Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs. Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions.</p>\n\n<p>The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an Î±-helical bundle. Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an apparent phylogenetic bifurcation. Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)D, (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one. All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Three variant models were created by TIGRFAMs with some overlap among them to cover subfamily IA. This serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly related HAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2b0c", "name" "The crystal structure of the putative phosphatase from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01549" "HAD-IA family hydrolase", "TIGR01509" "HAD-IA family hydrolase", "TIGR01493" "HAD-IA family hydrolase"}, "prints" {"PR00413" "HADHALOGNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD hydrolase, subfamily IA", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 319, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12066, "taxa" 47281, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 423717, "sets" 0, "proteins" 296478, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 221427}, "pathways" 121}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1737", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1737"} {"accession" "GenProp1469", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1469"} {"accession" "GenProp1734", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1734"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
