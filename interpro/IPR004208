Influenza A virus employs a different strategy: its NS1 protein does not bind the ISG15 protein, but little or no ISG15 protein is produced during infection [[cite:PUB00007421]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038064", "name" "Influenza A virus NS1, effector domain-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02942" "Influenza B non-structural protein (NS1)"}, "hamap" {"MF_04066" "Non-structural protein 1 [NS]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003938" "Influenza B virus nonstructural protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Influenza non-structural protein (NS1)", "short" "NS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 58219, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 66197, "sets" 0, "proteins" 66196, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1013", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1013"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004208", :literature {"PUB00007421" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yuan W" "Krug RM."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/20.3.362", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Influenza B virus NS1 protein inhibits conjugation of the interferon (IFN)-induced ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "362-71", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11157743}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004208", "name" "Influenza non-structural protein (NS1)", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000256", "name" "Influenza A virus NS1 protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 4}}}
