{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenoviruses are medium-sized, non-enveloped viruses containing double-stranded DNA. They can cause a variety of diseases including pneumonia, cystitis, conjunctivitis and diarrhoea, all of which can be fatal to patients who are immunocompromised  [[cite:PUB00005244]]. These viruses have many mechanisms to evade the host immune response, including several proteins which are expressed as part of the early transcription unit 3 (E3) [[cite:PUB00034706]]. One of the regions of E3, known as the E3B region, encodes three proteins known as 10.4K, 14.5K and 14.7K. Two of these proteins, 10.4K and 14.5K, form the RID complex (receptor internalisation and degradation) which protects the infected cell from host-induced lysis by clearing the the TNF and Fas receptors from the cell surface [[cite:PUB00010442]]. Other receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, are also known to be cleared by RID [[cite:PUB00034707]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03376" "Adenovirus E3B protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus E3B protein", "short" "Adeno_E3B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 179, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005041", :literature {"PUB00005244" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Xia D" "Henry LJ" "Gerard RD" "Deisenhofer J."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(94)00126-X", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain of adenovirus type 5 fiber protein at 1.7 A resolution.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "1259-70", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7704534}, "PUB00034706" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Wold WS" "Tollefson AE" "Hermiston TW."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
