{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin is a bacterial protein toxin with an AB5 multimer structure, in which the B pentamer ([interpro:IPR001835])  has a membrane-binding function and the A chain is needed for enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00003304]]. The B subunits are arranged as a donut-shaped pentamer, each subunit participating in ~30 hydrogen bonds and 6 salt bridges with its two neighbours [[cite:PUB00003304]].</p>\r\n<p>The A subunit has a less well-defined secondary structure. It predominantly interacts with the pentamer via the C-terminal A2 fragment, which runs through the charged central pore of the B subunits. A putative catalytic residue in the A1 fragment (Glu112) lies close to a hydrophobic region, which packs two loops together. It is thought that this region might be important for catalysis and membrane translocation [[cite:PUB00003304]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2a5d", "name" "Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01375" "Heat-labile enterotoxin alpha chain"}, "prints" {"PR00771" "ENTEROTOXINA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heat-labile enterotoxin, A chain", "short" "Enterotoxin_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 141, "taxa" 600, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1109, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1087, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 803}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
