{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The lactate racemase enzyme (LarA) of Lactobacillus plantarum harbors a (SCS)Ni(II) pincer complex. Pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide synthase (LarB), together with LarC and LarE, is involved in the synthesis of the nickel-pincer cofactor of LarA [[cite:PUB00085157]]. LarB, LarC, and LarE are widely distributed in microorganisms. LarB carboxylates the pyridinium ring of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) and cleaves the phosphoanhydride bond to release AMP. Therefore, LarB converts NaAD into pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide (P2CMN). Subsequently LarE incorporates two sulfur atoms to yield P2TMN, and LarC donates Ni, so that the mature cofactor becomes covalently attached to LarA. In species where larA is absent, this pathway could be used to generate a pincer complex in other enzymes [[cite:PUB00086644]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033503" "nickel pincer cofactor biosynthesis protein LarB"}, "panther" {"PTHR43064" "PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINOIMIDAZOLE CARBOXYLASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide synthase", "short" "P2CMN_synthase_LarB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2122, "taxa" 10205, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11136, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8598}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
