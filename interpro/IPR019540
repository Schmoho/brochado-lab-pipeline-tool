{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class S protein (PIG-S, also known as Gpi17 in budding yeasts) is one of several key, core components of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) trans-amidase complex that adds GPIs to newly synthesized proteins [[cite:PUB00009845]]. Mammalian GPI transamidase consists of at least five components: Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U, all five of which are required for its function. It is possible that Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T form a tightly associated core that is only weakly associated with PIG-U [[cite:PUB00044439]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21072" "GPI TRANSAMIDASE COMPONENT PIG-S"}, "pfam" {"PF10510" "Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class S protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class S protein", "short" "PtdIno-glycan_biosynth_class_S"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 88, "proteomes" 2492, "taxa" 8394, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4743, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4382, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2833}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019540", :literature {"PUB00009845" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Fraering P" "Imhof I" "Meyer U" "Strub JM" "van Dorsselaer A" "Vionnet C" "Conzelmann A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
