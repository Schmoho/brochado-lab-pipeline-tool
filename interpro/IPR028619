{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA helicases from the DEAD-box family are found in almost all organisms and have important roles in RNA metabolism, such as splicing, RNA transport, ribosome biogenesis, translation and RNA decay. They are enzymes that unwind double-stranded RNA molecules in an energy dependent fashion through the hydrolysis of NTP. DEAD-box RNA helicases belong to superfamily 2 (SF2) of helicases. As other SF1 and SF2 members they contain seven conserved motifs which are characteristic of these two superfamilies [[cite:PUB00033617]]. DEAD-box is named after the amino acids of motif II or Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid).</p>\n\n<p>The RNA helicase DbpA has an RNA-dependent ATPase activity, which is specific for 23S rRNA [[cite:PUB00068864], [cite:PUB00068865]]. It is involved in assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00068866]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00965" "ATP-dependent RNA helicase DbpA [dbpA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent RNA helicase DbpA", "short" "DEAD_helicase_DbpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 450, "taxa" 2293, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2713, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2713, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2019}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
