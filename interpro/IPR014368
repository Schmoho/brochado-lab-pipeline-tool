{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:1.9.3.1]) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a component of the respiratory chain complex and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen [[cite:PUB00000581], [cite:PUB00101096]]. In fungi (as in other eukaryotes) this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane.</p>\n\n<p>In eukaryotes, in addition to the three large subunits, I, II and III, that form the catalytic centre of the enzyme complex, there are a variable number of small polypeptidic subunits. This family includes fungal-type cytochrome-c oxidase, subunit VIIa, also known as cytochrome c oxidase subunit 9, the orthologue of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C from mammals [[cite:PUB00101096], [cite:PUB00154382]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000283" "Cytochrome-c oxidase, subunit VIIa"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIIa, fungal", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_su7a_fun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 598, "taxa" 1836, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 824, "sets" 0, "proteins" 819, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 566}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014368", :literature {"PUB00000581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Capaldi RA" "Malatesta F" "Darley-Usmar VM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
