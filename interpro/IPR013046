{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of phage (and bacteriocin) proteins related to the phage P2 V gene product (GpV), which forms the small spikes on the baseplate that bind to the host cell and penetrate through the host membrane [[cite:PUB00061271]]. This entry also includes Gp45, which is a component of the baseplate that forms a central needlelike spike used to puncture the host cell membrane for tube insertion during virus entry [[cite:PUB00077063], [cite:PUB00065189]].
