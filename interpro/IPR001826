{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RHS (Rearrangement hotspot) proteins are distantly related to the wall-associated protein A (WapA) and mediate intercellular competition. The protein sequences comprise highly conserved 141kDa domain containing multiple tandem 22-residue repeats, the YD-peptide repeats that define this protein family. Rhs/YD-repeat proteins are widely distributed suggesting that they play a fundamental role in biology. Rhs C-terminal regions (Rhs-CT) are highly divergent [[cite:PUB00002114], [cite:PUB00003864], [cite:PUB00088067]]. Rhs-CT regions share sequence identity with toxic effector domains of contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems, which shows that these proteins inhibit the growth of neighboring cells in a contact-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00088067], [cite:PUB00097193]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00394" "RHSPROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF03527" "RHS protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RHS protein", "short" "RHS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 885, "proteomes" 1058, "taxa" 6235, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34176, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15245, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6950}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
