{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Maf transcription factors form a distinct subfamily of the basic leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors [[cite:PUB00056718]]. Maf genes have been identified in a wide range of higher eukaryotes, including both vertebrate and invertebrate species. These proteins are unique among the bZip factors in that they contain a highly conserved extended homology region (EHR), or ancillary DNA binding region, in addition to a typical basic region, and both regions are involved in target DNA sequence recognition. Maf transcription factors regulate tissue-specific gene expression and cell-differentiation in a wide variety of tissues and are also involved in human diseases and oncogenic transformation. Tissue-specific expression invloves Maf binding to Maf-recognition elements (MAREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes, and interacting with other transcription factors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10129" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MAF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor Maf family", "short" "Transcription_factor_Maf_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 945, "taxa" 3900, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6526, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4333}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024874", :literature {"PUB00056718" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Kataoka K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
