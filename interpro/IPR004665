{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rho-dependent transcription terminators participate in sophisticated genetic regulatory mechanisms, in both bacteria and phages; they occur in regulatory regions preceding the coding sequences of genes and within coding sequences, as well as at the end of transcriptional units, to prevent read through transcription.  Rho is the main factor required for termination; it is a ring-shaped hexameric protein with ATPase and helicase activities. Rho-dependent termination occurs by binding of Rho to ribosome-free mRNA, C-rich sites being good candidates for binding. Rho's ATPase is activated by Rho-mRNA binding, and provides the energy for Rho translocation along the mRNA; translocation requires sliding of the message into the central hole of the hexamer. When a polymerase pause site is encountered, the actual termination occurs, and the transcript is released by Rho's helicase activity [[cite:PUB00045823]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1a62", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE RNA-BINDING DOMAIN OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL TERMINATOR PROTEIN RHO"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036269", "name" "Rho termination factor, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46425" "TRANSCRIPTION TERMINATION FACTOR RHO"}, "hamap" {"MF_01884" "Transcription termination factor Rho [rho]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00767" "transcription termination factor Rho"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription termination factor Rho", "short" "Term_rho"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8401, "taxa" 32020, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41100, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41071, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31345}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0812", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0812"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
