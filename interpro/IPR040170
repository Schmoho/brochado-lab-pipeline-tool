{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family comprises bacterial [[cite:PUB00043443]] and cytosolyc acyl-CoA thioester hydrolases. In higher organisms, acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) catalyze hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA-SH. Different ACOT isoforms are localized to distinct cellular organelles. ACOT6 is a cytosolic isoform highly expressed in brain tissue and testis [[cite:PUB00090648]]. Other cytosolic isoforms include ACOT12, which appears to be the major cytoplasmic enzyme in the liver [[cite:PUB00090643], [cite:PUB00090646]], and   ACOT11, a brown fat inducible thioesterase [[cite:PUB00090647]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v1o", "name" "Crystal structure of N-terminal domain of acyl-CoA thioesterase 7"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029069", "name" "HotDog domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11049" "ACYL COENZYME A THIOESTER HYDROLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase", "short" "Cytosol_ACT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6733, "taxa" 26257, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40907, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40907, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31627}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
