{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Bacillus subtilis, one small SOS response operon under the control of LexA, the yneA operon, is comprised of three genes: yneA, yneB, and ynzC [[cite:PUB00053936]]. This family consists of several short, hypothetical bacterial proteins of unknown function. These proteins are mainly found in Gram-positive Firmicutes. Structures show that the N terminus is composed of two Î±-helices forming a helix-loop-helix motif. The structure of ynzC from B. subtilis forms a trimeric complex [[cite:PUB00047592]]. Structural modelling suggests this domain may bind nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00070793]]. This family is also known as UPF0291.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37300" "UPF0291 PROTEIN CBO2609/CLC_2481"}, "hamap" {"MF_01103" "UPF0291 protein <locus_tag>"}, "pfam" {"PF05979" "Bacterial protein of unknown function (DUF896)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF896", "short" "DUF896"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 1500, "taxa" 5379, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5617, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4338}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009242", :literature {"PUB00053936" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kawai Y" "Moriya S" "Ogasawara N."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
