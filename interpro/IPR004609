{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecG [ec:3.6.4.12] plays a critical role in recombination and DNA repair. It helps to process Holliday junction intermediates to mature products by catalysing branch migration. This entry includes RecG from bacteria the homologue from Arabidopsis, which has a critical role in recombination and DNA repair. RecG has DNA unwinding activity characteristic of a DNA helicase with 3' to 5' polarity. RecG unwind branched duplex DNA (Y-DNA) and has a role in constitutive stable DNA replication (CsdR) and R-loop formation [[cite:PUB00060423], [cite:PUB00060424], [cite:PUB00025306]]. It is genetically synergistic to RadA and RuvABC [[cite:PUB00098842]]. RecG comprises three structural domains, the largest N-terminal Domain 1 which interacts with DNA junctions, and Domains 2 and 3 at the C-terminal which contain the characteristic motifs that identify RecG as an SF2 helicase [[cite:PUB00025306]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00643" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecG", "short" "ATP-dep_DNA_helicase_RecG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5963, "taxa" 25292, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28761, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28761, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21597}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
