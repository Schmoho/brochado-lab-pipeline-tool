{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Precise duplication of chromosomal DNA is required for genomic stability during replication. A process called replication licensing ensures that chromosomes are replicated only once per cell cycle. To form a pre-replicative complex on replication origins in the G phase, ORC first binds origin DNA and triggers the binding of Cdc6 and Cdt1. These two factors recruit a putative replicative helicase and the MCM2-7. The MCM2-7 complex promotes the unwinding of DNA origins, and the binding of additional factors to initiate the DNA replication in S-phase. Cdt1 is present during G1 and early S phase of the cell cycle and degraded during the late S, G2, and M phases [[cite:PUB00098195], [cite:PUB00098196]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents Cdt1, which can be divided into three regions based on sequence comparison and biochemical analyses: the N-terminal region (Cdt1_n) binds DNA in a sequence-, strand-, and conformation-independent manner; the middle winged helix fold (Cdt1_m) binds geminin to inhibit both binding of the MCM complex to origins of replication and DNA; and the C-terminal region (Cdt1_c) is essential for Cdt1 activity and directly interacts with the MCM2-7 helicase. The winged helix fold structure of Cdt1_m is similar to the structures of Cdt1_c and other archaeal homologues of the eukaryotic replication initiator, without apparent sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00098195], [cite:PUB00032264]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3a4c", "name" "Crystal structure of cdt1 C terminal domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28637" "DNA REPLICATION FACTOR CDT1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA replication factor Cdt1", "short" "Cdt1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1313, "taxa" 5220, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3063, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3063, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1901}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045173", :literature {"PUB00098195" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["De Marco V" "Gillespie PJ" "Li A" "Karantzelis N" "Christodoulou E" "Klompmaker R" "van Gerwen S" "Fish A" "Petoukhov MV" "Iliou MS" "Lygerou Z" "Medema RH" "Blow JJ" "Svergun DI" "Taraviras S" "Perrakis A."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Quaternary structure of the human Cdt1-Geminin complex regulates DNA replication licensing.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "19807-12", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19906994}, "PUB00032264" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7002", "authors" ["Lee C" "Hong B" "Choi JM" "Kim Y" "Watanabe S" "Ishimi Y" "Enomoto T" "Tada S" "Kim Y" "Cho Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature02813", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structural basis for inhibition of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 by geminin.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "913-7", "volume" "430", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15286659}, "PUB00098196" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Nishitani H" "Lygerou Z."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Control of DNA replication licensing in a cell cycle.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "523-34", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12059957}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030174", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated DNA replication initiation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0071163", "name" "DNA replication preinitiation complex assembly", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045173", "name" "DNA replication factor Cdt1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
