{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Orexins (also known as hypocretins) are neuropeptides that are specifically localised to the hypothalamus. They are thought to interact with autonomic, neurendocrine and neuroregulatory systems, and play an important role in the regulation of feeding behaviour [[cite:PUB00004929], [cite:PUB00004918]]. When applied to hypothalamic neurones, these peptides are neuroexcitatory, which action is probably mediated by their binding to a new family of G-protein-coupled receptors (orexin receptors 1 and 2), which were previously orphan [[cite:PUB00000959]].</p>\n\n<p>To date, two orexins have been characterised (orexin-A and -B), both encoded by a single mRNA transcript (prepro-orexin or hypocretin neuropeptide precursor, whose product is represented in this entry): orexin-A is a 33-residue peptide with two intramolecular disulphide bonds in the N-terminal region; and orexin-B is a linear 28-residue peptide. These peptides have 46% identity at the amino acid sequence level, and show some similarity to the glucagon/vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/secretin peptide family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037824" "Orexin"}, "panther" {"PTHR15173" "OREXIN"}, "pfam" {"PF02072" "Prepro-orexin"}, "prints" {"PR01091" "OREXINPP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prepro-orexin", "short" "Orexin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 542, "taxa" 1951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 718, "sets" 0, "proteins" 717, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 532}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001704", :literature {"PUB00004929" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Date Y" "Ueta Y" "Yamashita H" "Yamaguchi H" "Matsukura S" "Kangawa K" "Sakurai T" "Yanagisawa M" "Nakazato M."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
