{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This narrowly distributed protein family contains an N-terminal radical SAM domain. It occurs in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, Ralstonia solanacearum, and numerous species and strains of Burkholderia. Members always occur next to a trio of three mutually homologous genes, all of which contain the domain [pfam:PF08898] as the whole of the protein (about 60 amino acids) or as the C-terminal domain. The function is unknown, but the fact that all phylogenetically correlated proteins are mutually homologous with prominent invariant motifs (an invariant tyrosine and a GDL motif) and as small as 60 amino acids suggests that post-translational modification of [pfam:PF08898] domain-containing proteins may be its function. This view is supported by closer homology to the PqqE radical SAM protein involved in PQQ biosynthesis from the PqqA precursor peptide than to other characterised radical SAM proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03913" "GDL motif peptide-associated radical SAM/SPASM maturase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radical SAM GDL-associated", "short" "rSAM_GDL-assoc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 261, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 198, "sets" 0, "proteins" 198, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 150}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0920", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0920"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023820", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023820", "name" "Radical SAM GDL-associated", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
