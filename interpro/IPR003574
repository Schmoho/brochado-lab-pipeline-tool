{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents interleukin-6 (IL6), also refered to as B-cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2) and interferon beta-2, it is a cytokine involved in a wide variety of biological functions [[cite:PUB00003997]]. It plays an essential role in the final differentiation of B-cells into IG-secreting cells, as well as inducing myeloma/plasmacytoma growth, nerve cell differentiation and, in hepatocytes, acute phase reactants [[cite:PUB00003997], [cite:PUB00001608]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the interleukin-6 homologue from human herpesvirus 8 type P which binds to interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta IL6ST and initiates a signal transduction. It is able to induce blood to lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation and, in infected primary effusion lymphoma cells, it promotes cell proliferation, protects them from apoptosis, and promotes immune evasion of interferon activity [[cite:PUB00153102]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1alu", "name" "HUMAN INTERLEUKIN-6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48494" "INTERLEUKIN-6"}, "pfam" {"PF00489" "Interleukin-6/G-CSF/MGF family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-6-like", "short" "IL-6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 597, "taxa" 2126, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1134, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1112, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 832}, "pathways" 29}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003574", :literature {"PUB00003997" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6092", "authors" ["Hirano T" "Yasukawa K" "Harada H" "Taga T" "Watanabe Y" "Matsuda T" "Kashiwamura S" "Nakajima K" "Koyama K" "Iwamatsu A."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/324073a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Complementary DNA for a novel human interleukin (BSF-2) that induces B lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin.", "year" 1986, "raw_pages" "73-6", "volume" "324", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3491322}, "PUB00001608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lutticken C" "Kruttgen A" "Moller C" "Heinrich PC" "Rose-John S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(91)80491-K", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Evidence for the importance of a positive charge and an alpha-helical structure of the C-terminus for biological activity of human IL-6.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "265-7", "volume" "282", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2037043}, "PUB00153102" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Morris VA" "Punjabi AS" "Wells RC" "Wittkopp CJ" "Vart R" "Lagunoff M."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.03.013", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "The KSHV viral IL-6 homolog is sufficient to induce blood to lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "112-20", "volume" "428", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22521915}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005138", "name" "interleukin-6 receptor binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030154", "name" "cell differentiation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005615", "name" "extracellular space", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030474", "name" "Interleukin-6/GCSF/MGF", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003574", "name" "Interleukin-6-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR040117", "name" "GCSF/MGF", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 741}}}
