{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fructose-1,6-bisphophatase (FBPase) catalyses the hydrolysis of D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to D-fructose-6-phopshate (F6P) and orthophosphate, and is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis [[cite:PUB00020983]]. Three different groups of FBPases have been identified in eukaryotes and bacteria (FBPase I-III) [[cite:PUB00016008]]. None of these groups have been found in archaea so far, though a new group of FBPases (FBPase IV) which also show inositol monophosphatase activity has recently been identified in archaea [[cite:PUB00020984]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry are though to represent a new group of FBPases (FBPase V) which are found in thermophilic archaea and a hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus [[cite:PUB00020985]]. The characterised members of this group show strict substrate specificity for FBP and are suggested to be the true FBPase in these organisms [[cite:PUB00020985], [cite:PUB00020986]]. A structural study suggests that FBPase V has a novel fold for a sugar phosphatase, forming a four-layer α-β-β-α sandwich, unlike the more usual five-layered α-β-α-β-α arrangement [[cite:PUB00020986]]. The arrangement of the catalytic side chains and metal ligands was found to be consistent with the three-metal ion assisted catalysis mechanism proposed for other FBPases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1umg", "name" "Crystal structure of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036076", "name" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, class V superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041126" "fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase"}, "hamap" {"MF_02067" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase [fbp]"}, "panther" {"PTHR38341" "FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE/PHOSPHATASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01950" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015647" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, archaeal type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, class V", "short" "FBPase_V"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 265, "taxa" 2376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3045, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2988, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2500}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
