{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>exchange proteins are involved in maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup>homeostasis in a wide variety of cell types. They are found in both the plasma membrane and intracellular organellar membranes, where they exchange Na<sup>+</sup>for Ca<sup>2+</sup>in an electrogenic manner. When located in the plasma membrane, they generally utilise the transmembrane (TM) Na<sup>+</sup>concentration gradient in order to extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup>from cells. Three mammalian isoforms have been cloned to date (NCX1-3), which consist of 920-970 amino acid residues that are predicted to possess 11 or 12 TM domains. Interestingly, they possess a short motif (~30 residues) that is similar to the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, although its function is unknown [[cite:PUB00005133], [cite:PUB00002973]].</p>\n\n<p>NCX1 is the principal Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>exchanger of cardiac myocytes, where it is thought to play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. It is also found in a variety of other tissues, suggesting it serves as a housekeeping protein, maintaining low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentration. Alternatively spliced variants of NCX1 have been identified, expression of which is cell type-specific. Sequence analysis reveals two sets of tandem repeats are found within the NCX1 protein sequence, which are usually referred to as alpha and beta. The alpha repeats are thought to be involved in the ion binding and translocation reactions of the exchanger, and the first beta repeat may be part of a regulatory site that responds to Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentration.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038081", "name" "CalX-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01260" "NACAEXCHNGR1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sodium/calcium exchanger, isoform 1", "short" "NaCa_exhngr1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 257, "taxa" 903, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3324, "sets" 0, "proteins" 870, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 526}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002987", :literature {"PUB00005133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4980", "authors" ["Nicoll DA" "Longoni S" "Philipson KD."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/250/4980/562", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Molecular cloning and functional expression of the cardiac sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "562-5", "volume" "250", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1700476}, "PUB00002973" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Nicoll DA" "Quednau BD" "Qui Z" "Xia YR" "Lusis AJ" "Philipson KD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
