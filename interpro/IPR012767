{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family describes the enzyme TreY. Maltooligosyl trehalose synthase (MTSase, TreY) and maltooligosyl trehalose trehalohydrolase (MTHase, TreZ) work together to produce trehalose. MTSase is responsible for converting the alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage to an alpha,alpha-1,1-glucosidic linkage at the reducing end of the maltooligosaccharide through an intramolecular transglucosylation reaction, while MTHase hydrolyzes the penultimate alpha-1,4 linkage of the reducing end, resulting in the release of trehalose [[cite:PUB00080592]]. The TreYZ pathway of trehalose biosynthesis is an alternative to the OtsAB pathway that generates trehalose from glucose and glucose-6-phosphate [[cite:PUB00080591]]. Trehalose may be incorporated into more complex compounds but is best known as compatible solute. It is one of the most effective osmoprotectants, and unlike the various betaines does not require nitrogen for its synthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hje", "name" "Crystal structure of sulfolobus tokodaii hypothetical maltooligosyl trehalose synthase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013797", "name" "Maltooligosyl trehalose synthase, domain 4", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11336" "Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in maltooligosyl trehalose synthase (MTSase)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02401" "malto-oligosyltrehalose synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Maltooligosyl trehalose synthase", "short" "Trehalose_TreY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2693, "taxa" 10252, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10191, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10191, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7481}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0266", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0266"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
