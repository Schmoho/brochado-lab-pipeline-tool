{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists mostly of uncharacterised proteins found in a number of bacterial species, including Streptomyces, Xanthomonas, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, Caulobacter crescentus CB15, and Xylella fastidiosa. One protein in this entry ([swissprot:P00947] from Comamonas testosteroni) has been shown to be a steroid delta-isomerase enzyme ([ec:5.3.3.1]). C. testosteroni is capable of growth on steroids as its sole source of carbon and this enzyme catalyses the isomerisation of a delta-5 steroid to a delta-4 form as shown below:\r\n\r\n<reaction>3-oxo-delta(5)-steroid ==  3-oxo-delta(4)-steroid</reaction>\r\n\r\nThis enzyme is one of the most efficient known, with a reaction rate equivalent to the diffusion-controlled limit [[cite:PUB00028107]]. It is a 28kDa homodimer whose crystal structure has been examined in detail [[cite:PUB00026137], [cite:PUB00023749], [cite:PUB00028108]]. Each monomer consists of three α-helices, a mixed β sheet, four turns, and two β-bulges. The β sheet forms a deep hydrophobic cavity with the active site residues near the base.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rob", "name" "The crystal structure of a conserved protein from Planctomyces limnophilus DSM 3776"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032710", "name" "NTF2-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02246" "SgcJ/EcaC family oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Steroid delta5-4-isomerase", "short" "Steroid_delta5-4_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2212, "taxa" 9272, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12149, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8943}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
