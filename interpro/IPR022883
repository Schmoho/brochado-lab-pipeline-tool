{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ArnE, which is an integral membrane component of the ArnE/ArnF (heterodimer) undecaprenyl-phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N flippase. The ArnE/ArnF undecaprenyl-phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N flippase is responsible for transporting undecaprenyl-phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N from the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ArnE and ArnF are both predicted to be integral membrane proteins with 4 transmembrane helices and belong to the drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) superfamily [[cite:PUB00053903]].\r\n\r\nDeletion of arnE or arnF results in restoration of polymyxin sensitivity in a polymyxin-resitant pmrAc strain and are defective for transfer of undecaprenyl-phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N from the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane to the periplasmic face and for attachment of L-Ara4N to lipid A. Both ArnE and ArnF are required for polymyxin resistance as expression from a plasmid of one cannot replace a deletion of the other [[cite:PUB00053903]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01869" "Probable 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose-phosphoundecaprenol flippase subunit ArnE [arnE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose-phosphoundecaprenol flippase, subunit ArnE", "short" "Flippase_ArnE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 106, "taxa" 1367, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1595, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1595, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1241}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022883", :literature {"PUB00053903" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["Yan A" "Guan Z" "Raetz CR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
