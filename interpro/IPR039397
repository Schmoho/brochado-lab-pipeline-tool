{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RagA and RagB are closely related Rag GTPases (ras-related GTP-binding protein A and B) that constitute a unique subgroup of the Ras superfamily [[cite:PUB00089588]], and are functional homologues of<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>Gtr1 [[cite:PUB00089594]]. They function by forming heterodimers with RagC or RagD, and similarly, Gtr1 dimerizes with Gtr2, through the carboxy-terminal segments. They play an essential role in regulating amino acid-induced target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) kinase signaling [[cite:PUB00089593]], exocytic cargo sorting at endosomes, and epigenetic control of gene expression. In response to amino acids, the Rag GTPases guide the TORC1 complex to activate the platform containing Rheb proto-oncogene by driving the relocalization of mTORC1 from discrete locations in the cytoplasm to a late endosomal and/or lysosomal compartment that is Rheb-enriched and contains Rab-7 [[cite:PUB00060388]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11384" "Rag GTPase, subfamily of Ras-related GTPases, includes Ras-related GTP-binding proteins A and B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RagA/B", "short" "RagA/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2048, "taxa" 6934, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3370, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2246}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2032", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2032"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
