{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are the intermembrane phospholipid transport system binding protein MlaD (maintenance of Lipid Asymmetry D) of an ABC transport system that removes phospholipid from the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane (OM), leaving only lipopolysaccharide in the outer leaflet. The Mla locus has long been associated with toluene tolerance, consistent with the proposed role in retrograde transport of phospholipid and therefore with maintaining the integrity of the OM as a protective barrier [[cite:PUB00059298]].  MlaD forms extremely stable hexamers within the complex, functions in substrate binding with strong affinity for phospholipids, and modulates ATP hydrolytic activity [[cite:PUB00086590]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04430" "outer membrane lipid asymmetry maintenance protein MlaD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable phospholipid ABC transporter-binding protein MlaD", "short" "ABC_MlaD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2247, "taxa" 9831, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10049, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10025, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7781}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030970", :literature {"PUB00059298" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Malinverni JC" "Silhavy TJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
