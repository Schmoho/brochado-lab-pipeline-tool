{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a group of membrane-shaping proteins that can promote local membrane curvatures, termed N-Ank proteins, which use their ankyrin repeat array and an N-terminal amphipathic helix to bind and shape membranes. The N-Ank superfamily can be divided in two subfamilies, the smaller one contains ankycorbin (also known as RAI14), UACA, Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 24 and 35 (Ankrd24/35); the larger second subfamily includes the uncharacterised proteins of the Ankrd18, Ankrd30 and Ankrd20 subfamilies, which all are specific to primates, or even to humans, as well as Ankrd7, Ankrd26, Ankrd36 and Ankrd62 [[cite:PUB00101483]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the smaller N-Ank subfamily. Ankycorbin is an actin binding protein that regulates F-actin dynamics [[cite:PUB00092970], [cite:PUB00092969]]. It plays an important role in early morphogenesis of neurons which depends on ankyrin repeat and N-terminal amphipathic helix. UACA (also known as Nucling) mediates apoptosis, regulates NF-κB and STAT3, sequesters par-4 and acts as an autoantigen in patients with panuveitis [[cite:PUB00101483], [cite:PUB00101482]]. Ankrd24 is a componement of the stereocilia rootlet in hair cells of inner ear. It bridges the apical plasma membrane with the lower rootlet and maintains normal distribution of TRIOBP, thereby reinforcing stereocilia insertion points and organising rootlets for hearing with long-term resilience [[cite:PUB00155139]]. ANKRD35 is associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia [[cite:PUB00101483]]. ANKRD35 interacts with E3 ligase RBCK1 and is part of the RBCK1-ANKRD35-MITD1-ANXA1 axis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) that regulates the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK and contributes to the dysregulation of sunitinib in ccRCC cells which constitutes a novel mechanism by which RBCK1 regulates sunitinib sensitivity in ccRCC [[cite:PUB00155140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24129" "ANKYCORBIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ankycorbin/UACA", "short" "RAI14/UACA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 641, "taxa" 2231, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4194, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1823}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042420", :literature {"PUB00101483" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Wolf D" "Hofbrucker-MacKenzie SA" "Izadi M" "Seemann E" "Steiniger F" "Schwintzer L" "Koch D" "Kessels MM" "Qualmann B."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "title" "Ankyrin repeat-containing N-Ank proteins shape cellular membranes.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1191-1205", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31548610}, "PUB00101482" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Dang HV" "Sakai T" "Pham TA" "Tran DH" "Yorita K" "Shishido Y" "Fukui K."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Nucling, a novel apoptosis-associated protein, controls mammary gland involution by regulating NF-κB and STAT3.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "24626-35", "volume" "290", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26269594}, "PUB00092970" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Peng YF" "Mandai K" "Sakisaka T" "Okabe N" "Yamamoto Y" "Yokoyama S" "Mizoguchi A" "Shiozaki H" "Monden M" "Takai Y."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Ankycorbin: a novel actin cytoskeleton-associated protein.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1001-8", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11168586}, "PUB00092969" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Qian X" "Mruk DD" "Cheng CY."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Rai14 (retinoic acid induced protein 14) is involved in regulating f-actin dynamics at the ectoplasmic specialization in the rat testis*.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e60656", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23565266}, "PUB00155139" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Krey JF" "Liu C" "Belyantseva IA" "Bateschell M" "Dumont RA" "Goldsmith J" "Chatterjee P" "Morrill RS" "Fedorov LM" "Foster S" "Kim J" "Nuttall AL" "Jones SM" "Choi D" "Friedman TB" "Ricci AJ" "Zhao B" "Barr-Gillespie PG."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202109134", "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "ANKRD24 organizes TRIOBP to reinforce stereocilia insertion points.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e202109134", "volume" "221", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35175278}, "PUB00155140" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Wang Y" "Peng M" "Zhong Y" "Xiong W" "Zhu L" "Jin X."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-023-02613-w", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "The E3 ligase RBCK1 reduces the sensitivity of ccRCC to sunitinib through the ANKRD35-MITD1-ANXA1 axis.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "952-966", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36732658}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003779", "name" "actin binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR042420", "name" "Ankycorbin/UACA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
