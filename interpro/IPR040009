{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Unlike mammalian mitochondrial DNAs, yeast mtDNAs have introns. S. pombe mtDNA contains only three introns: two in cox1 and one in cob1. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mtf2 (SPAC5D6.12) is required for cox1 gene expression. It shares very weak amino acid sequence similarity with S. cerevisiae Mtf2, and seems to have a more limited role than its S. cerevisiae counterpart, which is required for overall mitochondrial protein synthesis [[cite:PUB00090415]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39468" "CHROMOSOME 7, WHOLE GENOME SHOTGUN SEQUENCE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein Mtf2/C5D6.12-like", "short" "Mtf2/C5D6.12-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1014, "taxa" 2723, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1464, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1464, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 932}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040009", :literature {"PUB00090415" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Liu J" "Li Y" "Chen J" "Wang Y" "Zou M" "Su R" "Huang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.000602", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mtf2 is required for mitochondrial cox1 gene expression.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "400-409", "volume" "164", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29458562}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040009", "name" "Protein Mtf2/C5D6.12-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
