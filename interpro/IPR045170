PIPOX is involved in the lysine degradation pathway where it oxidizes L-pipecolate, a neuromodulator of the GABA receptor complex [[cite:PUB00098192]]. Peroxisomal DAAO degrades D-serine, a modulator of neurotransmission in the brain. DMGDH and SDH are flavoproteins which catalyse the oxidative demethylation of dimethyl glycine to sarcosine and sarcosine to glycine, respectively [[cite:PUB00049520]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1zov", "name" "Crystal Structure of Monomeric Sarcosine Oxidase from Bacillus sp.
