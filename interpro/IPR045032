{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pectate lyase [ec:4.2.2.2] is an enzyme involved in the maceration and soft rotting of plant tissue. Pectate lyase is responsible for the eliminative cleavage of pectate, yielding oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-D-mann-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. The protein is maximally expressed late in pollen development. It has been suggested that the pollen expression of pectate lyase genes might relate to a requirement for pectin degradation during pollen tube growth [[cite:PUB00004536]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure and the folding kinetics of one member of this family, pectate lyase C (pelC)1 from Erwinia chrysanthemi has been investigated in some detail [[cite:PUB00007170], [cite:PUB00005163]]. PelC contains a parallel β-helix folding motif. The majority of the regular secondary structure is composed of parallel β-sheets (about 30%). The individual strands of the sheets are connected by unordered loops of varying length. The backbone is then formed by a large helix composed of β-sheets. There are two disulphide bonds in pelC and 12 proline residues. One of these prolines, Pro220, is involved in a cis peptide bond. he folding mechanism of pelC involves two slow phases that have been attributed to proline isomerization.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pxz", "name" "1.7 Angstrom Crystal Structure of jun a 1, the major allergen from cedar pollen"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012334", "name" "Pectin lyase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011050", "name" "Pectin lyase fold/virulence factor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31683" "PECTATE LYASE 18-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pectin lyase family", "short" "PEL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 47, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1833, "taxa" 6820, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23260, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23260, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14735}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
