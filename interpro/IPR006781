{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Exchangeable apolipoproteins are water-soluble protein components of lipoproteins that solubilise lipids and regulate their metabolism by binding to cell receptors or activating specific enzymes. Apolipoprotein C-I (ApoC-1) is the smallest exchangeable apolipoprotein and transfers among HDL (high density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and chlylomicrons. ApoC-1 activates lecithin:choline acetyltransferase (LCAT), inhibits cholesteryl ester transfer protein, can inhibit hepatic lipase and phospholipase 2 and can stimulate cell growth. ApoC-1 delays the clearance of beta-VLDL by inhibiting its uptake via the LDL receptor-related pathway [[cite:PUB00008547]]. ApoC-1 has been implicated in hypertriglyceridemia [[cite:PUB00008548]], and Alzheimer s disease [[cite:PUB00008549]].</p>\n\n<p>ApoC-1 is believed to comprise of two dynamic helices that are stabilised by interhelical interactions and are connected by a short linker region. The minimal folding unit in the lipid-free state of this and other exchangeable apolipoproteins comprises the helix-turn-helix motif formed of four 11-mer sequence repeats.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6dvu", "name" "Structure of the Monoclinic-1 (Monocl-1) Crystal Form of Human Apolipoprotein C1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043081", "name" "Apolipoprotein C-I domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04691" "Apolipoprotein C-I (ApoC-1)"}, "panther" {"PTHR16565" "APOLIPOPROTEIN C-I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apolipoprotein C-I", "short" "ApoC-I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 193, "taxa" 968, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 426, "sets" 0, "proteins" 425, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 276}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006781", :literature {"PUB00008547" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Gursky O."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi0111505", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Solution conformation of human apolipoprotein C-1 inferred from proline mutagenesis: far- and near-UV CD study.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "12178-85", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11580293}, "PUB00008548" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Shachter NS."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
