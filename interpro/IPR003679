{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of bacterial aminoglycoside N(3)-acetyltransferases ([ec:2.3.1.81]) that catalyse the reaction [[cite:PUB00008152]]:<reaction>Acetyl-Co + a 2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic = CoA + N3'-acetyl-2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic</reaction>. The enzyme can use a range of antibiotics with 2-deoxystreptamine rings as acceptor for its acetyltransferase activity, this inactivates and confers resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, neomycin and apramycin amongst others. For the kanamycin group antibiotics acetylation occurred at the 3\"-amino group in arbekacin and amikacin, and at the 3-amino group in dibekacin as in the case of kanamycin reflecting the effect of the (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryl side chain which is present in arbekacin and amikacin, but absent in dibekacin and kanamycin [[cite:PUB00008153]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes CMP-5'-(N-hydroxy-3-aminopropyl)phosphonate acetyltransferase FrbF catalyzes acetyl transfer onto the hydroxamate of the FR-900098 precursors cytidine 5'-monophosphate-3-aminopropylphosphonate and cytidine 5'-monophosphate-N-hydroxy-3-aminopropylphosphonate [[cite:PUB00065632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6np3", "name" "AAC-VIa bound to Gentamicin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028345", "name" "Aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11104" "AMINOGLYCOSIDE N3-ACETYLTRANSFERASE"}, "pfam" {"PF02522" "Aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminoglycoside N(3)-acetyltransferase-like", "short" "Amioglycoside_AcTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 49, "domain_architectures" 53, "proteomes" 1391, "taxa" 6660, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7502, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7463, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5391}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
