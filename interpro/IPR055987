{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small family of uncharacterised proteins found in archaea and eukaryotes. These proteins contain two pairs of conserved cysteines and two pairs of conserved histidines that are probably involved in zinc coordination. These proteins likely resemble two classical C2H2 zinc fingers that pack on each other and form a compact globular structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24446" "Family of unknown function (DUF7565)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7565", "short" "DUF7565"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 158, "taxa" 762, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 488, "sets" 0, "proteins" 486, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 392}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055987", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055987", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7565", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 55, "alignment:full" 175}}}
