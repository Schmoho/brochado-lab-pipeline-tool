{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry possess the radical SAM domain. Included in this entry are the uncharacterised proteins MJ0683 (from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii), MT2655 and Rv2578c (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Mb2609c (from Mycobacterium bovis) and ORF301 (from Acidianus two-tailed virus). Also included in this entry is the radical SAM Nalpha-GlyT isomerase from Pseudomonas phage M6 which isomerizes 5-N-alpha-glycinylthymidine (Nalpha-GlyT) into 5-Calpha-glycinylthymidine (Calpha-GlyT) as a step in the pathway leading to thymidine hypermodifications in the viral genome; these modifications may prevent degradation of viral genome by the host restriction-modification antiviral defense system [[cite:PUB00101063]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01084" "Uncharacterised Radical SAM Subgroup 2"}, "panther" {"PTHR43432" "SLR0285 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein MJ0683-like", "short" "MJ0683-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4980, "taxa" 18878, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23356, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23349, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18148}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040086", :literature {"PUB00101063" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lee YJ" "Dai N" "Muller SI" "Guan C" "Parker MJ" "Fraser ME" "Walsh SE" "Sridar J" "Mulholland A" "Nayak K" "Sun Z" "Lin YC" "Comb DG" "Marks K" "Gonzalez R" "Dowling DP" "Bandarian V" "Saleh L" "Correa IR" "Weigele PR."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Pathways of thymidine hypermodification.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "3001-3017", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34522950}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040086", "name" "Protein MJ0683-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR031012", "name" "Radical SAM mobile pair protein B", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
