{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) ([ec:1.11.1.9]) is an enzyme that catalyses the reduction of hydroperoxides by glutathione [[cite:PUB00003890]]. Its main function is to protect against the damaging effect of endogenously formed hydroperoxides. In higher vertebrates, several forms of GSHPx are known, including a ubiquitous cytosolic form (GSHPx-1), a gastrointestinal cytosolic form (GSHPx-GI), a plasma secreted form (GSHPx-P), and an epididymal secretory form (GSHPx-EP). In mammals there are eight GPx, divided in two clusters, the classical GPx (GPx1, GPx2, GPx3, GPx5 and GPx6) and phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (GPx4, GPx7 and GPx8). The classical GPx is multimeric (commonly tetrameric) and soluble, while the phospholipid hydroperoxide (PHGPx) is monomeric and often membrane-associated [[cite:PUB00095067]]. In addition to these characterised forms, the sequence of a protein of unknown function [[cite:PUB00004364]] has been shown to be evolutionary related to those of GSHPx's.</p>\n\n<p>In filarial nematode parasites, the major soluble cuticular protein (gp29) is a secreted GSHPx, which may provide a mechanism of resistance to the immune reaction of the mammalian host by neutralising the products of the oxidative burst of leukocytes [[cite:PUB00004788]]. The structure of bovine seleno-glutathione peroxidase has been determined [[cite:PUB00001337]]. The protein belongs to the α-β class, with a three layer(aba) sandwich architecture. The catalytic site of GSHPx contains a conserved residue which is either a cysteine or, in many eukaryotic GSHPx, a selenocysteine [[cite:PUB00000070]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v1m", "name" "Crystal structure of Schistosoma mansoni glutathione peroxidase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11592" "GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE"}, "cdd" {"cd00340" "GSH_Peroxidase"}, "profile" {"PS51355" "Glutathione peroxidase profile"}, "pfam" {"PF00255" "Glutathione peroxidase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000303" "Glutathione peroxidase"}, "prints" {"PR01011" "GLUTPROXDASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutathione peroxidase", "short" "Glutathione_peroxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 212, "proteomes" 8611, "taxa" 31851, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49076, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48944, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34988}, "pathways" 53}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00396", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00396"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0213", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0213"} {"accession" "GenProp1721", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1721"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
