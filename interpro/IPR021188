{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In prokaryotes, the major role of DNA methylation is to protect host DNA against degradation by restriction enzymes. There are 2 major classes of DNA methyltransferase that differ in the nature of the modifications they effect. The members of one class (C-MTases) methylate a ring carbon and form C5-methylcytosine (see PRINTS signature C5METTRFRASE). Members of the second class (N-MTases) methylate exocyclic nitrogens and form either N4-methylcytosine (N4-MTases) or N6-methyladenine (N6-MTases). Both classes of MTase utilise the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and are active as monomeric enzymes [[cite:PUB00000092]].</p>\n\n<p>N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylases ([ec:2.1.1.72]) (A-Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA. Such enzymes are found in the three existing types of bacterial` restriction-modification systems (in type I system the A-Mtase is the product of the hsdM gene, and in type III it is the product of the mod gene). All of these enzymes recognise a specific sequence in DNA and methylate an adenine in that sequence. It has been shown [[cite:PUB00003225], [cite:PUB00001770], [cite:PUB00003245], [cite:PUB00001857]] that A-Mtases contain a conserved motif Asp/Asn-Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe in their N-terminal section, this conserved region could be involved in substrate binding or in the catalytic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>N6-MTase TaqI recognises the double-stranded sequence TCGA, causing specific methylation on A-4 on both strands which protects the DNA from cleavage by the TaqI endonuclease [[cite:PUB00054009]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ih2", "name" "Crystal structure of the adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase M.TaqI complexed with the cofactor analog AETA and a 10 bp DNA containing 5-methylpyrimidin-2(1H)-one at the target base partner position"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037236" "Adenine-DNA-methyltransferase TaqI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N6 adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase, TaqI class", "short" "N6_DNA_MeTrfase_TaqI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 35, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
