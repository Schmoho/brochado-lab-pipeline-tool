{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) was first discovered based on its similarity to complex I in respiratory electron transport. However, it seems to be a ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reductase rather than an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Furthermore, it also comprises a subcomplex on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and a lumenal subcomplex [[cite:PUB00083364]].  The chloroplast NDH complex has been divided into four categories: membrane, lumen, A, and B subcomplexes. The subcomplex A and membrane subcomplex are conserved in cyanobacteria, but the subcomplex B and lumen subcomplex are specific to chloroplasts. PNSB4/NDF6 is a subunit of subcomplex B [[cite:PUB00083730]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36315" "PHOTOSYNTHETIC NDH SUBUNIT OF SUBCOMPLEX B 4, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosynthetic NDH subunit of subcomplex B 4, chloroplastic", "short" "PNSB4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 228, "taxa" 948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 323}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034570", :literature {"PUB00083364" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Ifuku K" "Endo T" "Shikanai T" "Aro EM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcr098", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "Structure of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex: nomenclature for nuclear-encoded subunits.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1560-8", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21785130}, "PUB00083730" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Ishikawa N" "Takabayashi A" "Ishida S" "Hano Y" "Endo T" "Sato F."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcn083", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "NDF6: a thylakoid protein specific to terrestrial plants is essential for activity of chloroplastic NAD(P)H dehydrogenase in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1066-73", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18535009}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009773", "name" "photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009535", "name" "chloroplast thylakoid membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0010598", "name" "NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (plastoquinone)", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034570", "name" "Photosynthetic NDH subunit of subcomplex B 4, chloroplastic", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
