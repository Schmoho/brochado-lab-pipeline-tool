{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UL16 protein (also known as cytoplasmic envelopment protein 2) plays a role in capsid maturation including DNA packaging/cleavage [[cite:PUB00007465]]. In immunofluorescence studies [[cite:PUB00007466]], UL16 was localised to the nucleus of infected cells in areas containing high concentrations of Human herpesvirus 2 (Herpes simplex virus 2) capsid proteins. These nuclear compartments have been described previously as viral assemblons [[cite:PUB00007467]] and are distinct from compartments containing replicating DNA. Localization within assemblons argues for a role of UL16 encoded protein in capsid assembly or maturation [[cite:PUB00007466]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UL94 is a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) homologue that has been shown to be involved in facilitating secondary envelopment of virions [[cite:PUB00082621]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04039" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 2"}, "pfam" {"PF03044" "Herpesvirus UL16/UL94 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL16/UL94", "short" "Herpes_UL16/UL94"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 76, "taxa" 367, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 527, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004286", :literature {"PUB00007465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Oshima S" "Daikoku T" "Shibata S" "Yamada H" "Goshima F" "Nishiyama Y."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
