{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Haloacid Dehydrogenase (HAD) superfamily includes phosphatases, phosphonatases, P-type ATPases, beta-phosphoglucomutases, phosphomannomutases, and dehalogenases, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes ranging from amino acid biosynthesis to detoxification [[cite:PUB00003337]]. Proteins in this entry are mostly uncharacterised, though they form a distinct subgroup within the HAD superfamily. Members are found almost exclusively in bacteria and many species contain several paralogs, for example Escherichia coli contains a total of six proteins from this entry. Sequence similarities suggest that these enzymes are phosphatases which work on phosphorylated sugars.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a family belonging to the HAD superfamily. It is named after E. coli Cof and is notable for the large number of paralogues in many species. Cof is a phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of HMP-PP (4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate) to HMP-P (4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate) [[cite:PUB00053972]].</p>\n\n<p>E. coli YbiV ([swissprot:P75792]) also belongs to this group and has been experimentally characterised [[cite:PUB00028115]]. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of sugar phosphate to sugar and inorganic phosphate. It has a wide substrate specificity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of ribose-5-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate most efficiently, but it is not known if these are the real substrates in vivo. The protein appears to be a monomer that contains two domains, an α-β hydrolase domain that forms a Rossman fold, and an α-β domain. The active site is found in a negatively charged cavity found at the interface between the two domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1nrw", "name" "The structure of a HALOACID DEHALOGENASE-LIKE HYDROLASE FROM B.
