{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lactotransferrin or lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron binding glycoprotein that exists in body secretions as a line of natural defence and plays an important role in defence against pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. It has multiple activities ranging from the intestinal iron absorption, intestinal cell growth, regulation of myelopoiesis and immune responses [[cite:PUB00073675]]. Bovine Lf also possesses potent anti-cancer activities [[cite:PUB00073676]].\r\nLf has been shown to be a serine peptidase [[cite:PUB00035540]] and belongs to MEROPS family S60.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1cb6", "name" "STRUCTURE OF HUMAN APOLACTOFERRIN AT 2.0 A RESOLUTION."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500683" "Lactoferrin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lactotransferrin", "short" "Lactotransferrin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 138, "sets" 0, "proteins" 111, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 86}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
