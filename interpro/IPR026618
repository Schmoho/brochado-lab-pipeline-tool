Its The subcellular location is regulated during cell cycle. During interphase, it is located in the nucleus. During mitosis, it is located at the centrosome and dispersed in the cytoplasm. During telophase, it is located in the midbody. It colocalizes with PLK1 at the centrosome in M phase [[cite:PUB00060829], [cite:PUB00060830]]. It is phosphorylated during mitosis in the cell cycle probably by CDK1 [[cite:PUB00060690], [cite:PUB00060831]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22446" "M-PHASE-SPECIFIC PLK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "M-phase-specific PLK1-interacting protein-like, vertebrate", "short" "MPLKIP-like_vertebrate"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 459, "taxa" 1533, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 564, "sets" 0, "proteins" 564, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 403}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026618", :literature {"PUB00060829" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Tian Y" "Chen Q" "Chen D" "Zhai Z" "Shu HB."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
