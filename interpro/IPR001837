{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs) are highly conserved actin-binding proteins present in a wide range of organisms including yeast, fly, plants, and mammals. CAPs are multifunctional proteins that contain several structural domains. CAP is involved in species-specific signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00042568], [cite:PUB00042569], [cite:PUB00042570], [cite:PUB00007159]]. In Drosophila, CAP functions in Hedgehog-mediated eye development and in establishing oocyte polarity. In Dictyostelium (slim mold), CAP is involved in microfilament reorganisation near the plasma membrane in a PIP2-regulated manner and is required to perpetuate the cAMP relay signal to organise fruitbody formation. In plants, CAP is involved in plant signalling pathways required for co-ordinated organ expansion. In yeast, CAP is involved in adenylate cyclase activation, as well as in vesicle trafficking and endocytosis. In both yeast and mammals, CAPs appear to be involved in recycling G-actin monomers from ADF/cofilins for subsequent rounds of filament assembly [[cite:PUB00042579], [cite:PUB00042580]]. In mammals, there are two different CAPs (CAP1 and CAP2) that share 64% amino acid identity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents CAP proteins from various organisms.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1s0p", "name" "Structure of the N-Terminal Domain of the Adenylyl Cyclase-Associated Protein (CAP) from Dictyostelium discoideum."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036222", "name" "Adenylate cyclase-associated CAP, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10652" "ADENYLYL CYCLASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylate cyclase-associated CAP", "short" "Adenylate_cyclase-assoc_CAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2624, "taxa" 8979, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6880, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6880, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4473}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00835", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00835"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001837", :literature {"PUB00042579" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 7", "authors" ["Bertling E" "Quintero-Monzon O" "Mattila PK" "Goode BL" "Lappalainen P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
