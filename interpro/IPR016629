{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit A (TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFI48 or TAF1A) of RNA polymerase I. It is a component of the transcription factor SL1/TIFIB complex involved in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The SL1/TIFIB complex is composed of TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TAF1A (TAFI48), TAF1B (TAFI63) and TAF1C (TAFI110) [[cite:PUB00088436]].</p>\n\n<p>Human ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I requires the activator UBF and the promoter selectivity factor SL1/TIFIB. Both TAF1B/TAFI63 and TAF1C/TAFI110 contact the promoter, whereas TAF1A/TAFI48 serves as a target for interaction with UBF and is required to form a transcriptionally active SL1/TIFIB complex responsive to UBF [[cite:PUB00042709]]. Interaction of the SL1/TIFIB subunits with TBP excluded interaction with the transcription factor IID (TFIID) subunits [[cite:PUB00042708]]. This mutually exclusive binding directs the formation of promoter- and RNA polymerase-selective TBP-TAF complexes. Therefore, TAF1A/TAFI48 may function both as a target to mediate UBF activation and as a class-specific promoter selectivity factor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015161" "RNA polymerase I, subunit A (TATA-binding protein-associated factor)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TATA box-binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase I subunit A, chordata", "short" "RNA_pol_I_TAF1A/TAFI48_chr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 77, "taxa" 326, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 113, "sets" 0, "proteins" 112, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 79}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016629", :literature {"PUB00042708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Gorski JJ" "Pathak S" "Panov K" "Kasciukovic T" "Panova T" "Russell J" "Zomerdijk JC."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601601", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "A novel TBP-associated factor of SL1 functions in RNA polymerase I transcription.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1560-8", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17318177}, "PUB00042709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5241", "authors" ["Beckmann H" "Chen JL" "O'Brien T" "Tjian R."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/270/5241/1506", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Coactivator and promoter-selective properties of RNA polymerase I TAFs.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "1506-9", "volume" "270", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7491500}, "PUB00088436" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Friedrich JK" "Panov KI" "Cabart P" "Russell J" "Zomerdijk JC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
