{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represent GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, also known as GDP-D-mannose dehydratase. This enzyme converts GDP-mannose to GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose, the first of three steps for the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose in animals, plants, and bacteria. In bacteria, GDP-L-fucose acts as a precursor of surface antigens such as the extracellular polysaccharide colanic acid of Escherichia coli. Excluded from this family are members of the clade that are poorly related because of highly dervied (phylogenetically long-branch) sequences, e.g. Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus Gmd, described as a bifunctional GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase/GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase [[cite:PUB00009601]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6gpl", "name" "Crystal structure of human GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase in complex with GDP-4k6d-Man"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00955" "GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase [gmd]"}, "panther" {"PTHR43715" "GDP-MANNOSE 4,6-DEHYDRATASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01472" "GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase", "short" "GDP_Man_deHydtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5685, "taxa" 24826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30395, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30392, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22900}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1429", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1429"} {"accession" "GenProp1648", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1648"} {"accession" "GenProp0930", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0930"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
