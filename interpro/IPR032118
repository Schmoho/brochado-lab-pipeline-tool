{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of small hydrophobic phage proteins called holins with one transmembrane domain. Holins are produced by double-stranded DNA bacteriophages that use an endolysin-holin strategy to achieve lysis of their hosts. The endolysins are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that are usually accumulated in the cytosol until access to the cell wall substrate is provided by the holin membrane lesion [[cite:PUB00076207], [cite:PUB00076208]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16080" "Bacteriophage holin family HP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage holin HP1 family", "short" "Phage_holin_HP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 159, "taxa" 1259, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1590, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1590, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1151}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032118", :literature {"PUB00076207" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Esposito D" "Fitzmaurice WP" "Benjamin RC" "Goodman SD" "Waldman AS" "Scocca JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/24.12.2360", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage HP1 DNA.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "2360-8", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8710508}, "PUB00076208" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Pontarollo RA" "Rioux CR" "Potter AA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
