{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>There are two types of fatty acid synthase systems. The type I system is found in metazoans and is carried out by a multifunctional polypeptide with multiple active sites. In contrast, the type II system found in bacteria and plants consists of a set of discrete monofunctional proteins, each encoded by a separate gene. ACP1 is central to both of these pathways because it functions to ferry the pathway intermediates between active site centres or enzymes. ACPs are also critical to the function of other metabolic pathways such as polyketide synthases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1l0i", "name" "Crystal structure of butyryl-ACP I62M mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036736", "name" "ACP-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01217" "Acyl carrier protein [acpP]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00517" "acyl carrier protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR20863" "ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl carrier protein", "short" "ACP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 442, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11433, "taxa" 43561, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57235, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57219, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 43259}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1104", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1104"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003231", :literature {"PUB00028023" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Parris KD" "Lin L" "Tam A" "Mathew R" "Hixon J" "Stahl M" "Fritz CC" "Seehra J" "Somers WS."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00178-7", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structures of substrate binding to Bacillus subtilis holo-(acyl carrier protein) synthase reveal a novel trimeric arrangement of molecules resulting in three active sites.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "883-95", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10997907}, "PUB00028024" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["Findlow SC" "Winsor C" "Simpson TJ" "Crosby J" "Crump MP."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi0342259", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Solution structure and dynamics of oxytetracycline polyketide synthase acyl carrier protein from Streptomyces rimosus.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "8423-33", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12859187}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006633", "name" "fatty acid biosynthetic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003231", "name" "Acyl carrier protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044813", "name" "Acyl carrier protein, chloroplastic", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
