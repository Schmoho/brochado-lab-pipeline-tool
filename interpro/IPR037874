{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cdc42 is an essential GTPase that belongs to the Rho family of Ras-like GTPases. These proteins act as molecular switches by responding to exogenous and/or endogenous signals and relaying those signals to activate downstream components of a biological pathway. Cdc42 transduces signals to the actin cytoskeleton to initiate and maintain polarized growth and to mitogen-activated protein morphogenesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc42 plays an important role in multiple actin-dependent morphogenetic events such as bud emergence, mating-projection formation, and pseudohyphal growth [[cite:PUB00087769]]. In mammalian cells, Cdc42 regulates a variety of actin-dependent events and induces the JNK/SAPK protein kinase cascade, which leads to the activation of transcription factors within the nucleus [[cite:PUB00087768]]. Cdc42 mediates these processes through interactions with a myriad of downstream effectors, whose number and regulation we are just starting to understand. In addition, Cdc42 has been implicated in a number of human diseases through interactions with its regulators and downstream effectors [[cite:PUB00087770]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4js0", "name" "Complex of Cdc42 with the CRIB-PR domain of IRSp53"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01874" "cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) is a small GTPase of the Rho family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cdc42", "short" "Cdc42"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2004, "taxa" 6805, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3792, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3792, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2478}, "pathways" 237}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
