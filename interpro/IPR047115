{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) and its paralogues, ARSI and ARSJ. ARSB removes sulfate groups from chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and regulates its degradation [[cite:PUB00101969], [cite:PUB00085737]]. It is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell migration and invasion in colonic epithelium [[cite:PUB00101969]]. ARSI displays arylsulfatase activity at neutral pH, when co-expressed with SUMF1. Arylsulfatase activity has been detected in the secretion medium of retinal cell line, but no activity has been recorded when measured in cell extracts [[cite:PUB00101970], [cite:PUB00101971]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10342" "ARYLSULFATASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arylsulfatase B", "short" "ARSB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1087, "taxa" 5208, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8105, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5142}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
