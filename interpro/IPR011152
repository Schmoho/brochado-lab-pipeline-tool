Many members possess motifs characteristic of a variety of enzymatically active phosphoesterases [[cite:PUB00014394]], including acid and alkaline phosphatases, phosphoprotein phosphatases, 5'-nucleotidase, bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (symmetrical), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, 2',3'-cylic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase, and the 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase CpdA. In others, the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain is poorly conserved and residues thought to be essential are not preserved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2gju", "name" "Crystal structure of hypothetical protein PH1004 from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000883" "Predicted phosphoesterase, MJ0912 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoesterase MJ0912", "short" "Pesterase_MJ0912"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2547, "taxa" 11951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17422, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17258, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13176}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011152", :literature {"PUB00014394" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Klabunde T" "Strater N" "Frohlich R" "Witzel H" "Krebs B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
