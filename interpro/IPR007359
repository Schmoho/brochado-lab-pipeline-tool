{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This bacterial family of integral membrane proteins represents a positive regulator of the sigma(E) transcription factor, namely RseC/MucC. The sigma(E) transcription factor is up-regulated by cell envelope protein misfolding, and regulates the expression of genes that are collectively termed ECF (devoted to Extra-Cellular Functions) [[cite:PUB00009919]]. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, derepression of sigma(E) is associated with the alginate-overproducing phenotype characteristic of chronic respiratory tract colonization in cystic fibrosis patients. The mechanism by which RseC/MucC positively regulates the sigma(E) transcription factor is unknown. RseC is also thought to have a role in thiamine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium [[cite:PUB00009920]]. In addition, this family also includes an N-terminal part of RnfF, a Rhodobacter capsulatus protein, of unknown function, that is essential for nitrogen fixation. This protein also contains a domain found in ApbE protein [interpro:IPR003374].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35867" "PROTEIN RSEC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Positive regulator of sigma(E), RseC/MucC", "short" "SigmaE_reg_RseC_MucC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1340, "taxa" 6873, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5614}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007359", :literature {"PUB00009919" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Missiakas D" "Mayer MP" "Lemaire M" "Georgopoulos C" "Raina S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
