{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>D-alanine--D-alanine ligase ([ec:6.3.2.4]) is a bacterial enzyme involved in cell-wall biosynthesis. It participates in forming UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl pentapeptide, the peptidoglycan precursor. These enzymes are proteins of 300 to 360 amino acids containing many conserved regions. The N-terminal Gly-rich region could be involved in ATP-binding.</p>\n\n<p>This family of enzymes represent chromosomal versions of species not specifically resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin. The mechanism of glycopeptide antibiotic resistance involves the production of D-alanine-D-lactate (VanA and VanB families) or D-alanine-D-serine (VanC). This model attempts to exclude the VanA/VanB and VanC subfamilies while capturing most other D-Ala-D-Ala ligases above the trusted cut-off. However, changes in small numbers of amino acids, as demonstrated crystallographically, can alter specificity. In chlamydial species, this enzyme is found as a fusion protein with UDP-N-acetylmuramate--alanine ligase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6u1k", "name" "Thermus thermophilus D-alanine-D-alanine ligase in complex with ADP, carbonate, D-alanine-D-alanine, Mg2+ and K+"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF039102" "D-alanine--D-alanine ligase/D-alanine--D-lactate ligase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00047" "D-alanine--D-alanine ligase [ddl]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01205" "D-alanine--D-alanine ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-alanine--D-alanine ligase", "short" "D_ala_D_ala"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 66, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8808, "taxa" 34631, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 47347, "sets" 0, "proteins" 47293, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36432}, "pathways" 46}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1448", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1448"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
