{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes NAA60 from animals and MCC1 from Arabidopsis. NAA60 (also known as NatF) is an N-alpha-acetyltransferase that specifically mediates the acetylation of N-terminal residues of the transmembrane proteins, with a strong preference for N termini facing the cytosol. It is localized in the Golgi apparatus [[cite:PUB00098122]].
