{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dpl is a homologue related to the prion protein (PrP). Dpl is toxic to neurons and is expressed in the brains of mice that do not express PrP. In DHPC and SDS micelles, Dpl shoes about 40% α-helical structure however in aqueous solution it consists of a random coil. The α helical segment can adopt a transmembrane localisation also in a membrane. The unprocessed Dpl protein is thought to posses a possible channel formation mechanism which may be related to toxicity through direct interaction with cell membranes and damage to the cell membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11466" "Prion-like protein Doppel"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prion-like protein Doppel", "short" "Doppel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 507, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 243, "sets" 0, "proteins" 243, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 167}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021566", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021566", "name" "Prion-like protein Doppel", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 120}}}
