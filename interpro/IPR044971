{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of plant proteins, including Stress enhanced protein 2 (Sep2), which is related to the chlorophyll a/b-binding gene family members. Its transcript was present under low light conditions, but their level increased 4- to 10-fold during illumination of plants with high-intensity light [[cite:PUB00097644]]. It may be involved in non-photochemical quenching, a process that maintains the balance between dissipation and utilization of light energy to minimise generation of oxidising molecules, thereby protecting the plant against photo-oxidative damage.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36490" "STRESS ENHANCED PROTEIN 2, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stress enhanced protein 2, chloroplastic", "short" "SEP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 237, "taxa" 934, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 439, "sets" 0, "proteins" 439, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 251}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044971", :literature {"PUB00097644" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Heddad M" "Adamska I."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Light stress-regulated two-helix proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana related to the chlorophyll a/b-binding gene family.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "3741-6", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10725357}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0071486", "name" "cellular response to high light intensity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044971", "name" "Stress enhanced protein 2, chloroplastic", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
