{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the histidine kinase PdhS found in Brucella species. PdhS is a cytoplasmic histidine kinase essential for cell viability. It localises at the old pole of dividing cells and controls cell division and maturation, probably through control of DivK phosphorylation status and cellular distribution, which in turn regulates CtrA, a transcriptional regulator of the minB operon. The asymmetrical localisation of this protein is probably required for cells to enter a new division cycle [[cite:PUB00151385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041593" "cell-division control histidine kinase PdhS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell-division control histidine kinase PdhS", "short" "PdhS_histid_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 67, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50, "sets" 0, "proteins" 50, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 40}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
