{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from gammaproteobacteria, including ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase Tri1 from Pseudomonas putida, an immunity component of an interbacterial competition system (also called effector-immunity systems). Expression of Tri1 in E.coli neutralises the toxic effects of non-cognate S.proteamaculans effector protein Tre1 (Tre1-Sp) [[cite:PUB00100280]]. The structure of this complex revealed two distinct immunity mechanisms which concomitantly utilise active site occlusion to inactivate cognate effector proteins and a promiscuous ADP-ribosylhydrolase (ARH) activity to reverse ART-catalyzed modifications [pdbe:6DRE] [[cite:PUB00100280]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6dre", "name" "ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin/immunity pair"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036705", "name" "ADP-ribosylation/Crystallin J1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041672" "ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase Tri1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase Tri1-like", "short" "Tri1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 197, "sets" 0, "proteins" 197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 128}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
