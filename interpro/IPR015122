{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The phage-encoded excisionase protein Tn916-Xis adopts a winged-helix structure that consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet that packs against a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif and a third C-terminal α-helix. It is encoded for by Tn916, which also codes for the integrase Tn916-Int. The protein interacts with DNA by the insertion of helix α2 into the major groove and the contact of the hairpin that connects strands β2 and β3 with the adjacent phosphodiester backbone and/or minor groove. Tn916-Xis stimulates phage excision and inhibits viral integration by stabilising distorted DNA structures [[cite:PUB00032591]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038148", "name" "Transposon Tn1545/Tn916, excisionase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09035" "Excisionase from transposon Tn916"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004323" "Predicted transposon excisionase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Excisionase from transposon Tn916", "short" "Tn916-Xis"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 313, "taxa" 1436, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2549, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2548, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2072}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015122", :literature {"PUB00032591" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Abbani M" "Iwahara M" "Clubb RT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
