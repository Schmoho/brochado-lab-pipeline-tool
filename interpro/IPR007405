While the functions of these proteins are unknown, an analysis has suggested that they may form a novel family within the RNASE H-like superfamily [[cite:PUB00020735]]. These proteins appear to contain all the core secondary structural elements of the RNase H-like fold and share several conserved, possible active site, residues. It was suggested, therefore, that they function as nucleases. From the taxonomic distibution of these proteins it was further inferred that they may play a role in DNA repair under stressful conditions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39961" "HYPOTHETICAL CYTOSOLIC PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF04308" "Ribonuclease H-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage KVP40, Orf299", "short" "Phage_KVP40_Orf299"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 695, "taxa" 3224, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3340, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2538}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007405", :literature {"PUB00020735" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Knizewski L" "Ginalski K."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
