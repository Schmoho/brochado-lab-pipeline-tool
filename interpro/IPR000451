{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The transcription factor NF-kB (Nuclear Factor-kappaB) was first identified as a DNA-binding protein specific for the 10-base pair kB site in the immunoglobulin k light-chain enhancer of B lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00063589]], but has subsequently been found in many different cell types. NF-kB represents a group of structurally related proteins that share a 300 amino acid `Rel homology domain' (RHD) [[cite:PUB00000613]]: members include p50 (NF-kB1), p52 (NF-kB2), p65 (RelA), c-Rel, v-Rrel, RelB, and the Drosophila proteins Dorsal and Dif. These proteins exist as homo- and heterodimers that bind to kB sites in the enhancer regions of several target genes, most of which are involved in cellular defence mechanisms and differentiation.</p>\n\n<p>The RHD, which is located N-terminally, is responsible for protein dimerisation, DNA binding and nuclear localisation. The more variable C-terminal transactivation domain is found in RelA, RelB and c-Rel, but not in p50 or p52. Nevertheless, p50 and p52 play critical roles in modulating the specificity of NF-kB function. DNA binding requires the entire RHD, by contrast with other eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcription factors, where much smaller DNA-binding domains confer full specificity and binding affinity for the target [[cite:PUB00004200]]. The structure of the transcription factor NF-kB p50 homodimer bound to a palindromic kB site shows the RHD to fold into 2 distinct subdomains, similar to the β-sandwich structure of the immunoglobulins [[cite:PUB00004200]].</p>\n\n<p>NF-kB is expressed in the cytoplasm of virtually all cell types, where its activity is controlled by a family of regulatory proteins, called inhibitors of NF-kB (IkB) [[cite:PUB00073034], [cite:PUB00073035]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1my7", "name" "NF-kappaB p65 subunit dimerization domain homodimer N202R mutation"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24169" "NUCLEAR FACTOR NF-KAPPA-B PROTEIN"}, "prints" {"PR00057" "NFKBTNSCPFCT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NF-kappa-B/Dorsal", "short" "NFkB/Dor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 60, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 890, "taxa" 3853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 7831, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7344, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4608}, "pathways" 111}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00924", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00924"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000451", :literature {"PUB00073034" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Hayden MS" "Ghosh S."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1228704", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Signaling to NF-kappaB.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "2195-224", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15371334}, "PUB00073035" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hayden MS" "Ghosh S."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.183434.111", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "NF-κB, the first quarter-century: remarkable progress and outstanding questions.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "203-34", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22302935}, "PUB00004200" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6512", "authors" ["Ghosh G" "van Duyne G" "Ghosh S" "Sigler PB."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/373303a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of NF-kappa B p50 homodimer bound to a kappa B site.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "303-10", "volume" "373", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7530332}, "PUB00000613" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Baeuerle PA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
