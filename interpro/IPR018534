{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human colonic Bacteroides species harbour a family of large conjugative transposons, called tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements. Activities of these elements are enhanced by pregrowth of bacteria in medium containing tetracycline, indicating that at least some Tcr element genes are regulated by tetracycline. An insertional disruption in the rteC gene abolished self-transfer of the Tcr element to Bacteroides recipients, indicating that the gene was essential for self-transfer [[cite:PUB00044478]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09357" "RteC protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetracycline regulation of excision, RteC", "short" "Tet_reg_excision_RteC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 489, "taxa" 1855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4282, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4273, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3590}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018534", :literature {"PUB00044478" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Stevens AM" "Shoemaker NB" "Li LY" "Salyers AA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
