{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT or ADHFe1), also known as D-2-hydroxyglutarate transhydrogenase, catalyzes the conversion of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), coupled to the stoichiometric conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate in gamma-Hydroxybutyrate catabolism [[cite:PUB00092738], [cite:PUB00092740]]. Unlike many other alcohols, which are oxidized by NAD-linked dehydrogenases, gamma-hydroxybutyrate is metabolized to succinate semialdehyde by hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase which does not require free NAD or NADP, but instead using alpha-ketoglutarate as an acceptor, converting it to d-2-hydroxyglutarate. Alpha-ketoglutarate serves as an intermediate acceptor to regenerate NAD(P) required for the oxidation of GHB. HOT also catalyzes the reversible oxidation of a hydroxyacid obligatorily coupled to the reduction of an oxoacid, and requires no cofactor. In mammals, the HOT enzyme is located in mitochondria, and is expressed with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. HOT enzyme is member of the metal-containing alcohol dehydrogenase family. They typically contain an iron although other metal ions may be used [[cite:PUB00092741], [cite:PUB00092738]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08190" "Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) involved in gamma-hydroxybutyrate metabolism"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase", "short" "HOT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2318, "taxa" 8012, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4620, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3154}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
