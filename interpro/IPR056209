{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents adaptor proteins found in SU10-like bacteriophages and prophages. The dodecamer of SU10 adaptor proteins forms the interface between the dodecamer of portal proteins and hexamer of nozzle proteins [[cite:PUB00153713]]. The adaptor complex provides six attachment sites for long tail fibres, each of which is formed by a trimer of long tail fibre proximal proteins and a trimer of long tail fibre distal proteins. The adaptor protein of SU10 has the same domain organisation as those of phages T7 and KP32. Its structure consists of an α-helical bundle domain composed of intertwined N- and C-terminal helices; and a β-sandwich long tail fibre dock domain [[cite:PUB00153713]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24175" "SU10 adaptor protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SU10 adaptor protein", "short" "SU10_adaptor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 133, "taxa" 1158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 926, "sets" 0, "proteins" 901, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 492}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056209", :literature {"PUB00153713" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Siborova M" "Fuzik T" "Prochazkova M" "Novacek J" "Benesik M" "Nilsson AS" "Plevka P."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33305-w", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Tail proteins of phage SU10 reorganize into the nozzle for genome delivery.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "5622", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36153309}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056209", "name" "SU10 adaptor protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 12, "alignment:full" 142}}}
