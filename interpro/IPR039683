{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Lsm12 and its homologues. Lsm12  is a putative RNA-binding and regulation protein that might be involved in mRNA degradation or tRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00044226]]. Recently, it was demonstrated that it binds nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) that confers NAADP sensitivity to the two pore channel complex (TPCs) by acting as TPC accessory protein necessary for NAADP-evoked Ca2 release [[cite:PUB00101073]]. Therefore, further studies of the potential crosstalk between NAADP signaling and RNA regulation are required.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Sm and Sm-like proteins of the Lsm (like Sm) domain family are generally involved in essential RNA-processing tasks [[cite:PUB00016606]].
