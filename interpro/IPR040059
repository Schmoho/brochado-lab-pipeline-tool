{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family contain a CPL domain, which is a C-terminal domain found in Penguin-like proteins, and Pumilio RNA-binding repeats.  Proteins include the following:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pumilio homologue 3 (PUM3; also known as Puf-A), which inhibits the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP1 and the degradation of PARP1 by CASP3 following genotoxic stress [[cite:PUB00090472]].  Tertiary structure determination has revealed that PUM3 has eleven PUM repeats arranged in an L-shape, and in contrast to classical PUF proteins, PUM3 forms sequence-independent interactions with DNA or RNA, mediated by conserved basic residues [[cite:PUB00090473]].</li>\r\n<li>Pumilio homology domain family member 6 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is an RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation and represses ASH1 mRNA translation.  ASH1 is a a protein determinant for mating-type switching [[cite:PUB00090474]].</li>\r\n<li>Protein penguin from Drosophila melanogaster.</li>\r\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13389" "PUMILIO HOMOLOG 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pumilio homologue 3", "short" "PUM3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2507, "taxa" 8508, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4783, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4783, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3067}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040059", :literature {"PUB00090472" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chang HY" "Fan CC" "Chu PC" "Hong BE" "Lee HJ" "Chang MS."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1831", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "hPuf-A/KIAA0020 modulates PARP-1 cleavage upon genotoxic stress.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1126-34", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21266351}, "PUB00090473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Qiu C" "McCann KL" "Wine RN" "Baserga SJ" "Hall TM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
