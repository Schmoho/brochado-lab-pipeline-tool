{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases ([ec:3.1.2.-]), enzymes from bacteria and plants that control the termination of fatty acid synthesis by hydrolyzing the acyl-ACP complexes and determines the fatty acid profiles produced by an organism [[cite:PUB00097731], [cite:PUB00097733], [cite:PUB00097732]]. These enzymes are classified as FatA and FatB. FatA thioesterases (or oleoyl-thioesterases) are highly conserved between different plant species and have high specificity for oleoyl-ACP [[cite:PUB00097731]]. Unlike FatA, FatB thioesterases are much more variable and preferentially hydrolyse acyl-ACPs with saturated fatty acyl chains; they can be classified in subfamilies depending on their substrate of preference [[cite:PUB00098154]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gak", "name" "Crystal structure of acyl-ACP thioesterase from Spirosoma linguale"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31727" "OLEOYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN THIOESTERASE 1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase FATA/B", "short" "FATA/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1625, "taxa" 6845, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9426, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9426, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6672}, "pathways" 49}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
