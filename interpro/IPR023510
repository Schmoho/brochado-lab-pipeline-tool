{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH,[ec:1.2.1.27]) catalyses the irreversible NAD+- and CoA-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of methylmalonate semialdehyde to propionyl-CoA. Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase has been characterised in both prokaryotes [[cite:PUB00002721], [cite:PUB00013470]] and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00013471]], functioning as a mammalian tetramer and a bacterial homodimer. Although similar in monomeric molecular mass and enzymatic activity, the N-terminal sequence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not correspond with the N-terminal sequence predicted for rat liver. Sequence homology to a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases places MMSDH in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) superfamily making MMSDH's CoA requirement unique among known ALDHs. Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is closely related to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and class 1 and 2 aldehyde dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00013471]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the Gram-positive proteins involved in inositol metabolism [[cite:PUB00087086]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01670" "Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase [iolA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, Gram-positive bacteria", "short" "MSDH_GmP_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 344, "taxa" 1134, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1561, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1154}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
