{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The recA gene product is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a role in homologous recombination, DNA repair and induction of the SOS response [[cite:PUB00003747]]. In homologous recombination, the protein functions as a DNA-dependent ATPase, promoting synapsis, heteroduplex formation and strand exchange between homologous DNAs [[cite:PUB00003747]]. RecA also acts as a protease cofactor that promotes autodigestion of the lexA product and phage repressors. The proteolytic inactivation of the lexA repressor by an activated form of recA may cause a derepression of the 20 or so genes involved in the SOS response, which regulates DNA repair, induced mutagenesis, delayed cell division and prophage induction in response to DNA damage [[cite:PUB00003747]].</p>\n\n<p>RecA is a protein of about 350 amino-acid residues. Its sequence is very well conserved [[cite:PUB00004946], [cite:PUB00002285], [cite:PUB00003439]] among eubacterial species. It is also found in the chloroplast of plants [[cite:PUB00004797]]. RecA-like proteins are found in archaea and diverse eukaryotic organisms, like fission yeast, mouse or human. In the filament visualised by X-ray crystallography, β-strand 3, the loop C-terminal to β-strand 2, and α-helix D of the core domain form one surface that packs against α-helix A and β-strand 0 (the N-terminal domain) of an adjacent monomer during polymerisation [[cite:PUB00043276]]. The core ATP-binding site domain is well conserved, with 14 invariant residues. It contains the nucleotide binding loop between β-strand 1 and α-helix C. The Escherichia coli sequence GPESSGKT matches the consensus sequence of amino acids (G/A)XXXXGK(T/S) for the Walker A box (also referred to as the P-loop) found in a number of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-binding proteins. Another nucleotide binding motif, the Walker B box is found at β-strand 4 in the RecA structure. The Walker B box is characterised by four hydrophobic amino acids followed by an acidic residue (usually aspartate). Nucleotide specificity and additional ATP binding interactions are contributed by the amino acid residues at β-strand 2 and the loop C-terminal to that strand, all of which are greater than 90% conserved among bacterial RecA proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hr8", "name" "Crystal Structure of Thermotoga maritima RecA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023400", "name" "DNA recombination and repair protein RecA, C-terminal, superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45900" "RECA"}, "hamap" {"MF_00268" "Protein RecA [recA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02012" "recombinase RecA"}, "prints" {"PR00142" "RecA protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA recombination and repair protein RecA", "short" "DNA_recomb/repair_RecA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 85, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9847, "taxa" 52443, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 71627, "sets" 0, "proteins" 70678, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 56384}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0215", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0215"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013765", :literature {"PUB00003747" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Selbitschka W" "Arnold W" "Priefer UB" "Rottschafer T" "Schmidt M" "Simon R" "Puhler A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
