{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterioferritin (BFR; also known as cytochrome b1 or cytochrome b557) [[cite:PUB00000570], [cite:PUB00000615]] of Escherichia coli is an iron-storage protein consisting of 24 identical subunits that pack together to form a highly symmetrical, nearly spherical shell surrounding a central cavity of about 8 nm diameter [[cite:PUB00000672], [cite:PUB00000540]]. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed a close structural similarity between BFR and the ferritins, a family of iron-storage proteins found in both eukaryotes and bacteria [[cite:PUB00000672]]. Common to both ferritins and BFRs is a capacity to store large quantities of iron within their hollow interior, in the form of a hydrated ferric oxide mineral containing variable amounts of phosphate anion. However, a major difference between them is that BFR contains up 12 b-type haem groups, while ferritins, as isolated, do not contain haem.</p>\n\n<p>The building block for the BFR shell is a protein dimer (subunits A and B) binding the single haem group. Each subunit consists of four nearly parallel Î±-helices. The haem is bound symmetrically to subunits A and B by Met(A)-52 and Met(B)-52 residues [[cite:PUB00003913]]. Each subunit includes a binuclear metal-binding site linking together the four major helices of the subunit, which has been identified as the ferroxidase centre of BFR [[cite:PUB00000540]]. The ferroxidase centre is where that initial oxidation of ferrous iron by molecular oxygen occurs, facilitating the detoxification of iron, protection against dioxygen and radical products, and storage of ferric-hydroxyphosphate at the core [[cite:PUB00019549]]. BFR mutants with Met-52 replaced are haem-free, but appear to be correctly assembled and are capable of accumulating iron [[cite:PUB00002921]]. Some bacterioferritins are composed of two subunit types, one conferring heme-binding ability (alpha) and the other (beta) bestowing ferroxidase activity [[cite:PUB00019549]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3r2k", "name" "1.55A resolution structure of As-Isolated FtnA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pH 7.5)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00907" "Bacterioferritin, ferritin-like diiron-binding domain"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002560" "Bacterioferritin"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00754" "bacterioferritin"}, "prints" {"PR00601" "BACFERRITIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterioferritin", "short" "Bacterioferritin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 101, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3714, "taxa" 15585, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23764, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19926, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15575}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00475", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00475"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
