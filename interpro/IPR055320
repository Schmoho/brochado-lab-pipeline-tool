{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes centrosomal protein of 72 kDa (CEP72) which is involved in centrosomal and spindle assembly functions [[cite:PUB00061741]]. CEP72 plays a crucial role in the recruitment of essential proteins to the centrosome, a key cellular structure involved in organising microtubules. They are responsible for providing microtubule-nucleation activity through interaction with gamma-tubulin ring complexes (gamma-TuRCs), which is essential for the formation of a focused bipolar spindle during cell division. This spindle formation is necessary for generating proper tension between sister chromatids [[cite:PUB00061741]]. Additionally, these proteins are implicated in the process of centriole duplication, ensuring the correct replication and segregation of these organelles. They also promote the centrosomal localisation of various proteins including CDK2, KIZ, AKAP9, CDK5RAP22, CEP152, WDR62, and CEP63 [[cite:PUB00076882]]. This entry also includes leucine rich repeat containing 36 which is probably a CEP72 paralogue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23311" "HEAT SHOCK REGULATED 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Centrosomal protein of 72 kDa-like", "short" "CEP72-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 357, "taxa" 1567, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1090, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1090, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 647}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055320", :literature {"PUB00076882" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kodani A" "Yu TW" "Johnson JR" "Jayaraman D" "Johnson TL" "Al-Gazali L" "Sztriha L" "Partlow JN" "Kim H" "Krup AL" "Dammermann A" "Krogan NJ" "Walsh CA" "Reiter JF."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07519", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Centriolar satellites assemble centrosomal microcephaly proteins to recruit CDK2 and promote centriole duplication.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26297806}, "PUB00061741" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Oshimori N" "Li X" "Ohsugi M" "Yamamoto T."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2009.161", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Cep72 regulates the localization of key centrosomal proteins and proper bipolar spindle formation.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "2066-76", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19536135}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055320", "name" "Centrosomal protein of 72 kDa-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
