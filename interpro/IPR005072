{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes metallopeptidases from poxvirus that belong to MEROPS peptidase family M44 (clan ME). The active site residues for members of this family occur in the motif HXXEH. This protein family inlcudes Metalloendopeptidase G1 from Vaccinia virus, also known as Metalloendopeptidase OPG085, which appears to play a role in the maturation of viral proteins by processing them preferentially at Ala-Gly-|-Ser/Thr/Lys motifs.
