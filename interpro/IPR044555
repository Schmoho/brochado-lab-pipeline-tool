{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes WUSCHEL and homeodomain WUSCHEL-RELATED (WOX) proteins from plants. Proteins in this entry have been classified as a WOX clade that contains the WUS, WOX1, WOX2, WOX3, WOX5, WOX6 and WOX7. WUSCHEL is a transcription factor that plays a central role during early embryogenesis, oogenesis and flowering [[cite:PUB00096440], [cite:PUB00096439]]. WOXs are transcription factors that regulate meristem development in embryos, as well as vegetative and reproductive organs [[cite:PUB00096441]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ry3", "name" "Structure of the WUS homeodomain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45940" "WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein WUSCHEL-like", "short" "WUSCHEL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 238, "taxa" 1081, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3633, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2401}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044555", :literature {"PUB00096441" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Wu CC" "Li FW" "Kramer EM."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Large-scale phylogenomic analysis suggests three ancient superclades of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX transcription factor family in plants.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "e0223521", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31603924}, "PUB00096439" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lohmann JU" "Hong RL" "Hobe M" "Busch MA" "Parcy F" "Simon R" "Weigel D."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A molecular link between stem cell regulation and floral patterning in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "793-803", "volume" "105", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11440721}, "PUB00096440" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Mayer KF" "Schoof H" "Haecker A" "Lenhard M" "Jurgens G" "Laux T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Role of WUSCHEL in regulating stem cell fate in the Arabidopsis shoot meristem.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "805-15", "volume" "95", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9865698}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0099402", "name" "plant organ development", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044555", "name" "Protein WUSCHEL-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
