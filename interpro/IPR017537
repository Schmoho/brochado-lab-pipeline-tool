{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains sequences related to MEROPS peptidase family M42, a glutamyl aminopeptidase family that also includes the cellulase CelM from Clostridium thermocellum and deblocking aminopeptidases that can remove acylated amino acids. Members of this family occur in a three gene cassette with an amidotransferase ([interpro:IPR017535])in the asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) family, and a probable acetyltransferase ([interpro:IPR017534]) in the GNAT family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03106" "osmoprotectant NAGGN system M42 family peptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M42, hydrolase", "short" "Peptidase_M42_hydrolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 416, "taxa" 2189, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1944, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1944, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1490}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0668", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0668"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017537", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008007", "name" "Peptidase M42", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017537", "name" "Peptidase M42, hydrolase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017538", "name" "Peptidase M42, glutamyl aminopeptidase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
