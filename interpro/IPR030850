{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Csl4 is a non-catalytic component of the exosome, a complex involved in RNA processing and degradation [[cite:PUB00035570], [cite:PUB00074124]]. he exosome consists of Rrp4, Rrp41, Rrp42 and Csl4. The subunits Rrp41 and Rrp42 form a phosphorolytically active hexamer, with an RNA-binding cap on the top consisting of a homotrimer of either Rrp4 or Csl4. The presence of different proteins in the cap may enable interactions with different substrates. It has been shown that the archaeal DnaG protein needs Csl4 for binding to the exosome. DnaG is a poly(A)-binding protein and enhances the degradation of adenine-rich transcripts by the Csl4-exosome [[cite:PUB00074085]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00975" "Exosome complex component Csl4 [csl4]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosome complex component Csl4, archaea", "short" "Exosome_Csl4_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 140, "taxa" 1241, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1607, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1397}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030850", :literature {"PUB00035570" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Buttner K" "Wenig K" "Hopfner KP."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
