{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes metal-fist type transcriptional repressors of copper transport systems such as copYZAB of Enterococcus hirae and tcrYAZB (transferable copper resistance) of an Enterococcus faecium (Streptococcus faecium) plasmid. High levels of copper can displace zinc and prevent binding by the repressor, activating efflux by copper resistance transporters. The most closely related proteins excluded by this entry are antibiotic resistance regulators including the methicillin resistance regulatory protein MecI.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02698" "CopY/TcrY family copper transport repressor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Copper transport repressor CopY/TcrY", "short" "Cu_transp_CopY/TcrY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 309, "taxa" 1537, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1850, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1850, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1450}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014071", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005650", "name" "BlaI transcriptional regulatory family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR014071", "name" "Copper transport repressor CopY/TcrY", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
