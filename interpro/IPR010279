It is possible that YqjD inactivates ribosomes by localizing a part of the ribosome to the membrane during the stationary phase [[cite:PUB00086977]]. Its expression is regulated by stress response sigma factor RpoS. The two paralogues of YqjD, ElaB and YgaM, are expressed and bind to ribosomes in a similar manner to YqjD [[cite:PUB00086977], [cite:PUB00086978]].  These proteins may have important cellular roles during the stress response. ElaB has been shown to protect cells against oxidative and heat shock stress [[cite:PUB00086978]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35893" "INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inner membrane protein YqjD/ElaB", "short" "YqjD/ElaB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1072, "taxa" 5757, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9963, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9963, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7963}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010279", :literature {"PUB00086978" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Guo Y" "Liu X" "Li B" "Yao J" "Wood TK" "Wang X."], "ISO_journal" "J.
