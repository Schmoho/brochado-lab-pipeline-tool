{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Escherichia coli DinF is a membrane protein that has been found to protect cells against oxidative stress and bile salts [[cite:PUB00096593]]. The expression of DinF is regulated as part of the SOS system. It may act by detoxifying oxidizing molecules that have the potential to damage DNA [[cite:PUB00096595]]. Some member of this family have been reported to enhance the virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria by enhancing their ability to grow in the presence of toxic compounds [[cite:PUB00096594]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes DETOXIFICATION 42-47 (DTX42-47) from Arabidopsis. DTX42 (also known as AtMATE) is a citrate transporter critical for aluminum tolerance [[cite:PUB00059248]].
