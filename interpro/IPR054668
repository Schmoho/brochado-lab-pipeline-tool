{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the methanobactin biosynthesis FAD monooxygenase MbnF, an NADPH-dependent flavin monooxygenase from Methylocystis sp. ([swissprot:A0AA82WPF6], [[cite:PUB00154791], [cite:PUB00154790]]). Methanobactins (MBs) are ribosomally produced and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that are used by methanotrophs for copper acquisition. MbnF preferentially oxidises NADPH over NADH, supporting NAD(P)H-mediated flavin reduction, which is the initial step in the reaction cycle of several type A FMO enzymes. It is also shown that MbnF binds the precursor peptide for MB [[cite:PUB00154791]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045577" "methanobactin biosynthesis FAD monooxygenase MbnF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methanobactin biosynthesis FAD monooxygenase MbnF", "short" "FAD_mono_MbnF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 25, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054668", :literature {"PUB00154790" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Park YJ" "Roberts GM" "Montaser R" "Kenney GE" "Thomas PM" "Kelleher NL" "Rosenzweig AC."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00443", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Characterization of a Copper-Chelating Natural Product from the Methanotroph <i>Methylosinus</i> sp.
