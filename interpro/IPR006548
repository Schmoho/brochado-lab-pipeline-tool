{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences represent the ELAV/Hu subfamily of splicing factors found in metazoa. ELAV stands for the Drosophila Embryonic lethal abnormalvisual protein [[cite:PUB00009747]]. ELAV-like splicing factors are also known in human as HuB (ELAV-like protein 2), HuC (ELAV-like protein 3, HuD (LAV-like protein 4) and HuR (ELAV-like protein 1). HuR is ubiquitously expressed whereas HuB, HuC and HuD are neuron-specific [[cite:PUB00084953]]. HuD stands for the human paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen D of which there are 4 variants in human [[cite:PUB00000859]]. These genes are most closely related to the sex-lethal subfamily of splicing factors found in Dipteran insects ([interpro:IPR006546]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fxl", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF HUD AND AU-RICH ELEMENT OF THE C-FOS RNA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035979", "name" "RNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01661" "ELAV/HuD family splicing factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Splicing factor ELAV/Hu", "short" "ELAD_HU_SF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 960, "taxa" 3914, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7863, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7863, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4901}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006548", :literature {"PUB00000859" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Szabo A" "Dalmau J" "Manley G" "Rosenfeld M" "Wong E" "Henson J" "Posner JB" "Furneaux HM."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(91)90184-Z", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "HuD, a paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen, contains RNA-binding domains and is homologous to Elav and Sex-lethal.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "325-33", "volume" "67", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1655278}, "PUB00009747" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4885", "authors" ["Robinow S" "Campos AR" "Yao KM" "White K."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/242/4885/1570", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The elav gene product of Drosophila, required in neurons, has three RNP consensus motifs.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "1570-2", "volume" "242", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3144044}, "PUB00084953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Mansfield KD" "Keene JD."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr1114", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Neuron-specific ELAV/Hu proteins suppress HuR mRNA during neuronal differentiation by alternative polyadenylation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "2734-46", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22139917}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002343", "name" "Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006546", "name" "Sex-lethal splicing factor", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006548", "name" "Splicing factor ELAV/Hu", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
