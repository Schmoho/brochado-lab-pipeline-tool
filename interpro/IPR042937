The 'fused' gene family includes multifunctional epidermal differentiation proteins - profilaggrin, trichohyalin, repetin [[cite:PUB00078122]], hornerin, and cornulin; functionally these proteins are associated with keratin intermediate filaments and partially crosslinked to the cell envelope. These 'fused' gene proteins contain N-terminal sequence with two Ca-binding EF-hands motif, which may be associated with calcium signalling in epidermal cells and autoprocessing in a calcium-dependent manner. In contrast to S100 proteins, 'fused' gene family proteins contain an extraordinary high number of almost perfect peptide repeats with regular array of polar and charged residues similar to many known cell envelope proteins [[cite:PUB00083252]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47612" "TRICHOHYALIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trichohyalin-like protein 1", "short" "TCHHL1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 103, "taxa" 366, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 143, "sets" 0, "proteins" 143, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 93}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042937", :literature {"PUB00093502" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yamakoshi T" "Makino T" "Ur Rehman M" "Yoshihisa Y" "Sugimori M" "Shimizu T."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
