{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the Helicobacter pylori protein CagE ([ec:7.4.2.8]), which together with other proteins from the cag pathogenicity island (PAI), encodes a type IV transporter secretion system. It is the ATPase component of the type IV secretion system Cag (Cag-T4SS) that may acts as a molecular motor to provide the energy that is required for the export of proteins. It is essential for pathogenesis in Helicobacter pylori induced gastritis and peptic ulceration [[cite:PUB00007538]], being required for CagA translocation and induction of IL-8 in host gastric epithelial cells [[cite:PUB00097879]]. Indeed, the expression of the cag PAI has been shown to be essential for stimulating human gastric epithelial cell apoptosis in vitro [[cite:PUB00007539]]. CagE plays a key role in Cag-T4SS pilus biogenesis, especially in the localization and stabilization of the pilus-associated components CagI, CagL and the surface protein CagH [[cite:PUB00097879]] and it is also critical for assembly of the entire cytoplasmic portion of the Cag inner membrane complex (IMC) [[cite:PUB00097878]].</p>\n\n<p>Similar type IV transport systems are also found in other bacteria. This family includes proteins from the trb and Vir conjugal transfer systems in\n  Agrobacterium tumefaciens and homologues of VirB proteins from other species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00929" "VirB4 family type IV secretion/conjugal transfer ATPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CagE, TrbE, VirB component of type IV transporter system", "short" "CagE_TrbE_VirB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 564, "taxa" 3027, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4112, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4112, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3391}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0485", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0485"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
