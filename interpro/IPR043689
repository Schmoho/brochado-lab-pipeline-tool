It is present in microorganisms that lack orthologues of Glu racemase or d-Glu aminotransferase, such as Xanthomonas oryzae, and allow the biosynthesis of d-Glu together with MurD2, via an alternative pathway during the peptidoglycan biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00094462]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02209" "UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-muramoyl-L-alanyl-L-glutamate epimerase [murL]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-muramoyl-L-alanyl-L-glutamate epimerase MurL", "short" "MurL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 366, "taxa" 1889, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1663, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1663, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1264}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
