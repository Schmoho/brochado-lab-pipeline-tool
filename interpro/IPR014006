{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the flavoprotein subunit found in both the SQR and QFR enzymes. This subunit contains an N-terminal domain which binds the FAD cofactor, a central catalytic domain with an unusual fold, and a C-terminal domain whose role is unclear [[cite:PUB00007431], [cite:PUB00028408], [cite:PUB00015752]]. The dicarboxylate binding site is located between the FAD and catalytic domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Succinate:quinone oxidoreductase ([ec:1.3.5.1]) refers collectively to succinate:quinone reductase (SQR, or Complex II) and quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR) [[cite:PUB00015792]]. SQR is found in aerobic organisms, and catalyses the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the citric acid cycle and donates the electrons to quinone in the membrane. QFR can be found in anaerobic cells respiring with fumarate as terminal electron acceptor. SQR and QFR are very similar in composition and structure, despite catalysing opposite reactions<i>in vivo</i>. They are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor, and in Escherichia coli they are capable of functionally replacing each other [[cite:PUB00033856]].</p>\n\n<p>Succinate:quinone oxidoreductases consist of a peripheral domain, exposed to the cytoplasm in bacteria and to the matrix in mitochondria, and a membrane-integral anchor domain that spans the membrane (Fig. 1). The peripheral part, which contains the dicarboxylate binding site, is composed of a flavoprotein subunit, with one covalently bound FAD, and an iron-sulphur protein subunit containing three iron-sulphur clusters. The membrane-integral domain functions to anchor the peripheral domain to the membrane and is required for quinone reduction and oxidation. The anchor domain shows the largest variability in composition and primary sequence, being composed either of one large subunit, or two smaller subunits, which may, or may not, contain protoheme groups.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8dye", "name" "Crystal structure of human SDHA-SDHAF4 assembly intermediate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01812" "succinate dehydrogenase or fumarate reductase, flavoprotein subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase, flavoprotein subunit", "short" "Succ_Dhase_FrdA_Gneg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 89, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7242, "taxa" 27780, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27895, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27889, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20926}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1672"} {"accession" "GenProp1267", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1267"} {"accession" "GenProp1493", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1493"} {"accession" "GenProp1515", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1515"} {"accession" "GenProp1391", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1391"} {"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp1537", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1537"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
