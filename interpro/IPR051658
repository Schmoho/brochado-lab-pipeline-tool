{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ubiquitin-like domain-containing CTD phosphatase 1 (UBLCP1) is characterised by an ubiquitin-like domain that mediates interactions with proteasomes. Members of this family are involved in the regulation of proteasome activity by dephosphorylating 26S nuclear proteasomes, which results in a decrease in their proteolytic activity [[cite:PUB00059035], [cite:PUB00155283]]. These proteins are recruited to the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, where they target components such as PSMC2/RPT1, impairing ATPase activity and disrupting proteasome assembly [[cite:PUB00155283]]. Some reports also suggest that members UBLCP1 can stimulate the proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome, indicating a complex role in proteasome regulation [[cite:PUB00155284]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3shq", "name" "Crystal Structure of UBLCP1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48493" "UBIQUITIN-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING CTD PHOSPHATASE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin-like domain-containing CTD phosphatase 1", "short" "UBLCP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1523, "taxa" 5916, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2680, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2680, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1775}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
