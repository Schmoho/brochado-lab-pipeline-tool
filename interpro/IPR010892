{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a conserved region approximately 140 residues long within secreted phosphoprotein 24 (Spp-24), which seems to be restricted to vertebrates [[cite:PUB00033902]]. This is a non-collagenous protein found in bone that is related in sequence to the cystatin family of thiol protease inhibitors. This suggests that Spp-24 could function to modulate the thiol protease activities known to be involved in bone turnover. It is also possible that the intact form of Spp-24 found in bone could be a precursor to a biologically active peptide that coordinates an aspect of bone turnover [[cite:PUB00013157]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046350", "name" "Cystatin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07448" "Secreted phosphoprotein 24 (Spp-24) cystatin-like domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR15444" "SECRETED PHOSPHOPROTEIN 24"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secreted phosphoprotein 24", "short" "Spp-24"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 576, "taxa" 1888, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 815, "sets" 0, "proteins" 804, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 577}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010892", :literature {"PUB00013157" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hu B" "Coulson L" "Moyer B" "Price PA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
