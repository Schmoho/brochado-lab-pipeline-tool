{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase ([ec:1.4.3.5]) is an enzyme that is involved in the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and pyridoxal phosphate. It oxidizes pyridoxamine-5-P (PMP) and pyridoxine-5-P (PNP) to pyridoxal-5-P. The enzyme requires the presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor, although there is some evidence that coenzyme F420 may perform this role in some species [[cite:PUB00055044]].</p>\n\n<p>The sequences of the enzyme from bacterial (genes pdxH or fprA) [[cite:PUB00002199]] and fungal (gene PDX3) [[cite:PUB00002264]] sources show that this protein has been highly conserved throughout evolution. PdxH is evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00001735]] to one of the enzymes in the phenazine biosynthesis protein pathway, phzD (also known as phzG) [[cite:PUB00155385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ylz", "name" "X-ray structure of the K72I,Y129F,R133L, H199A quadruple mutant of PNP-oxidase from E. coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012349", "name" "FMN-binding split barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01629" "Pyridoxine/pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase [pdxH]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00558" "pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase"}, "panther" {"PTHR10851" "PYRIDOXINE-5-PHOSPHATE OXIDASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000190" "Pyd_amn-ph_oxd"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase", "short" "Pyridox_Oxase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8064, "taxa" 29298, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33511, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33280, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24744}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00815", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00815"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1604", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1604"} {"accession" "GenProp1633", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1633"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
