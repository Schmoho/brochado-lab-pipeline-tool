{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 1 (BLTP1, formerly known as Tweek/KIAA1109/FSA in human) is a tube-forming lipid transport protein which provides phosphatidylethanolamine for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays a role in endosomal trafficking and endosome recycling and it is also involved in the actin cytoskeleton and cilia structural dynamics [[cite:PUB00101872], [cite:PUB00101861]]. BLTP1 also acts as a regulator of phagocytosis [[cite:PUB00101871]]. In humans, it has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis [[cite:PUB00079304], [cite:PUB00079303]]. Mutations of the BLTP1 gene has been associated with Alkuraya-Kucinskas syndrome (MIM 617822), a severe disorder of brain development and arthrogryposis [[cite:PUB00090168]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this entry belong to the repeating β-groove (RBG) superfamily together with VPS13, ATG2, SHIP164, BLTP2/FMP27, which are all conserved lipid transfer proteins containing long hydrophobic grooves [[cite:PUB00101861]]. They all share the same structure comprising multiple repeating modules consisting of five β-sheets followed by a loop.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31640" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN KIAA1109"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 1", "short" "BLTP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 725, "taxa" 3250, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4170, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4170, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1105}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033616", :literature {"PUB00079303" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Louahchi S" "Allam I" "Raaf N" "Berkani L" "Boucharef A" "Abdessemed A" "Khaldoun N" "Bahaz N" "Ladjouze-Rezig A" "Nebbab A" "Ghaffor M" "Djidjik R."], "ISO_journal" "HLA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tan.12757", "medline_journal" "HLA", "title" "Association of rs6822844 within the KIAA1109/TENR/IL2/IL21 locus with rheumatoid arthritis in the Algerian population.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "160-4", "volume" "87", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26917059}, "PUB00079304" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hollis-Moffatt JE" "Chen-Xu M" "Topless R" "Dalbeth N" "Gow PJ" "Harrison AA" "Highton J" "Jones PB" "Nissen M" "Smith MD" "van Rij A" "Jones GT" "Stamp LK" "Merriman TR."], "ISO_journal" "Arthritis Res.
