{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of DNA-binding proteins, mainly found in bacteria and plants. Members of this family form homodimers which bind DNA via a tweezer-like structure [[cite:PUB00026293], [cite:PUB00057452], [cite:PUB00057453], [cite:PUB00095231]]. The conformation of the DNA is changed when bound to these proteins [[cite:PUB00057453]]. In bacteria, these proteins may play a role in DNA replication-recovery following DNA damage [[cite:PUB00026293]]. The plant form contains an additional N-terminal region that may serve as a transit peptide and shows a close relationship to the cyanobacterial member, suggesting that it is a chloroplast protein.</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure YbaB from Haemophilus influenzae revealed a core structure consisting of two layers, α/β; YbaB forms a tight dimer with a 3-layer structure, β/α/β [[cite:PUB00026293]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3f42", "name" "Crystal structure of uncharacterized protein HP0035 from Helicobacter pylori"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036894", "name" "Nucleoid-associated protein YbaB-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33449" "NUCLEOID-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN YBAB"}, "hamap" {"MF_00274" "Nucleoid-associated protein YbaB [ybaB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00103" "YbaB/EbfC family nucleoid-associated protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004555" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP004555 type"}, "pfam" {"PF02575" "YbaB/EbfC DNA-binding family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoid-associated protein YbaB/EbfC", "short" "YbaB/EbfC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 50, "proteomes" 8407, "taxa" 33452, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42340, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42297, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32785}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004401", :literature {"PUB00026293" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lim K" "Tempczyk A" "Parsons JF" "Bonander N" "Toedt J" "Kelman Z" "Howard A" "Eisenstein E" "Herzberg O."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10297", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Crystal structure of YbaB from Haemophilus influenzae (HI0442), a protein of unknown function coexpressed with the recombinational DNA repair protein RecR.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "375-9", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12486730}, "PUB00057452" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Cooley AE" "Riley SP" "Kral K" "Miller MC" "DeMoll E" "Fried MG" "Stevenson B."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Microbiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-9-137", "medline_journal" "BMC Microbiol", "title" "DNA-binding by Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli YbaB, members of a widely-distributed bacterial protein family.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "137", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19594923}, "PUB00057453" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Riley SP" "Bykowski T" "Cooley AE" "Burns LH" "Babb K" "Brissette CA" "Bowman A" "Rotondi M" "Miller MC" "DeMoll E" "Lim K" "Fried MG" "Stevenson B."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp027", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Borrelia burgdorferi EbfC defines a newly-identified, widespread family of bacterial DNA-binding proteins.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1973-83", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19208644}, "PUB00095231" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Jutras BL" "Bowman A" "Brissette CA" "Adams CA" "Verma A" "Chenail AM" "Stevenson B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
