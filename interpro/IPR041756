{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Streptomyces griseus Aminopeptidase (SGAP, Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), aminopeptidase S, Mername-AA022 peptidase) subfamily of the peptidase family M28. SGAP is a di-zinc exopeptidase with high preference towards large hydrophobic amino-terminal residues, with Leu being the most efficiently cleaved [[cite:PUB00091793]]. It can accommodate all except Pro and Glu residues in the P1' position. It is a monomeric (30kDa), calcium-activated and calcium-stabilized enzyme; its activation by calcium correlates with substrate specificity and it has thermal stability only in the presence of calcium. Although SGAP contains a calcium binding site, it is not conserved in many members of this subfamily. SGAP is present in the extracellular fluid of S. griseus cultures [[cite:PUB00091794], [cite:PUB00022547]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tkj", "name" "Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase complexed with D-Methionine"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03876" "M28 Zn-peptidase Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M28, SGAP-like", "short" "M28_SGAP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1422, "taxa" 4171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4920, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4917, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3460}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
