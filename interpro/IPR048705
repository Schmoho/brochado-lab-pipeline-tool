{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Legionella pneumophila modulates the host metabolism of phosphoinositides (PIs) to impair membrane trafficking and establish the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) for its own replication. The virulence factor SidF ([swissprot:Q5ZSD5]) is a unique PI phosphatase that specifically hydrolyses PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. This protein shows a large single domain that resembles a cowboy hat, which consists of 19 α-helices located around a 10-stranded twisted β-sheet core ([pdbe:4FYE]) [[cite:PUB00061093]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20988" "Phosphoinositide phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoinositide phosphatase SidF-like", "short" "SidF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048705", :literature {"PUB00061093" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Hsu F" "Zhu W" "Brennan L" "Tao L" "Luo ZQ" "Mao Y."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
