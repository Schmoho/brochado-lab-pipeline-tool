{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is found in eukaryotes. There is a single completely conserved residue D that may be functionally important. The family includes CFAP276 and homologues. Bovin CFAP276 has been identified as a microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating [[cite:PUB00100771]]. Members of this family have been suggested to be involved in intracellular Ca2 homeostasis [[cite:PUB00093604]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12494" "Protein of unknown function (DUF3695)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 276", "short" "CFAP276"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 469, "taxa" 2216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 885, "sets" 0, "proteins" 885, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 543}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022179", :literature {"PUB00100771" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Gui M" "Farley H" "Anujan P" "Anderson JR" "Maxwell DW" "Whitchurch JB" "Botsch JJ" "Qiu T" "Meleppattu S" "Singh SK" "Zhang Q" "Thompson J" "Lucas JS" "Bingle CD" "Norris DP" "Roy S" "Brown A."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "De novo identification of mammalian ciliary motility proteins using cryo-EM.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "5791-5806.e19", "volume" "184", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34715025}, "PUB00093604" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Sun SC" "Ma D" "Li MY" "Zhang RX" "Huang C" "Huang HJ" "Xie YZ" "Wang ZJ" "Liu J" "Cai DC" "Liu CX" "Yang Q" "Bao FX" "Gong XL" "Li JR" "Hui Z" "Wei XF" "Zhong JM" "Zhou WJ" "Shang X" "Zhang C" "Liu XG" "Tang BS" "Xiong F" "Xu XM."], "ISO_journal" "Brain", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Brain", "title" "Mutations in C1orf194, encoding a calcium regulator, cause dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "2215-2229", "volume" "142", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31199454}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022179", "name" "Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 276", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 19, "alignment:full" 582}}}
