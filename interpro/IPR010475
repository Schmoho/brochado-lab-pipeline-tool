{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several insect adipokinetic hormone as well as the related crustacean red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH) [[cite:PUB00019107]]. Flight activity of insects comprises one of the most intense biochemical processes known in nature, and therefore provides an attractive model system to study the hormonal regulation of metabolism during physical exercise. In long-distance flying insects, such as the migratory locust, both carbohydrate and lipid reserves are utilised as fuels for sustained flight activity. The mobilisation of these energy stores in Locusta migratoria (Migratory locust) is mediated by three structurally related adipokinetic hormones (AKHs), which are all capable of stimulating the release of both carbohydrates and lipids from the fat body [[cite:PUB00012346]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06377" "Adipokinetic hormone"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone", "short" "AKH/RPCH_hormone"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 155, "taxa" 1117, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 485, "sets" 0, "proteins" 484, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 343}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010475", :literature {"PUB00019107" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Martinez-Perez F" "Becerra A" "Valdes J" "Zinker S" "Arechiga H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
