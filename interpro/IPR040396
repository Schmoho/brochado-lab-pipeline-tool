{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Paip2 (also known as Paip2A) and related proteins, such as Paip2B. Paip2 is a transcription repressor that inhibits translation by interdicting PABP (poly(A) binding protein) function [[cite:PUB00090910]]. Paip2B acts in a manner similar to Paip2. However, they are expressed in different tissues and cell lines. Also, Paip2 is more highly ubiquitinated than is Paip2B and is degraded more rapidly by the proteasome [[cite:PUB00090911]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13154" "POLYADENYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyadenylate-binding protein-interacting protein 2-like", "short" "PAIP2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 806, "taxa" 3169, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2070, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2070, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1416}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040396", :literature {"PUB00090910" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Khaleghpour K" "Svitkin YV" "Craig AW" "DeMaria CT" "Deo RC" "Burley SK" "Sonenberg N."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
