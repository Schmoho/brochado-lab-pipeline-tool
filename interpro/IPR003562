{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Like MutT ([interpro:IPR003561]), MutX protein hydrolyses all canonical nucleoside triphosphates at different rates, with a preference for dGTP, yielding nucleoside monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate [[cite:PUB00006647]]. Despite the similarity in enzymatic activity, the two proteins have distinct primary and quaternary structures. Their sequences share only a small region of similarity (the MutT domain), and under the same conditions in which MutT exists as a monomer in solution, MutX behaves as a trimer [[cite:PUB00006647]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01402" "MUTATORMUTX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mutator MutX protein", "short" "Mutator_MutX_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 605, "taxa" 2985, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14436, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2995, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2250}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
