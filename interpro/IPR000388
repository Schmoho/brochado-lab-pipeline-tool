{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 8 and 9 (ABCC8/9, also known as sulfonylurea receptors SUR1/2), a subunit of the beta cell potassium channel (KATP) that associates with certain K<sup>+</sup>channel inward rectifier subunits to form ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup>channels (KATP channels) [[cite:PUB00005203], [cite:PUB00005208], [cite:PUB00103847], [cite:PUB00103846], [cite:PUB00103848]]. These are a family of K<sup>+</sup>channels that are inhibited by intracellular ATP, which can couple metabolic state to cell excitability. Their presence on pancreatic islet beta cells allows the cells to function as metabolic sensors, regulating insulin release in relation to glucose metabolism. Furthermore, SUR is the site of action for the sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents that are used widely for the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. When these agents bind to the sulfonylurea receptor, they reduce KATP channel activity, stimulating insulin release.</p>\n\n<p>SUR1/2 are ABC transporter-like proteins that belong to the ABC transporter family. These proteins are encoded by two closely related genes, of which the second form has three splice variants [[cite:PUB00005551]]. They contain 13-17 transmembrane (TM) domains, with two adenosine nucleotide binding sites nestled in between two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) [[cite:PUB00103848]]. SUR1 has been described as an ADP sensor [[cite:PUB00103846]].</p>\n\n<p>Mutations in SUR genes have been characterised; these can result in truncations of the second predicted nucleotide binding fold, leading to persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, a rare familial disorder characterised by excessive, unregulated insulin secretion.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036640", "name" "ABC transporter type 1, transmembrane domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01092" "SULFNYLUREAR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 8/9", "short" "ABCC8/9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 57, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 659, "taxa" 2305, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16504, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3597, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 396}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000388", :literature {"PUB00005203" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5209", "authors" ["Aguilar-Bryan L" "Nichols CG" "Wechsler SW" "Clement JP 4th" "Boyd AE 3rd" "Gonzalez G" "Herrera-Sosa H" "Nguy K" "Bryan J" "Nelson DA."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/268/5209/423", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Cloning of the beta cell high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor: a regulator of insulin secretion.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "423-6", "volume" "268", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7716547}, "PUB00005551" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Ashcroft FM" "Gribble FM."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Neurosci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01225-9", "medline_journal" "Trends Neurosci", "title" "Correlating structure and function in ATP-sensitive K+ channels.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "288-94", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9683320}, "PUB00005208" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5239", "authors" ["Inagaki N" "Gonoi T" "Clement JP 4th" "Namba N" "Inazawa J" "Gonzalez G" "Aguilar-Bryan L" "Seino S" "Bryan J."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/270/5239/1166", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Reconstitution of IKATP: an inward rectifier subunit plus the sulfonylurea receptor.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "1166-70", "volume" "270", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7502040}, "PUB00103848" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Zhao C" "MacKinnon R."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Molecular structure of an open human K<sub>ATP</sub> channel.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e2112267118", "volume" "118", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34815345}, "PUB00103846" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lee KPK" "Chen J" "MacKinnon R."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Molecular structure of human KATP in complex with ATP and ADP.
