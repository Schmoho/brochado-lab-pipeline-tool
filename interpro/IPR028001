{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family (previously DUF4601) represents the homologs of Stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 5 (SAXO5, also known as C19orf45, TEX45). SAXO5 is a member of the SAXO superfamily of stabilizers that  is ubiquitous in axonemal DMTs as well as stable microtubules of neurons and parasites. SAXO5 is a filamentous SAXO protein that binds along protofilament A04 with 96-nm periodicity [[cite:PUB00151496]]. A typical feature of SAXO proteins is the presence of Mn motif  which forms a 5- to 6-residue helix flanked by a Tyr/Phe residue on one end and by a Ser/Thr on the other that binds the shoulder of the Î±-tubulin S9/S10 loop [[cite:PUB00151502]].  SAXO5 contains 11 Mn motifs and therefore has 96-nm periodicity, matching the external periodicity of the axoneme [[cite:PUB00151496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34828" "TESTIS-EXPRESSED PROTEIN 45"}, "pfam" {"PF15373" "Stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 5", "short" "SAXO5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 327, "taxa" 1315, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 573, "sets" 0, "proteins" 544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 347}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028001", :literature {"PUB00151496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Leung MR" "Zeng J" "Wang X" "Roelofs MC" "Huang W" "Zenezini Chiozzi R" "Hevler JF" "Heck AJR" "Dutcher SK" "Brown A" "Zhang R" "Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.05.026", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural specializations of the sperm tail.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2880-2896.e17", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37327785}, "PUB00151502" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang X" "Fu Y" "Beatty WL" "Ma M" "Brown A" "Sibley LD" "Zhang R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23351-1", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Cryo-EM structure of cortical microtubules from human parasite Toxoplasma gondii identifies their microtubule inner proteins.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "3065", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34031406}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR028001", "name" "Stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 337}}}
