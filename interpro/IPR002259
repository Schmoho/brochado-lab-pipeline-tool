{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nucleosides are hydrophilic molecules and require specialised transport proteins for permeation of cell membranes. There are two types of nucleoside transport processes: equilibrative bidirectional processes driven by chemical gradients and inwardly directed concentrative processes driven by an electrochemical gradient [[cite:PUB00033989]]. The two types of nucleoside transporters are classified into two families: the solute carrier (SLC) 29 and SLC28 families, corresponding to equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters, respectively [[cite:PUB00071908]].</p>\n\n<p>Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are integral membrane proteins which enable the movement of hydrophilic nucleosides and nucleoside analogues down their concentration gradients across cell membranes. ENT family members have been identified in humans, mice, fish, tunicates, slime molds, and bacteria [[cite:PUB00009774]]. This entry also includes ENT from Plasmodium falciparum, which shares low sequence identity with the human ENT1 (hENT1) and is unsusceptible to hENT1 inhibitor, therefore, it is a good candidate to design inhibitors to disrupt the transport activity of PfENT1 and prevent the proliferation of parasites [[cite:PUB00152815]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10332" "EQUILIBRATIVE NUCLEOSIDE TRANSPORTER"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016379" "Equilibrative nucleoside transporter"}, "pfam" {"PF01733" "Nucleoside transporter"}, "prints" {"PR01130" "DERENTRNSPRT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Equilibrative nucleoside transporter", "short" "Eqnu_transpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 159, "proteomes" 2655, "taxa" 9197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14680, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13913, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8971}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002259", :literature {"PUB00152815" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang C" "Yu L" "Zhang J" "Zhou Y" "Sun B" "Xiao Q" "Zhang M" "Liu H" "Li J" "Li J" "Luo Y" "Xu J" "Lian Z" "Lin J" "Wang X" "Zhang P" "Guo L" "Ren R" "Deng D."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37411-1", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structural basis of the substrate recognition and inhibition mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum nucleoside transporter PfENT1.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "1727", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36977719}, "PUB00033989" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Cass CE" "Young JD" "Baldwin SA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
