The DGC can be classified biochemically into three subcomplexes: the cytoplasmic subcomplex (contains dystrophin, the dystrobrevins and the syntrophins), the dystroglycan subcomplex and the sarcoglycan subcomplex. The function of the sarcoglycan subcomplex is not clear. However, mutations in alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-sarcoglycan cause different forms of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) demonstrating its importance for normal muscle function [[cite:PUB00073982]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10132" "ALPHA-/EPSILON-SARCOGLYCAN FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sarcoglycan alpha/epsilon", "short" "Sarcoglycan_alpha/epsilon"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 919, "taxa" 3615, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3837, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3837, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2401}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008908", :literature {"PUB00073492" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Blake DJ" "Weir A" "Newey SE" "Davies KE."], "ISO_journal" "Physiol.
