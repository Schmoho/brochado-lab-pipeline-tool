{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxyltransferase, including mitochondrial MCCB and bacterial AccD1. MCCB is a carboxyltransferase subunit of the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a critical step for leucine and isovaleric acid catabolism [[cite:PUB00098227]]. AccD1 transfers the CO2 from carboxybiotin to the CoA ester substrate in the biotin-dependent acyl-CoA carboxylase complex  [[cite:PUB00098228]]. This entry also includes GCDA from Acidaminococcus fermentans.
