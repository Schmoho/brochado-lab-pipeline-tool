{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In plants, the small GTP-binding proteins called Rops work as signalling switches that control growth, development and plant responses to various environmental stimuli. Rop (Rho of plants) proteins, Rac-like, and atRac in Arabidopsis thaliana belong to the Rho family of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins that turn on signalling pathways by switching from a GDP-bound inactive to a GTP-bound active conformation. Activation depends on guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyse the otherwise slow GDP dissociation for subsequent GTP binding. The plant-specific RopGEFs represent a unique family of exchange factors that display no homology to any known RhoGEFs from animals and fungi. They comprise a highly conserved catalytic domain termed PRONE (plant-specific Rop nucleotide exchanger) with exclusive substrate specificity for members of the Rop family. The PRONE domain has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to promote nucleotide release from Rop [[cite:PUB00043712], [cite:PUB00043713], [cite:PUB00043714]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33101" "ROP GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rop guanine nucleotide exchange factor", "short" "RopGEF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1033, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5835, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5835, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3464}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038937", :literature {"PUB00043714" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 6", "authors" ["Thomas C" "Weyand M" "Wittinghofer A" "Berken A."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
