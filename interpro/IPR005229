{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Endoribonucleases YicC from Escherichia coli and YloC from Bacillus subtilis, and similar bacterial sequences. YicC has been shown to be important for cells in the stationary phase, and essential for growth at high temperatures [[cite:PUB00020576]]. This protein contributes to degradation of the iron-responsive small RNA (sRNA) RhyB via collaboration with the  exoribonuclease PNPase [[cite:PUB00151089]]. It seems to generate a 3'-OH and a 5'-phosphate group. It cleaves preferentially at U residues, but has no activity on dsRNA or dsDNA [[cite:PUB00151088]]. Similarly , YloC was shown to be a metal-dependent enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of single-stranded RNA, preferentially at U residues, and exists in an oligomeric form, most likely a hexamer. As such, YloC shares some characteristics with the SARS-CoV Nsp15 endoribonuclease [[cite:PUB00151088]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30636" "UPF0701 PROTEIN YICC"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00255" "YicC/YloC family endoribonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endoribonuclease YicC/YloC-like", "short" "YicC/YloC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5527, "taxa" 21800, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26505, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19988}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
