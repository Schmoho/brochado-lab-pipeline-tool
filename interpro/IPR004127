{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents prefoldin subunit alpha-like proteins. Prefoldin (PFD) is a chaperone that interacts exclusively with type II chaperonins, hetero-oligomers lacking an obligate co-chaperonin that are found only in eukaryotes (chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide-1 (CCT)) and archaea. Eukaryotic PFD is a multi-subunit complex containing six polypeptides in the molecular mass range of 14-23kDa. In archaea, on the other hand, PFD is composed of two types of subunits, two alpha and four beta. The six subunits associate to form two back-to-back up-and-down eight-stranded barrels, from which hang six coiled coils. Each subunit contributes one (beta subunits) or two (alpha subunits) Î² hairpin turns to the barrels. The coiled coils are formed by the N and C termini of an individual subunit. Overall, this unique arrangement resembles a jellyfish. The eukaryotic PFD hexamer is composed of six different subunits; however, these can be grouped into two alpha-like (PFD3 and -5) and four beta-like (PFD1, -2, -4, and -6) subunits based on amino acid sequence similarity with their archaeal counterparts. Eukaryotic PFD has a six-legged structure similar to that seen in the archaeal homologue [[cite:PUB00013306], [cite:PUB00013187]]. This family contains the archaeal alpha subunit, eukaryotic prefoldin subunits 3 and 5 and the UXT (ubiquitously expressed transcript) family.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic PFD has been shown to bind both actin and tubulin co-translationally. The chaperone then delivers the target protein to CCT, interacting with the chaperonin through the tips of the coiled coils. No authentic target proteins of any archaeal PFD have been identified, to date.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009053", "name" "Prefoldin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02996" "Prefoldin subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00293" "prefoldin subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prefoldin alpha-like", "short" "Prefoldin_subunit_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 241, "proteomes" 3005, "taxa" 11689, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16219, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16185, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11096}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004127", :literature {"PUB00013306" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Siegert R" "Leroux MR" "Scheufler C" "Hartl FU" "Moarefi I."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00165-3", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure of the molecular chaperone prefoldin: unique interaction of multiple coiled coil tentacles with unfolded proteins.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "621-32", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11106732}, "PUB00013187" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Martin-Benito J" "Boskovic J" "Gomez-Puertas P" "Carrascosa JL" "Simons CT" "Lewis SA" "Bartolini F" "Cowan NJ" "Valpuesta JM."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf640", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Structure of eukaryotic prefoldin and of its complexes with unfolded actin and the cytosolic chaperonin CCT.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "6377-86", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12456645}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004127", "name" "Prefoldin alpha-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003994", "name" "Ubiquitously expressed transcript protein UXT", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011599", "name" "Prefoldin alpha subunit, archaea-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016655", "name" "Prefoldin subunit 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 35, "alignment:full" 7671}}}
