{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sestrins (Sesns) are involved in ROS (reactive oxygen species) regulation. In mammals, there are three Sestrins (Sesn1, Sesn2, and Sesn3), while in Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans, there is only one Sesn [[cite:PUB00070250]]. The N-terminal of Sesns shares protein sequence and structural similarity with the C-terminal Î±-helical domain of the AhpD protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Interestingly, AhpD is a component of alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase participating in defense against ROS and ROS produced by host immune cells [[cite:PUB00026775]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12474" "P53 REGULATED PA26 NUCLEAR PROTEIN SESTRIN"}, "pfam" {"PF04636" "PA26 p53-induced protein (sestrin)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sestrin", "short" "Sestrin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 39, "proteomes" 1143, "taxa" 4411, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5496, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3478}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
