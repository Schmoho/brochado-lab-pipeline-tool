{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The FAM65 family of proteins includes the members FAM65A (also known as Rho family-interacting cell polarization regulator 1), FAM65B (also known as Rho family-interacting cell polarization regulator 2) and FAM65C (also known as RIPOR family member 3). FAM65A has been shown to localise to the podocyte major processes and cell body in the kidney [[cite:PUB00060093]]. FAM65B is upregulated early during muscle cell differentiation [[cite:PUB00060100]], and occurs in two isoforms, long and short, which are differentially expressed in different tissues. FAM65C also appears to occur in two isoforms, produced by alternative splicing.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15829" "PROTEIN KINASE PKN/PRK1, EFFECTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RIPOR family member 3", "short" "RIPOR3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 832, "taxa" 3024, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5259, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5259, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3115}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026136", :literature {"PUB00060093" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Patrakka J" "Xiao Z" "Nukui M" "Takemoto M" "He L" "Oddsson A" "Perisic L" "Kaukinen A" "Szigyarto CA" "Uhlen M" "Jalanko H" "Betsholtz C" "Tryggvason K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
