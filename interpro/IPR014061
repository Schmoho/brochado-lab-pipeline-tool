{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Lon-like protease BrxL from Bacillus cereus and similar proteins. BrxL is part of a type 1 BREX system. BREX systems (bacteriophage exclusion) provide immunity against bacteriophage, a system that allows phage adsorption but prevents phage DNA replication, without degradation of the phage DNA [[cite:PUB00093365]]. Methylation of bacterial DNA by PglX probably guides self/non-self discrimination. When the brxA-brxB-brxC-pglX and pglZ-brxL operons are transformed into a susceptible B.subtilis strain (BEST7003) they confer resistance to bacteriophages SPbeta, SP16, Zeta, phi3T and SP02 and partial protection to phages SP01 and SP82G (these include lytic and temperate phage). This entry also includes few uncharacterised viral proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13337" "Lon-like protease BrxL-like, ATPase domain"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02688" "BREX system Lon protease-like protein BrxL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lon-like protease BrxL-like", "short" "BrxL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 673, "taxa" 4850, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3531, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3530, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2751}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0472", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0472"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014061", :literature {"PUB00093365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Goldfarb T" "Sberro H" "Weinstock E" "Cohen O" "Doron S" "Charpak-Amikam Y" "Afik S" "Ofir G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "BREX is a novel phage resistance system widespread in microbial genomes.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "169-83", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25452498}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014061", "name" "Lon-like protease BrxL-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR013473", "name" "Lon-like protease BrxL", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 46, "alignment:full" 745}}}
