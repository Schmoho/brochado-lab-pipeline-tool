{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains bacteriophytochromes, or BphPs (light-regulated signal transduction histidine kinases) with the receiver (CheY-like) domain fused at the C terminus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phytochrome dimeric photoreceptors regulate growth and development by sensing ambient light [[cite:PUB00013647]]. Apart from phytochromes in photosynthetic organisms, phytochrome-like photoreceptors have been found in several nonphotosynthetic organisms, including in the heterotrophic eubacteria Deinococcus radiodurans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, [cite:PUB00013648]]. These homodimeric photoreceptors sense red light (R) and far-red light (FR) through photointerconversion between two stable conformations, a R-absorbing Pr form and a FR-absorbing Pfr form [[cite:PUB00013649]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phytochromes in general contain a signature N-terminal chromophore-binding region (CBD) that includes GAF and PHY domains, both of which are essential for autocatalytically binding bilin chromophores. A C-terminal module is involved in signal transduction and homodimerisation, and is different in different groups of phytochromes. Phytochromes are divided into three groups: plant phys, cyanobacterial phys (Cphs), and bacteriophytochrome photoreceptors (BphPs) [[cite:PUB00013649]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BphPs are common among photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic Eubacteria and present in some fungi [[cite:PUB00013650]]. They act as photoregulated kinases that presumably initiate the phosphorelay cascade by phosphotransfer to an associated response regulator (RR). In some cases, the receiver (CheY-like) domain of this RR is fused to the C-terminal end of the BphP (such hybrid proteins are in this entry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Cphs, BphPs often contain the canonical two-component histidine kinase motif and act as histidine kinases in vitro. The main distinction is that they use the bilin biliverdin (BV) as the chromophore [[cite:PUB00013650]]. Included in the CBD are the positionally conserved cysteine (Cys-20 and Cys-13) and histidine (His-250 and His-248) residues that could serve as the chromophore-binding site, by using either a thiolether or Schiff-base-type linkage, respectively [[cite:PUB00013650], [cite:PUB00013651], [cite:PUB00013648], [cite:PUB00013649]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029016", "name" "GAF-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036397" "Predicted bacteriophytochrome with receiver domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophytochrome, CheY-like", "short" "Bactrphtchr_CheY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 315, "taxa" 1099, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 965, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 761}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009219", :literature {"PUB00013647" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5211", "authors" ["Quail PH" "Boylan MT" "Parks BM" "Short TW" "Xu Y" "Wagner D."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/268/5211/675", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Phytochromes: photosensory perception and signal transduction.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "675-80", "volume" "268", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7732376}, "PUB00013648" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5449", "authors" ["Davis SJ" "Vener AV" "Vierstra RD."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.286.5449.2517", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Bacteriophytochromes: phytochrome-like photoreceptors from nonphotosynthetic eubacteria.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "2517-20", "volume" "286", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10617469}, "PUB00013649" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Karniol B" "Vierstra RD."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
