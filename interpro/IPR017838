{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The DMSO reductase family is a large and rapidly expanding group of enzymes found in bacteria and archaea that share a common form of molybdenum cofactor known as bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)Mo [[cite:PUB00042994]]. This entry represents a haem b-binding subunit, typically called the gamma subunit, found in various type II DMSO reductase family enzymes that, in addition to the molybdopterin subunit also contain an iron-sulphur subunit. These include two distinct but very closely related periplasmic proteins of anaerobic respiration: selenate reductase and chlorate reductase [[cite:PUB00042991]]. Other proteins containing this subunit include dimethyl sulphide dehydrogenase and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00042992], [cite:PUB00042993], [cite:PUB00045286]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ivf", "name" "Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase from Aromatoleum aromaticum"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09623" "Heme-binding domain of bacterial ethylbenzene dehydrogenase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03477" "DMSO reductase family type II enzyme, heme b subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DMSO reductase family, type II, haem b-binding subunit", "short" "DMSO_Rdtase_II_haem_b-bd_su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 54, "taxa" 473, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 272, "sets" 0, "proteins" 272, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 232}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0764", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0764"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
