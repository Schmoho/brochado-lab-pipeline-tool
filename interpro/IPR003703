{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acyl-CoA thioesterases are a group of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and coenzyme A (CoASH). They consequently have the potential to regulate intracellular levels of acyl-CoAs, free fatty acids and CoASH. They may also be involved in the metabolic regulation of peroxisome proliferation.</p>\n\n<p>This family includes Acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 from gammaproteobacteria [[cite:PUB00008184]], Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 8 from mammals [[cite:PUB00057420]], Peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A thioester hydrolase 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00016113]] and Acyl-CoA hydrolase 1/2 from Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00100264], [cite:PUB00100263]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4qfw", "name" "Crystal structure of acyl-CoA thioesterase tesB from Yersinia pestis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029069", "name" "HotDog domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042171", "name" "Acyl-CoA thioesterase, double hotdog domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11066" "ACYL-COA THIOESTERASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00189" "acyl-CoA thioesterase II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl-CoA thioesterase", "short" "Acyl_CoA_thio"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5723, "taxa" 19808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26433, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26433, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19585}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1488", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1488"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
