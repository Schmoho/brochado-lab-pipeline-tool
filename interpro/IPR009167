{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of receptors for lymphokines, hematopoietic growth factors and growth hormone-related molecules have been found to share a common binding domain. These receptors are designated as hematopoietin receptors [[cite:PUB00006640]] and the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been subdivided into two major structural groups: Large/long and small/short hematopoietins.</p>\n\n<p>Several receptor chains for large hematopoietins are structurally related such that their extracellular parts strictly contain the 200 amino-acids hematopoietin domain, duplicated in the thrombopoietin receptor and in avian prolactin receptors. This subgroup of receptor chains contains: Growth hormone receptor (GHR), Prolactin receptor (PRLR), Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), Thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR).</p>\n\n<p>A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below:</p>\n\n<pre>\n +----------------------------------------xxxxxxx-------------------------+\n | C C       C  C  Extracellular          XXXXXXX       Cytoplasmic       |\n +-|-|-------|--|-------------------------xxxxxxx-------------------------+\n   | |       |  |                      Transmembrane\n   +-+       +--+\n</pre>\n\n<p>These receptor chains are single components of receptors that homodimerise upon binding of the cognate cytokine, following the structural model described for the growth hormone-receptor complex [[cite:PUB00006639]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry describes receptors for erythropoietin (EPO), a plasma glycoprotein, which is the primary physiological mediator of erythrocite production [[cite:PUB00003648]]. They are expressed in relatively mature erythroid progenitor cells and in EPO-responsive erythroleukemia cells, and their physiological role is to mediate erythropoietin-induced erythroblast proliferation and differentiation. The receptors dimerise upon stimulation, triggering the JAK2/STAT5 signalling cascade [[cite:PUB00020723], [cite:PUB00020724]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001959" "Erythropoietin receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Erythropoietin receptor", "short" "Erythropoietin_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 240, "taxa" 999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 613, "sets" 0, "proteins" 402, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 246}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009167", :literature {"PUB00006640" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Boulay JL" "Paul WE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
