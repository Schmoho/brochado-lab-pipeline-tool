{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic eIF-5A was initially thought to function as a translation initiation factor, based on its ability to stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis. However, subsequent work revealed a role for eIF5A in translation elongation [[cite:PUB00046010], [cite:PUB00090482]]. Depletion or inactivation of eIF-5A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) resulted in the accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times. Addition of recombinant eIF-5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover, inactivation of eIF-5A mimicked the effects of the eEF2 inhibitor sordarin, indicating that eIF-5A might function together with eEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Finally, it was shown that eIF5A is specifically required to promote peptide-bond formation between consecutive proline residues. It has been proposed to stimulate the peptidyl-transferase activity of the ribosome and facilitate the reactivity of poor substrates like proline [[cite:PUB00082267]].</p>\n\n<p>eIF-5A is a cofactor for the Rev and Rex transactivator proteins of human immunodeficiency virus-1 and T-cell leukaemia virus I, respectively [[cite:PUB00000742], [cite:PUB00003672], [cite:PUB00010716]]. IF-5A is the sole protein in eukaryotes and archaea to contain the unusual amino acid hypusine (Ne-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) that is an absolute functional requirement. The first step in the post-translational modification of lysine to hypusine is catalyzed by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase, the structure of which has been reported [[cite:PUB00005808]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the archaeal IF-5A proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8put", "name" "IF5A in complex with Deoxyhypusine synthase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008991", "name" "Translation protein SH3-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR014722", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein uL2, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00085" "Translation initiation factor 5A [eif5a]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translation elongation factor IF5A, archaeal", "short" "Transl_elong_IF5A_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 281, "taxa" 1969, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2255, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1936}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022847", :literature {"PUB00010716" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Peat TS" "Newman J" "Waldo GS" "Berendzen J" "Terwilliger TC."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(98)00120-8", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure of translation initiation factor 5A from Pyrobaculum aerophilum at 1.75 A resolution.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "1207-14", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9753699}, "PUB00003672" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Schnier J" "Schwelberger HG" "Smit-McBride Z" "Kang HA" "Hershey JW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
