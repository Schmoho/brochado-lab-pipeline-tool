{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pectate lyase is responsible for the maceration and soft-rotting of plant tissue. It catalyses the eliminative cleavage of pectate to produce oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. Pectate lyase is an extracellular enzyme and is induced by pectin. It is subject to self-catabolite repression, and has been implicated in plant disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents a group of pectate lyases, including PlyE and PlyH from Aspergillus nidulans [[cite:PUB00079200]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3t9g", "name" "The crystal structure of family 3 pectate lyase from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011050", "name" "Pectin lyase fold/virulence factor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012334", "name" "Pectin lyase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33407" "PECTATE LYASE F-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03211" "Pectate lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pectate lyase PlyH/PlyE-like", "short" "Pectate_lyase_PlyH/PlyE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 82, "proteomes" 989, "taxa" 3170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7227, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7002, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4320}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
