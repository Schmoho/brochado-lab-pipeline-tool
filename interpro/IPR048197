{:metadata {:description [{"text" "Streptomyces papain inhibitor (SPI) adopts a rigid, thermo-resistant double-psi-Î²-barrel (DPBB) fold that is stabilized by two cysteine bridges. SPI serves as a glutamine and lysine donor substrate for microbial transglutaminase (MTG, [ec:2.3.2.13]) from Streptomycetes, that is used to covalently and specifically link functional amines to glutamine donor sites of therapeutic proteins. SPI is a stress protein produced under hyperthermal stress conditions, and is able to inhibit the cysteine proteases, papain and bromelain, as well as the bovine serine protease trypsin [[cite:PUB00146810], [cite:PUB00146811], [cite:PUB00011777]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ntb", "name" "Streptomyces papain inhibitor (SPI)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036908", "name" "RlpA-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041659" "cysteine/serine endopeptidase inhibitor"}, "cdd" {"cd22273" "double-psi beta-barrel fold of Streptomyces papain inhibitor and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Papain inhibitor", "short" "Papain_inhib"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 239, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 184, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 107}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048197", :literature {"PUB00011777" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Castillo RM" "Mizuguchi K" "Dhanaraj V" "Albert A" "Blundell TL" "Murzin AG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80028-8", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "A six-stranded double-psi beta barrel is shared by several protein superfamilies.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "227-36", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10368289}, "PUB00146810" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Juettner NE" "Schmelz S" "Bogen JP" "Happel D" "Fessner WD" "Pfeifer F" "Fuchsbauer HL" "Scrima A."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Illuminating structure and acyl donor sites of a physiological transglutaminase substrate from Streptomyces mobaraensis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "910-922", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29430769}, "PUB00146811" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sarafeddinov A" "Arif A" "Peters A" "Fuchsbauer HL."], "ISO_journal" "J Microbiol Biotechnol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Microbiol Biotechnol", "title" "A novel transglutaminase substrate from Streptomyces mobaraensis inhibiting papain-like cysteine proteases.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "617-26", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21715969}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0004867", "name" "serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0004869", "name" "cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048197", "name" "Papain inhibitor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
