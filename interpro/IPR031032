{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this Gram-positive bacteria family consist of an N-terminal signal peptide, a central region of unknown function, and a Cys-rich C-terminal region. In both the overall architecture and the apparent weak homology of the C-terminal region itself, these proteins resemble archaeal proteins such as the halocin C8 precursor. In that precursor, the C-terminal region is a bacteriocin but the N-terminal region functions as the immunity protein. The related family of halocin C8-like bacteriocins and their bacterial homologues can be found in the halocin C8-like bacteriocin domain entry ([interpro:IPR031033]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04450" "putative immunity/bacteriocin fusion bifunctional protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative immunity protein/bacteriocin", "short" "Gpos_C8-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 78, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031032", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031032", "name" "Putative immunity protein/bacteriocin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
