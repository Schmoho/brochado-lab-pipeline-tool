{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents yeast Vta1 and its homologues from animals and plants. Vta1 interacts with the AAA ATPase Vps4 and is required for multivesicular body (MVB) sorting [[cite:PUB00096379], [cite:PUB00044969]]. This entry also includes LIP5 from Arabidopsis. LIP5 is a positive regulator of the Suppressor of K(+) Transport Growth Defect1 (SKD1) AAA ATPase in MVB biogenesis. It is also a target of pathogen-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) and plays a critical role in plant basal resistance [[cite:PUB00096380], [cite:PUB00096381]]. Mammalian Vta1 homologue functions in MVB sorting and is required for HIV release [[cite:PUB00096382]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4txr", "name" "Crystal structure of LIP5 N-terminal domain complexed with CHMP1B MIM and CHMP5 MIM"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46009" "VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN VTA1 HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein Vta1-like", "short" "Vta1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2511, "taxa" 8593, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4764, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4764, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3123}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044538", :literature {"PUB00096382" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ward DM" "Vaughn MB" "Shiflett SL" "White PL" "Pollock AL" "Hill J" "Schnegelberger R" "Sundquist WI" "Kaplan J."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The role of LIP5 and CHMP5 in multivesicular body formation and HIV-1 budding in mammalian cells.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "10548-55", "volume" "280", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15644320}, "PUB00096379" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 19", "authors" ["Yeo SC" "Xu L" "Ren J" "Boulton VJ" "Wagle MD" "Liu C" "Ren G" "Wong P" "Zahn R" "Sasajala P" "Yang H" "Piper RC" "Munn AL."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Sci", "title" "Vps20p and Vta1p interact with Vps4p and function in multivesicular body sorting and endosomal transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "3957-70", "volume" "116", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12953057}, "PUB00096380" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wang F" "Shang Y" "Fan B" "Yu JQ" "Chen Z."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Arabidopsis LIP5, a positive regulator of multivesicular body biogenesis, is a critical target of pathogen-responsive MAPK cascade in plant basal defense.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e1004243", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25010425}, "PUB00096381" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang F" "Yang Y" "Wang Z" "Zhou J" "Fan B" "Chen Z."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "A Critical Role of Lyst-Interacting Protein5, a Positive Regulator of Multivesicular Body Biogenesis, in Plant Responses to Heat and Salt Stresses.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "497-511", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26229051}, "PUB00044969" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Azmi I" "Davies B" "Dimaano C" "Payne J" "Eckert D" "Babst M" "Katzmann DJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
