{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutamate mutase (methylaspartate mutase) catalyses the reversible interconversion of L-glutamate and L-threo-3-methylaspartate, the first step in the pathway of glutamate fermentation [[cite:PUB00034444]]. Catalysis is initiated using the cobalamin cofactor. The E subunit is the catalytic subunit (MutE) [[cite:PUB00034445]]. The first step in the catalysis is a homolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond of the coenzyme B12 cofactor to generate a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. This radical then initiates the rearrangement reaction [[cite:PUB00014831]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry includes proteins similar to Clostridium cochlearium glutamate mutase (Glm) and Streptomyces tendae Tu901 NikV. Glm catalyzes a carbon-skeleton rearrangement of L-glutamate to L-threo-3-methylaspartate. C. cochlearium Glm is a sigma2epsilon2 heterotetramer. Glm plays a role in glutamate fermentation in Clostridium sp. and in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and in the synthesis of the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin in Actinoplanes friuliensis [[cite:PUB00080451]]. S. tendae Tu901 glutamate mutase-like proteins NikU and NIkV participate in the synthesis of the peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin. NikU and NikV proteins have sequence similarity to Clostridium Glm sigma and epsilon components respectively, and may catalyze the rearrangement of 2-oxoglutaric acid to 2-keto-3-methylsuccinic acid during nikkomycin synthesis [[cite:PUB00080454]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ccw", "name" "STRUCTURE OF THE COENZYME B12 DEPENDENT ENZYME GLUTAMATE MUTASE FROM CLOSTRIDIUM COCHLEARIUM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016176", "name" "Cobalamin (vitamin B12)-dependent enzyme, catalytic", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR014714", "name" "Glutamate mutase E subunit, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00245" "Glm_e"}, "pfam" {"PF06368" "Methylaspartate mutase E chain (MutE)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001495" "Methylaspartate mutase, epsilon subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01503" "methylaspartate mutase subunit E"}, "hamap" {"MF_01923" "Glutamate mutase epsilon subunit [glmE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamate mutase epsilon subunit", "short" "Glu_mut_E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 522, "taxa" 2567, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2309, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1734}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
