{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins mainly found in animals that contain the NUDIX hydrolase domain, including U8 snoRNA -decapping enzyme NudT16 [[cite:PUB00154127]]. NudT16 was initially described as an RNA-binding and decapping enzyme but it was later reported to be specialised in the removal of hazardous (deoxy)inosine diphosphate from the nucleotide pool. It adopts a canonical NUDIX fold, an α-β-α sandwich constituted by two β-sheets whose strands interact in a way that could also be described as a single extended β-sheet [[cite:PUB00154125]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3mgm", "name" "Crystal structure of human NUDT16"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22327" "U8 snoRNA-decapping enzyme-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR31699" "NUDIX T16 FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "U8 snoRNA-decapping enzyme NudT16", "short" "NudT16"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 651, "taxa" 2741, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1502, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1455, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 926}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
