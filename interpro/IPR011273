{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase found in plants, mosses and green algae and localised to the chloroplast.  Malate dehydrogenase converts oxaloacetate into malate, a critical step in the C4 cycle which allows circumvention of the effects of photorespiration.  Malate is subsequently transported from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm (and then to the bundle sheath cells in C4 plants).  The plant and moss enzymes are light regulated via cysteine diisulphide bonds.  The enzyme from sorghum has been crystallised [[cite:PUB00013757]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01757" "malate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Malate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent, plants", "short" "Malate_DH_NADP-dep_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1086, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 630, "sets" 0, "proteins" 629, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 395}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
