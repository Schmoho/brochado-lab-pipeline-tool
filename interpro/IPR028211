{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the pre-mRNA-splicing factor Ntr2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ntr1 and Ntr2 (nineTeen complex-Related proteins) formed a stable complex with DExD/H-box RNA helicase Prp43, which is involved in disassembly of the spliceosome and release of the excised intron in its branched, lariat form [[cite:PUB00067694]].  Ntr1 is required for the association of Prp43 with the excised intron complex prior to its release and recycling of the splicing factors [[cite:PUB00054039]]. Ntr2 can associate with late splicing complexes independently of Ntr1 but is not by itself sufficient to activate the intron release function of Prp43 [[cite:PUB00067694]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15458" "Nineteen complex-related protein 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor Ntr2", "short" "Ntr2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 29, "proteomes" 1420, "taxa" 4697, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2265, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2246, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1355}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028211", :literature {"PUB00054039" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Tsai RT" "Fu RH" "Yeh FL" "Tseng CK" "Lin YC" "Huang YH" "Cheng SC."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1377405", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Spliceosome disassembly catalyzed by Prp43 and its associated components Ntr1 and Ntr2.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2991-3003", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16357217}, "PUB00067694" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Boon KL" "Auchynnikava T" "Edwalds-Gilbert G" "Barrass JD" "Droop AP" "Dez C" "Beggs JD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
