{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Wall-associated teichoic acids are a heterogeneous class of phosphate-rich polymers that are covalently linked to the cell wall peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria. They consist of a main chain of phosphodiester-linked polyols and/or sugar moieties attached to peptidoglycan via a linkage unit. CDP-glycerol:poly(glycerophosphate) glycerophosphotransferase TagF is responsible for the polymerisation of the main chain of the teichoic acid by sequential transfer of glycerol-phosphate units from CDP-glycerol to the linkage unit lipid [[cite:PUB00010019]]. The TagF-like family of enzymes has been shown to be responsible for wall teichoic acid priming and polymerization events [[cite:PUB00083232], [cite:PUB00083233]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043149", "name" "CDP-glycerol glycerophosphotransferase, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04464" "CDP-Glycerol:Poly(glycerophosphate) glycerophosphotransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CDP-glycerol glycerophosphotransferase", "short" "Glycerophosphate_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 193, "proteomes" 2391, "taxa" 10125, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15695}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1756", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1756"} {"accession" "GenProp1398", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1398"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
