{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This gene has been characterised in Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00016396]] as the molybdopterin binding-subunit of xanthine dehydrogenase (pucD), acting in conjunction with pucC, the FAD-binding subunit and pucE, the FeS-binding subunit. The more common XDH complex ([genprop:GenProp0640]) includes the xdhB gene which is related to pucD. It appears that most of the relatives of pucD outside of this narrow clade are involved in other processes as they are found in unrelated genomic contexts, contain the more common XDH complex and/or do not appear to process purines to allantoin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037165", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, molybdopterin binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03196" "xanthine dehydrogenase subunit D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Xanthine dehydrogenase D subunit", "short" "Xanthine_dehydrogenase_dsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 454, "taxa" 1294, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 996}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0705", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0705"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
