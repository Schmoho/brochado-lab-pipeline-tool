{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The chromosomal passenger complex of Aurora B kinase, INCENP, and Survivin has essential regulatory roles at centromeres and the central spindle in mitosis. Cell division cycle-associated protein 8, also known as Borealin, is also a member of the complex. Approximately half of Aurora B in mitotic cells is complexed with INCENP, Borealin, and Survivin [[cite:PUB00048322]]. Depletion of Borealin by RNA interference delays mitotic progression and results in kinetochore-spindle mis-attachments and an increase in bipolar spindles associated with ectopic asters [[cite:PUB00044173]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6yif", "name" "Structure of Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) bound to phosphorylated Histone 3 peptide at 1.8 A."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16040" "AUSTRALIN, ISOFORM A-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein borealin", "short" "Cell_div_borealin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1613, "taxa" 5425, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3234, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2217}, "pathways" 29}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018867", :literature {"PUB00044173" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Gassmann R" "Carvalho A" "Henzing AJ" "Ruchaud S" "Hudson DF" "Honda R" "Nigg EA" "Gerloff DL" "Earnshaw WC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
