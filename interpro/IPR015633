{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The E2F family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle [[cite:PUB00096666], [cite:PUB00096667]] and action of tumour suppressor proteins. This family consists of eight members and is divided into activators (E2F1-3) and repressors (E2F4-8) depending on cellular context, target gene and cofactors [[cite:PUB00096666]]. The E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains found in most members of the family. These domains include a DNA-binding domain, a dimerisation domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumour suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain [[cite:PUB00008097]]. Classical E2Fs (E2F1-6) contain one DNA-binding domain which form heterodimers with DP proteins; atypical family members, E2F7 and E2F8, possess two DNA-binding domains, form homodimers or heterodimers, thus regulating transcription in a DP-independent manner [[cite:PUB00096666]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12081" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR E2F"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E2F Family", "short" "E2F"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1504, "taxa" 5952, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13233, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13233, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8775}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015633", :literature {"PUB00008097" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Wu CL" "Zukerberg LR" "Ngwu C" "Harlow E" "Lees JA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
