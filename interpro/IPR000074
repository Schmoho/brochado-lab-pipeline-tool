{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Exchangeable apolipoproteins (apoA, apoC and apoE) have the same genomic structure and are members of a multi-gene family that probably evolved from a common ancestral gene. This entry includes the ApoA1, ApoA4, Apo5 and ApoE proteins. ApoA1, ApoA4 and Apo5 are part of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster on chromosome 11 [[cite:PUB00015448]]. Apolipoproteins function in lipid transport as structural components of lipoprotein particles, cofactors for enzymes and ligands for cell-surface receptors. In particular, apoA1 is the major protein component of high-density lipoproteins; apoA4 is thought to act primarily in intestinal lipid absorption; and apoE is a blood plasma protein that mediates the transport and uptake of cholesterol and lipid by way of its high affinity interaction with different cellular receptors, including the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Recent findings with apoA1 and apoE suggest that the tertiary structures of these two members of the human exchangeable apolipoprotein gene family are related [[cite:PUB00015449]]. The three-dimensional structure of the LDL receptor-binding domain of apoE indicates that the protein forms an unusually elongated four-helix bundle that may be stabilised by a tightly packed hydrophobic core that includes leucine zipper-type interactions and by numerous salt bridges on the mostly charged surface. Basic amino acids important for LDL receptor binding are clustered into a surface patch on one long helix [[cite:PUB00005140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6v7m", "name" "Crystal structure of a proteolytically cleaved, amino terminal domain of apolipoprotein E3"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01442" "Apolipoprotein A1/A4/E domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apolipoprotein A/E", "short" "ApoA_E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 51, "domain_architectures" 190, "proteomes" 1174, "taxa" 4789, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5775, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2693}, "pathways" 86}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000074", :literature {"PUB00015449" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Saito H" "Lund-Katz S" "Phillips MC."], "ISO_journal" "Prog.
