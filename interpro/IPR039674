{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CASP8-associated protein 2 (CASP8AP2), also known as FLASH, is involved in various cellular functions, such as cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, the regulation of apoptosis, and the regulation of histone gene expression [[cite:PUB00089951]]. It is an essential component of Cajal bodies and is involved in the apoptosis receptor signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00089950]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FLASH contains the N terminus required for histone pre-mRNA processing, the C-terminal segment which forms a SANT/Myb-like domain, and a small central region which binds Ars2 essential for cell cycle progression [[cite:PUB00089952]].
