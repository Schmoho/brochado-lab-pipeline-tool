{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PTPRO, also known as GLEPP1, is a receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing an extracellular region that contains eight fibronectin FN III repeats and a single intracellular catalytic domain. GLEPP1 plays a role in axonal guidance [[cite:PUB00093580]], promotes osteoclastic bone resorption [[cite:PUB00093581]], mediates chemotaxis [[cite:PUB00093578]] and can act as a tumour suppressor [[cite:PUB00093579]]. Besides \"full-length\" GLEPP1, which is expressed in kidney and brain, a shorter variant exists that lacks the eight FN III repeats in the extracellular domain, called PTPROt, PTPphi, or PTP-oc, and is expressed in the hematopoietic lineage only, including osteoclasts [[cite:PUB00093577]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47028" "RECEPTOR-TYPE TYROSINE-PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE O"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase O", "short" "PTPRO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 602, "taxa" 2060, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1474, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1474, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 894}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
