{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lipoic acid is an organosulphur compound that is an essential coenzyme in several multienzyme complexes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and the glycine cleavage system. Many Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, require three proteins for lipoic acid cofactor biosynthesis: LipJ, LipL and LipM [[cite:PUB00056769], [cite:PUB00056770]]. LipM is a lipoate:protein ligase that transfers an octanoyl moiety from acyl-carrier protein to the GcvH protein of the glycine cleavage system. LipL, an octanoyltransferase, then transfers this moiety from GcvH to other enzyme complexes. LipA inserts the sulphur group to form the active lipoate cofactor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the LipM component of this system.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045864", "name" "Class II Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/Biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) and lipoyl protein ligase (LPL)", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02118" "Octanoyltransferase LipM [lipM]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Octanoyltransferase LipM", "short" "LipM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 253, "taxa" 988, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 694}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
