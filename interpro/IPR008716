{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The nodulation genes of Rhizobia are regulated by the nodD gene product in response to host-produced flavonoids and appear to encode enzymes involved in the production of a lipo-chitose signal molecule required for infection and nodule formation. NodZ is required for the addition of a 2-O-methylfucose residue to the terminal reducing N-acetylglucosamine of the nodulation signal. This substitution is essential for the biological activity of this molecule. Mutations in nodZ result in defective nodulation. nodZ represents a unique nodulation gene that is not under the control of NodD and yet is essential for the synthesis of an active nodulation signal [[cite:PUB00011402]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hhc", "name" "Crystal structure of fucosyltransferase NodZ from Bradyrhizobium"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05830" "Nodulation protein Z (NodZ)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF020513" "6-alpha fucosyltransferase, NodZ type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nodulation protein Z", "short" "NodZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 54, "taxa" 1071, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 877, "sets" 0, "proteins" 875, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 806}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
