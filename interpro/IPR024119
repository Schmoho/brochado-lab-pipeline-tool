{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (DEAF-1) was first isolated in Drosophila melanogaster as a novel DNA-binding protein [[cite:PUB00001283]]. Since then, several orthologues in mammals have been identified. In Drosophila, DEAF-1 plays an important role in embryonic development, particularly in the segmentation stage following cuticle secretion. In mammals it regulates different processes, including epithelial cell proliferation and side-branching in the mammary gland [[cite:PUB00055451]] and it is required for neural tube closure and skeletal patterning [[cite:PUB00055452], [cite:PUB00155078]]. Mutations in DEAF-1 cause intellectual disability and behavioural problems, most likely as a result of impaired transcriptional regulation by DEAF1 [[cite:PUB00155078]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10237" "DEFORMED EPIDERMAL AUTOREGULATORY FACTOR 1 HOMOLOG SUPPRESSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor DEAF-1", "short" "TF_DEAF-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1456, "taxa" 5262, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3792, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3792, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2221}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024119", :literature {"PUB00055451" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Barker HE" "Smyth GK" "Wettenhall J" "Ward TA" "Bath ML" "Lindeman GJ" "Visvader JE."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Dev.
