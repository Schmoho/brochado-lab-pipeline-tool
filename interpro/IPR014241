{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacterial-type cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CtaD, CoxA, CaaA). Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyses the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits I, II and III form the functional core of the enzyme complex. Subunit I is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Electrons originating in cytochrome c are transferred via the copper A centre of subunit II and haem A of subunit I to the bimetallic centre formed by haem A3 and copper B. This cytochrome c oxidase shows proton pump activity across the membrane in addition to the electron transfer activity. In the bacilli an apparent split (paralogism) has created a sister clade ([interpro:IPR014233]) encoding subunits (QoxA) of the aa3-type quinone oxidase complex which reacts directly with quinones, bypassing the interaction with soluble cytochrome c.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2gsm", "name" "Catalytic Core (Subunits I and II) of Cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036927", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase-like, subunit I superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02891" "cytochrome c oxidase subunit I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I bacterial type", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_su1_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 36, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5272, "taxa" 21543, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27529, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21593}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0614", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0614"} {"accession" "GenProp1637", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1637"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
