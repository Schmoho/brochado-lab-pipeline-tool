{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is found in Trypanosome species, and appears to be one of two invariant surface glycoproteins, ISG65 and ISG75, that are found in the mammalian stage of the parasitic protozoan. The sequence suggests the two families are polypeptides with N-terminal signal sequences, hydrophilic extracellular domains, single trans-membrane Î±-helices and short cytoplasmic domains. They are both expressed in the bloodstream form but not in the midgut stage. Both polypeptides are distributed over the entire surface of the parasite [[cite:PUB00053315], [cite:PUB00053316]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11727" "Invariant surface glycoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trypanosome invariant surface glycoprotein", "short" "Trypano_invariant_glycop"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 102, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 259, "sets" 0, "proteins" 259, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 244}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021057", :literature {"PUB00053315" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Ziegelbauer K" "Multhaup G" "Overath P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
