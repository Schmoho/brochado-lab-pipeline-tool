{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SETD2 is a histone methyltransferase that specifically trimethylates 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3) using dimethylated 'Lys-36' (H3K36me2) as substrate [[cite:PUB00033707], [cite:PUB00092844]]. It is required for DNA double-strand break repair and activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint [[cite:PUB00092845]]. SETD2-inactivation has been linked to tumour development [[cite:PUB00092846]]. SETD2 also methylates alpha-tubulin at lysine 40, the same lysine that is marked by acetylation on microtubules. Methylation of microtubules occurs during mitosis and cytokinesis and can be ablated by SETD2 deletion, which causes mitotic spindle and cytokinesis defects, micronuclei, and polyploidy [[cite:PUB00096040]].  Moreover, SETD2 is also involved in interferon-alpha-induced antiviral defense by mediating both monomethylation of STAT1 at 'Lys-525' and catalyzing H3K36me3 on promoters of some interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to activate gene transcription [[cite:PUB00096042]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6j9j", "name" "crystal structure of SESTD2 in complex with H3.3S31phK36M peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46711" "HISTONE-LYSINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE SETD2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2, animal", "short" "SETD2_animal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 945, "taxa" 3840, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2452, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 534}, "pathways" 147}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
