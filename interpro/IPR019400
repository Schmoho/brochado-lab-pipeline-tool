{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is a highly specific ubiquitin iso-peptidase that removes ubiquitin from proteins [[cite:PUB00045069]]. The modification of cellular proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) is an important event that underlies protein stability and function in eukaryotes, as it is a dynamic and reversible process. Otubain carries several key conserved domains: (i) the OTU (ovarian tumour domain) in which there is an active cysteine protease triad (ii) a nuclear localisation signal, (iii) a Ub interaction motif (UIM)-like motif phi-xx-A-xxxs-xx-Ac (where phi indicates an aromatic amino acid, x indicates any amino acid and Ac indicates an acidic amino acid), (iv) a Ub-associated (UBA)-like domain and (v) the LxxLL motif [[cite:PUB00063614]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5qix", "name" "Covalent fragment group deposition -- Crystal Structure of OUTB2 in complex with PCM-0103007"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038765", "name" "Papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042467", "name" "Peptidase C65, otubain, subdomain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042468", "name" "Peptidase C65, otubain, subdomain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10275" "Peptidase C65 Otubain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase C65, otubain", "short" "Peptidase_C65_otubain"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 86, "proteomes" 2217, "taxa" 9110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6235, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3666}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
