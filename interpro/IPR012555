{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the major transforming proteins (E5) of the bovine papilloma virus (BPV). The equine sarcoid is one of the most common dermatological lesion in equids. It is a benign, locally invasive dermal fibroblastic lesion and studies have shown an association of the lesions with BPV. E5 is a short hydrophobic membrane protein localising to the Golgi apparatus and other intracellular membranes. It binds to and constitutively activates the platelet-derived growth factor-beta in transformed cells. This stimulation activates a receptor signalling cascade which results in an intracellular growth stimulatory signal [[cite:PUB00016416]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08135" "Major transforming protein E5 family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003401" "Transforming protein E5, Papillomavirus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major transforming E5", "short" "EPV_E5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012555", :literature {"PUB00016416" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Chambers G" "Ellsmore VA" "O'Brien PM" "Reid SW" "Love S" "Campo MS" "Nasir L."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1702(03)00175-8", "medline_journal" "Virus Res", "title" "Sequence variants of bovine papillomavirus E5 detected in equine sarcoids.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "141-5", "volume" "96", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12951274}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012555", "name" "Major transforming E5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 8}}}
