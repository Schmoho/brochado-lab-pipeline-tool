{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>O-Glycosyl hydrolases family 29 ([cazy:GH29]) encompasses alpha-L-fucosidases ([ec:3.2.1.51]) [[cite:PUB00000482]], which is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for hydrolysing the alpha-1,6-linked fucose joined to the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins. Alpha-L-fucosidase is responsible for hydrolysing the alpha-1,6-linked fucose joined to the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins.</p>\n\n<p>Fucosylated glycoconjugates are involved in numerous biological events, making alpha-l-fucosidases, the enzymes responsible for their processing, critically important. Deficiency in alpha-l-fucosidase activity is associated with fucosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by rapid neurodegeneration, resulting in severe mental and motor deterioration [[cite:PUB00021761]]. The enzyme is a hexamer and displays a two-domain fold, composed of a catalytic (β/α)(8)-like domain and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain [[cite:PUB00021761]].</p>\n\n<p>Drosophila melanogaster spermatozoa contains an alpha-l-fucosidase that might be involved in fertilisation by interacting with alpha-l-fucose residues on the micropyle of the eggshell [[cite:PUB00043486]]. In human sperm, membrane-associated alpha-l-fucosidase is stable for extended periods of time, which is made possible by membrane domains and compartmentalisation. These help preserve protein integrity [[cite:PUB00043487]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of alpha-L-fucosidases found in metazoa, fungi and bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4j27", "name" "Crystal structure of a gh29 alpha-l-fucosidase gh29 from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in a novel crystal form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001092" "Alpha-L-fucosidase"}, "prints" {"PR00741" "GLHYDRLASE29"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-L-fucosidase, metazoa-type", "short" "FUC_metazoa-typ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 58, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3186, "taxa" 12516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42270, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22717, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16459}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
