{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The RbcX protein has been identified as having a chaperonin-like function as it assists in the correct assembly of RbcL and RbcS subunits during RuBisCO biogenesis and it is also required to reach its maximal activity [[cite:PUB00009493], [cite:PUB00095596]]. The rbcX gene is juxtaposed to and cotranscribed with rbcL and rbcS encoding RubisCO in Anabaena sp. (strain CA / ATCC 33047) [[cite:PUB00009494]]. Crystal structure studies revealed that RbcX is composed almost exclusively of Î±-helices, which form an unusual four-helix bundle. Additionally, all known RbcX proteins exist as homodimers (RbcX2). The central cleft of this homodimer binds the C-terminal of a RbcL monomer, stabilizing it, and the peripheral region of RbcX2 binds a second RbcL monomer, which allows the RbcL homodimers to be in the correct orientation [[cite:PUB00095597]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gr2", "name" "Structure of AtRbcX1 from Arabidopsis thaliana."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038052", "name" "Chaperonin-like RbcX superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33791" "CHAPERONIN-LIKE RBCX PROTEIN 1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "pfam" {"PF02341" "RbcX protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperonin-like RbcX", "short" "Chaperonin_RcbX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 453, "taxa" 4157, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4069, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4058, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3216}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003435", :literature {"PUB00009493" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Rudi K" "Skulberg OM" "Jakobsen KS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
