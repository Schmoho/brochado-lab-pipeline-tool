{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes carbamoyl dehydratase HypE (sometimes known as hydrogenase maturation protein HypE or HupE) which is involved in the maturation of [NiFe] hydrogenases. Along with HypF, it catalyzes the synthesis of the CN ligands of the active site iron of [NiFe]-hydrogenases [[cite:PUB00088186], [cite:PUB00080736]]. HypE dehydrates its own carbamoyl moiety in an ATP-dependent process to yield the enzyme thiocyanate. The N-terminal domain of HypE is related to the ATP-binding domains of the AIR synthases, selenophosphate synthetase (SelD), and FGAM synthase and is thought to bind ATP [[cite:PUB00013569], [cite:PUB00080732], [cite:PUB00080733], [cite:PUB00013571]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3wjp", "name" "Crystal structure of the HypE CA form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036676", "name" "PurM-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02197" "HypE"}, "panther" {"PTHR30303" "HYDROGENASE ISOENZYMES FORMATION PROTEIN HYPE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005644" "[NiFe]-hydrogenase maturation factor, AIR synthase-related, HypE type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02124" "hydrogenase expression/formation protein HypE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbamoyl dehydratase HypE", "short" "HypE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2916, "taxa" 13973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18327, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14166}, "pathways" 52}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
