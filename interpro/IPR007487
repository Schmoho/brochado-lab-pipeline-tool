{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energize diverse biological systems. ABC transporters are minimally constituted of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These regions can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs.</p>\n\n<p>This family includes the tyrosine-binding protein from Clostridium difficile, which is probably part of an ABC transporter complex involved in tyrosine uptake and it may also import phenylalanine [[cite:PUB00152829]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3lft", "name" "The Crystal Structure of the ABC domain in complex with L-Trp from Streptococcus pneumonia to 1.35A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06325" "type 1 periplasmic ligand-binding domain of uncharacterized ABC-type transport systems predicted to be involved in uptake of amino acids, peptides, or inorganic ions"}, "panther" {"PTHR35271" "ABC TRANSPORTER, SUBSTRATE-BINDING LIPOPROTEIN-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF04392" "ABC transporter substrate binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, tyrosine-binding protein-like", "short" "ABC_transpt-TYRBP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 269, "proteomes" 2805, "taxa" 12588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24312, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24114, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18639}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007487", :literature {"PUB00152829" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Steglich M" "Hofmann JD" "Helmecke J" "Sikorski J" "Sproer C" "Riedel T" "Bunk B" "Overmann J" "Neumann-Schaal M" "Nubel U."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00901", "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "Convergent Loss of ABC Transporter Genes From Clostridioides difficile Genomes Is Associated With Impaired Tyrosine Uptake and p-Cresol Production.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "901", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29867812}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007487", "name" "ABC transporter, tyrosine-binding protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR047776", "name" "Tryptophan ABC transporter substrate-binding TrpX-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 4541}}}
