{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mammalian translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) (or P23) is a protein which has been found to be preferentially synthesised in cells during the early growth phase of some types of tumour [[cite:PUB00000270], [cite:PUB00004349]], but which is also expressed in normal cells. The physiological function of TCTP is still not known. It was first identified as a histamine-releasing factor, acting in IgE +-dependent allergic reactions. In addition, TCTP has been shown to bind to tubulin in the cytoskeleton, has a high affinity for calcium, is the binding target for the antimalarial compound artemisinin, and is induced in vitamin D-dependent apoptosis. TCTP production is thought to be controlled at the translational as well as the transcriptional level [[cite:PUB00007167]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1txj", "name" "Crystal structure of translationally controlled tumour-associated protein (TCTP) from Plasmodium knowlesi"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011323", "name" "Mss4/translationally controlled tumour-associated TCTP", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011057", "name" "Mss4-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00838" "Translationally controlled tumour protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR11991" "TRANSLATIONALLY CONTROLLED TUMOR PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR01653" "TCTPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translationally controlled tumour protein", "short" "Translational_control_tumour_p"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 104, "proteomes" 2551, "taxa" 9120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5886, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5805, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3870}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018105", :literature {"PUB00000270" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Bohm H" "Benndorf R" "Gaestel M" "Gross B" "Nurnberg P" "Kraft R" "Otto A" "Bielka H."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
