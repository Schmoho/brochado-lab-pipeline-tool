A truncated form of the cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to display uridine kinase activity and to readily form a tetramer, the most active form of the wild-type enzyme. Sequence analysis has identified three ATP-binding site consensus motifs. The predicted secondary structure, and sequence comparison with kinases of known structure, is consistent with uridine kinase having the α/β core nucleotide-binding fold common to many kinases [[cite:PUB00000165]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3w34", "name" "Ternary complex of Thermus thermophilus HB8 uridine-cytidine kinase with substrates"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00551" "Uridine kinase [udk]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uridine kinase", "short" "Uridine_kinase_"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1770, "taxa" 8160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7568, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5925}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
