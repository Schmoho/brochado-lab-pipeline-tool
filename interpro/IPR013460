{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this entry form a distinct clade of iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases. The genes encoding these proteins are generally found in apparent operons for the catabolism of rhamnose or fucose. Catabolism of both of these monosaccharides results in the production of lactaldehydes, which are reduced by these enzymes to 1,2 propanediol [[cite:PUB00020757]]. These enzymes are also sometimes called 1,2 propanediol oxidoreductases. They are active under anaerobic conditions in Escherichia coli, while being inactivated by reactive oxygen species under aerobic conditions [[cite:PUB00020754]]. Under aerobic conditions the lactaldehyde product of rhamnose and fucose catabolism is believed to be oxidized to lactate by a separate enzyme, lactaldehyde dehydrogenase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rrm", "name" "Crystal Structure of Lactaldehyde reductase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02638" "lactaldehyde reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lactaldehyde reductase", "short" "Lactal_redase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 520, "taxa" 3027, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3111}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1529", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1529"} {"accession" "GenProp1370", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1370"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
