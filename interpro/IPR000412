ABC transporters are minimally constituted of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These regions can be found on the same protein (mostly in eukaryotes and bacterial exporters) or on two different ones (mostly bacterial importers) [[cite:PUB00014769]]. But in a subgroup of exporters, the transmembrane region is encoded by a separated polypeptide, the ABC-2 type transport system integral membrane protein. The molecular size of this transmembrane protein is around 30kDa. It is thought to contain six transmembrane regions, it either form homooligomeric channels or associate with another type of transmembrane protein to form heteroligomers. The function of the integral inner-membrane protein is to translocate the substrate across the membrane and seems to play an important role in substrate recognition [[cite:PUB00018398]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006648" "ABC-type transport system, permease component, DrrB type"}, "prints" {"PR00164" "ABC2TRNSPORT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC-2 transporter", "short" "ABC_2_transport"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7963, "taxa" 33313, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 155646, "sets" 0, "proteins" 106175, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 81831}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00692", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00692"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000412", :literature {"PUB00018398" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ambudkar SV" "Dey S" "Hrycyna CA" "Ramachandra M" "Pastan I" "Gottesman MM."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
