{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chisel protein plays a role in the regulatory network through which muscle cells coordinate their structural and functional states during growth, adaptation, and repair. The X-linked gene Chisel (Csl/Smpx) was first found expressed selectively in human cardiac and skeletal muscle cells [[cite:PUB00069956]]. It is expressed in embryos in sub-regions of the developing heart corresponding to the future chamber myocardium and in developing skeletal muscles [[cite:PUB00069953]]. It is a potential target of the cardiac homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2-5 [[cite:PUB00069954]]. It localises to the costameric cytoskeleton of muscle cells through its association with focal adhesion proteins, where it may participate in regulating the dynamics of actin through the Rac1/p38 kinase pathway [[cite:PUB00069953]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17416" "SMALL MUSCULAR PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF15355" "Stretch-responsive small skeletal muscle X protein, Chisel"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small muscular protein Chisel", "short" "Chisel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 595, "taxa" 2029, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 766, "sets" 0, "proteins" 766, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 553}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029268", :literature {"PUB00069953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Schindeler A" "Lavulo L" "Harvey RP."], "ISO_journal" "Exp.
