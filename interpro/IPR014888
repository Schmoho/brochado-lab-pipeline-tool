ORF7a/NS7a from betacoronavirus in the subgenera Sarbecovirus (B lineage) are not related to NS7a proteins from other coronavirus lineages. The structure of the structural accessory protein ORF7a, shows similarities to the immunoglobulin-like fold with some features resembling those of the Dl domain of ICAM-1 and suggests a binding activity to integrin I domains [[cite:PUB00035458]]. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, ORF7a is expressed and retained intracellularly within the Golgi network [[cite:PUB00032366]]. ORF7a is thought to play an important role during the SARS-CoV replication cycle [[cite:PUB00094073]]. Expression studies of ORF7a have shown that biological functions include induction of apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway, activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, inhibition of host protein translation, and suppression of cell growth progression. These results collectively suggested that ORF7a protein may be involved in virus-host interactions [[cite:PUB00095949]]. Studies in SARS-CoV-2 revealed that ORF7a plays a role as antagonist of host tetherin (BST2), disrupting its antiviral effect. ORF7a binds to BST2 and sequesters it to the perinuclear region, thereby preventing its antiviral function at cell membrane [[cite:PUB00100395]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1xak", "name" "STRUCTURE OF THE SARS-CORONAVIRUS ORF7A ACCESSORY PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036495", "name" "ORF7a superfamily, coronavirus", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08779" "Betacoronavirus NS7A protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Structural accessory protein ORF7a, SARS-CoV-like", "short" "ORF7a_SARS-CoV-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 134, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 552, "sets" 0, "proteins" 552, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014888", :literature {"PUB00035458" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hanel K" "Stangler T" "Stoldt M" "Willbold D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
