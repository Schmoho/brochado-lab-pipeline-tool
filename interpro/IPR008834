{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Salmonella SpvD (also known as VsdE) plasmid virulence proteins. The structure of the protein from Salmonella typhimurium has been solved and shows a papain-like fold, with a predicted catalytic triad of Cys73, His162 and Asp182. The protein has been shown to have deubiquitinating-like activity, releasing aminoluciferin (AML) from Ub-AML [[cite:PUB00083115]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5lq6", "name" "Salmonella effector SpvD - R161 variant"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05563" "Salmonella plasmid virulence protein SpvD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Salmonella plasmid virulence SpvD", "short" "Sal_SpvD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 80, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 261, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 253}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008834", :literature {"PUB00083115" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Grabe GJ" "Zhang Y" "Przydacz M" "Rolhion N" "Yang Y" "Pruneda JN" "Komander D" "Holden DW" "Hare SA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
