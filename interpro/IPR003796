{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are essential enzymes which catalyse the reduction of ribonucleotides to their respective deoxyribonucleotides, thus providing the precursors necessary for DNA synthesis [[cite:PUB00005164]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this entry are orthologues of the novel transcriptional regulator NrdR ([swissprot:O86848]) from Streptomyces coelicolor. This protein negatively regulates the expression of the RNR genes in this organism [[cite:PUB00020981]]. NrdR, like all proteins in this entry, contains an ATP-cone domain which may regulate DNA-binding activity by sensing deoxyribonucleotides [[cite:PUB00020982]], though since this domain resembles the allosteric effector region of some RNRs it has also been suggested that it may allow NrdR to directly modulate the activity of some reductases, in addition to its function as a transcriptional regulator [[cite:PUB00020981]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NrdR-type proteins have been detected in a large number of bacterial genomes [[cite:PUB00020982]]. They are encoded only once in any particular genome and are usually clustered near RNR genes or genes involved in chromosome replication. Currently, only a single archaeon Natronomonas pharaonis (strain DSM 2160/ATCC 35678) has been shown to encode one of these proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30455" "TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR NRDR"}, "hamap" {"MF_00440" "Transcriptional repressor NrdR [nrdR]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00244" "transcriptional regulator NrdR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonucleotide reductase regulator NrdR-like", "short" "RNR_NrdR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7501, "taxa" 29550, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32801, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32796, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25318}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0287", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0287"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003796", :literature {"PUB00005164" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5115", "authors" ["Reichard P."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/260/5115/1773", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "From RNA to DNA, why so many ribonucleotide reductases?", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "1773-7", "volume" "260", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8511586}, "PUB00020981" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Borovok I" "Gorovitz B" "Yanku M" "Schreiber R" "Gust B" "Chater K" "Aharonowitz Y" "Cohen G."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
