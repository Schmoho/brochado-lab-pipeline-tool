{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The deltex family of proteins is involved in the regulation of Notch signaling, and therefore may play roles in cell-to-cell communications that regulate mechanisms determining cell fate [[cite:PUB00089590]]. They have a central RING-type zinc finger domain and contain a C-terminal domain that is also found in other domain architectures. Deltex-1 (DTX1) contains a RING finger and two WWE domains, indicating that it may be an E3 ubiquitin ligase [[cite:PUB00089591]]. Human deltex 3-like, which contains an additional N-terminal domain (presumably with ubiquitin ligase activity) is also described as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase DTX3L, B-lymphoma- and BAL-associated protein (BBAP), or rhysin-2. DTX3L mediates monoubiquitination of K91 of histone H4 in response to DNA damage [[cite:PUB00063968], [cite:PUB00089592]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8r5n", "name" "DTX1 WWE domain in complex with ATP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR039399", "name" "Deltex, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12622" "DELTEX-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deltex family", "short" "Deltex_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1042, "taxa" 4370, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7828, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7828, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4955}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
