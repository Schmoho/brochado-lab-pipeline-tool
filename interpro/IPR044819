{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes triacylglycerol lipase OBL1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum, which are homologues of the acid lipase from castor bean (RcOBL1). OBL1 is an acid GXSXG-lipase localized to lipid droplets that can hydrolyse a range of triacylglycerols without a clear preference for acyl-chains [[cite:PUB00097154]]. It can also cleave 1,2-diacylglycerol, 1,3-diacylglycerol and 1-monoacylglycerol, but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or sterol esters [[cite:PUB00097154]]. It is required for pollen tube growth. Triacylglycerol hydrolysis by OBL1 may provide acyl groups for the synthesis of membrane lipids in growing pollen tubes [[cite:PUB00097154]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46086" "ALPHA/BETA-HYDROLASES SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Triacylglycerol lipase OBL1-like", "short" "OBL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 361, "taxa" 1469, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2883, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2883, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1750}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
