{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase ([ec:5.1.3.1]) (also known as RPE, pentose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase or PPE) is the enzyme that converts D-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) into D-xylulose 5-phosphate in Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle. In Ralstonia eutropha (Alcaligenes eutrophus) two copies of the gene coding for PPE are known [[cite:PUB00002204]], one is chromosomally encoded [swissprot:P40117], the other one is on a plasmid [swissprot:Q04539]. PPE has been found in a wide range of bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi and plants. All the proteins have from 209 to 241 amino acid residues. The enzyme has a TIM barrel structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tqj", "name" "Crystal structure of D-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase from Synechocystis to 1.6 angstrom resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02227" "Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase [rpe]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001461" "Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01163" "ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase", "short" "Ribul_P_3_epim"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11315, "taxa" 42276, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45421, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45398, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34422}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
