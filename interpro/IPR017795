{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are mostly fungal enzymes involved in secondary metabolite production. Characterised or partially characterised members include several examples of dimethylallyltryptophan synthase, LtxC from lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis, and a probable dimethylallyl tyrosine synthase  [[cite:PUB00042956], [cite:PUB00042997]]. Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase ([ec:2.5.1.34]) catalyses the first step of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis. Ergot alkaloids, which are produced by endophyte fungi, can enhance plant host fitness, but also cause livestock toxicosis to host plants.  O-glucose prenyltransferase PaPT is required for the biosynthesis of fusicoccins, potent activators of plasma membrane H+-ATPases in plants causing constriction canker [[cite:PUB00090975]].  O-dimethylallyltransferase cpaD is required for the biosynthesis of the fungal neurotoxin cyclopiazonic acid, a nanomolar inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase [[cite:PUB00089907]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes some proteins from bacteria, such as TleC, which has being identified as a prenyltransferase involved in the synthesis of teleocidin B in Streptomyces [[cite:PUB00080707]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5kd6", "name" "Crystal structure of the aromatic prenyltransferase AtaPT from Aspergillus terreus A8-4 in complex with dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate and (-)-butyrolactone II"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13929" "aromatic prenyltransferases (PTases) of the DMATS/CymD familiy"}, "panther" {"PTHR40627" "INDOLE PRENYLTRANSFERASE TDIB-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF11991" "Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03429" "DMATS family aromatic prenyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aromatic prenyltransferase, DMATS-type", "short" "Aro_prenylTrfase_DMATS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 48, "proteomes" 720, "taxa" 2166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3384, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3343, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2161}, "pathways" 47}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
