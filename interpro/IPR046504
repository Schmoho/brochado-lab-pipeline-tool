{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Podophage GP4 portal-tail complex adaptor protein gp81 and related phage and prophage proteins. Bacteriophage tail fibres play a critical role in the early stage of infection by binding to the bacterial surface. There are two structurally homologous adaptors (I and II) in the GP4 tail. Adaptor I consists of 12 copies of proteins gp81. This protein can be divided into helix bundle domain, Î²-dock domain, and C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00155639]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20387" "Family of unknown function (DUF6682)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Podophage GP4 portal-tail complex adaptor protein gp81-like", "short" "Gp81-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 137, "taxa" 1143, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 707, "sets" 0, "proteins" 707, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 409}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046504", :literature {"PUB00155639" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Zheng J" "Chen W" "Xiao H" "Yang F" "Song J" "Cheng L" "Liu H."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2023.168258", "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Asymmetric Structure of Podophage GP4 Reveals a Novel Architecture of Three Types of Tail Fibers.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "168258", "volume" "435", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37660940}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046504", "name" "Podophage GP4 portal-tail complex adaptor protein gp81-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 25, "alignment:full" 150}}}
