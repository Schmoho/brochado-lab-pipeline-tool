{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the late protein H2 found in Vaccinia and other poxviruses. This protein is a highly conserved viral membrane protein found in all sequenced poxviruses, containing an N-terminal transmembrane domain and four conserved cysteines thought to be involved in the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds [[cite:PUB00034708]]. H2 has been shown to be necessary for entry into the host cell and virus-induced cell-cell fusion, but is not required for virus morphogenesis or the attachment of virus particles to cells. It is part of an entry-fusion complex composed of eight viral membrane proteins [[cite:PUB00034709]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8ini", "name" "vaccinia H2 protein without the transmembrane region"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03356" "Viral late protein H2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral late protein H2", "short" "Pox_LP_H2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 41, "taxa" 173, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 223, "sets" 0, "proteins" 223, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005023", :literature {"PUB00034708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Senkevich TG" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
