{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Grainyhead/CP2 are highly conserved transcription factors in metazoa that function as key regulators of epithelial differentiation and organ development. The family comprises two distinct groups, CP2 (CCAAT box-binding protein 2) and Grh (grainyhead). All family members share a common domain architecture  [[cite:PUB00090639], [cite:PUB00090637]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grainyhead/Elf1 was first identified in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00090642]]. Three grainyhead-like (Grhl) homologues constitute the Grh subfamily in mammals [[cite:PUB00090638]]. Grhl proteins are predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and are essential regulators of epithelial development and extracellular barrier repair after tissue damage [[cite:PUB00090638], [cite:PUB00090640], [cite:PUB00090641]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TFCP2 (LSF, CP2 transcription factor) is a critical regulator of erythroid gene expression [[cite:PUB00087355], [cite:PUB00087356]]. It also regulates the expressison of the male-dominant sex-determining gene SRY [[cite:PUB00087357]]. TFCP2 can interact with NF-E4 proteins forming heteromeric stage selector protein complex (SSP); this complex is able to bind stage selector element (SSE) and regulate embryonic globin expression in fetal-erythroid cells [[cite:PUB00087358]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11037" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR CP2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor CP2-like", "short" "TF_CP2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1804, "taxa" 6014, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11687, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11687, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7400}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040167", :literature {"PUB00090637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ming Q" "Roske Y" "Schuetz A" "Walentin K" "Ibraimi I" "Schmidt-Ott KM" "Heinemann U."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1299", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Structural basis of gene regulation by the Grainyhead/CP2 transcription factor family.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "2082-2095", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29309642}, "PUB00087358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Jane SM" "Nienhuis AW" "Cunningham JM."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Hemoglobin switching in man and chicken is mediated by a heteromeric complex between the ubiquitous transcription factor CP2 and a developmentally specific protein.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "97-105", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7828600}, "PUB00090642" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Bray SJ" "Burke B" "Brown NH" "Hirsh J."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.3.8.1130", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Embryonic expression pattern of a family of Drosophila proteins that interact with a central nervous system regulatory element.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "1130-45", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2792757}, "PUB00090641" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Mlacki M" "Kikulska A" "Krzywinska E" "Pawlak M" "Wilanowski T."], "ISO_journal" "Exp.
