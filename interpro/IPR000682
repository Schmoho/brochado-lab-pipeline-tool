{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.77]) (PCMT) [[cite:PUB00000999]] (which is also known as L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase) is an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the free carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl residues in a variety of peptides and proteins. The enzyme does not act on normal L-aspartyl residues L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl are the products of the spontaneous deamidation and/or isomerisation of normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues in proteins. PCMT plays a role in the repair and/or degradation of these damaged proteins; the enzymatic methyl esterification of the abnormal residues can lead to their conversion to normal L-aspartyl residues. The SAM domain is present in most of these proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2yxe", "name" "Crystal structure of L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltranferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS01279" "Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase signature"}, "hamap" {"MF_00090" "Protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase [pcm]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00080" "protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11579" "PROTEIN-L-ISOASPARTATE O-METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase", "short" "PCMT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8139, "taxa" 31985, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 54057, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53921, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 40566}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00985", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00985"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
