The sorting signal is typically VPEP-CTERM, but variant forms of the motif, such as VSEP or VPLPA, do occur in the family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041927" "exosortase-dependent surface protein XDP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosortase-dependent surface protein XDP1", "short" "Xrt_dep_XDP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 92, "taxa" 431, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 339, "sets" 0, "proteins" 339, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 258}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049672", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049672", "name" "Exosortase-dependent surface protein XDP1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
