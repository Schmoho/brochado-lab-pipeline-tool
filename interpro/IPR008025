{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Contractility of vascular smooth muscle depends on phosphorylation of myosin light chains, and is modulated by hormonal control of myosin phosphatase activity. Signaling pathways activate kinases such as PKC or Rho-dependent kinases that phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase inhibitor protein called CPI-17 (also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14). Phosphorylation of CPI-17 at Thr-38 enhances its inhibitory potency 1000-fold, creating a molecular switch for regulating contraction [[cite:PUB00010502]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036658", "name" "CPI-17 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16188" "PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1 INHIBITOR POTENTIATED BY PROTEIN KINASE C"}, "pfam" {"PF05361" "PKC-activated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CPI-17", "short" "CPI-17"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 879, "taxa" 3556, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3451, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2172}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008025", :literature {"PUB00010502" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ohki S" "Eto M" "Kariya E" "Hayano T" "Hayashi Y" "Yazawa M" "Brautigan D" "Kainosho M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
