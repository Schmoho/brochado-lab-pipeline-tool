The member from Escherichia coli was shown to bind selenium in the absence of a working SelD-dependent selenium incorporation system [[cite:PUB00057301]]. Note that while the E. coli member contains a single Cys residue, a likely selenium binding site, some other members of this protein family contain two Cys residues or none.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14001" "YdfZ protein"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03318" "putative selenium delivery protein YdfZ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative selenium-binding protein YdfZ", "short" "Se-bd_putative_YdfZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 59, "taxa" 851, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 834, "sets" 0, "proteins" 834, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 641}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017704", :literature {"PUB00057301" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Lacourciere GM" "Levine RL" "Stadtman TC."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
