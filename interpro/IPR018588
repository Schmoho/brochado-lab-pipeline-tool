{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihaem cytochrome c (DHC) is a soluble c-type cytochrome that folds into two distinct domains, each binding a single haem group and connected by a small linker region. Despite little sequence similarity, the N-terminal domain (residues 12-75) is a class I type cytochrome c, that binds one of the haems, but the domain surrounding the other haem is structurally unique. DHC binds electrostatically to an oxygen-binding protein, sphaeroides haem protein (SHP), as a component of a conserved electron transfer pathway. DHC acts as the physiological electron donor for SHP during phototrophic growth [[cite:PUB00040838]]. In certain species DHC is found upstream of [interpro:IPR011577].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2fwt", "name" "Crystal structure of DHC purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09626" "Dihaem cytochrome c"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihaem cytochrome c", "short" "Dihaem_cytochrome-c"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 490, "taxa" 2823, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2635, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1869}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018588", :literature {"PUB00040838" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Gibson HR" "Mowat CG" "Miles CS" "Li BR" "Leys D" "Reid GA" "Chapman SK."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi060288q", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Structural and functional studies on DHC, the diheme cytochrome c from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and its interaction with SHP, the sphaeroides heme protein.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "6363-71", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16700547}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018588", "name" "Dihaem cytochrome c", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 17, "alignment:full" 588}}}
