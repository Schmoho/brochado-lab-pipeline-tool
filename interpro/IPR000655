{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacteriophage lambda encodes two repressors: the Cro repressor that acts to turn off early gene transcription during the lytic cycle, and the lambda or cI repressor that is required to maintain lysogenic growth. Together the Cro and cI repressors form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) superfamily. The lambda Cro repressor binds to DNA as a highly flexible dimer. The crystal structure of the lambda Cro repressor [[cite:PUB00016684]] reveals a HTH DNA-binding protein with an α/β fold that differs from other Cro family members, possibly by an evolutionary fold change [[cite:PUB00016685]]. Most Cro proteins, such as Enterobacteria phage P22 Cro and Bacteriophage 434 Cro, have an all-α structure that is thought to be ancestral to lambda Cro, where the fourth and fifth helices are replaced by a β-sheet, possibly as a result of secondary structure switching rather than by nonhomologous replacement [[cite:PUB00016686]]. This entry represents the lambda-type Cro repressor with an α/β topology found in tailed bacteriophages and prophages mainly from proteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ovg", "name" "Lambda Cro Q27P/A29S/K32Q triple mutant at 1.35 A in space group P3221"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010982", "name" "Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038202", "name" "Regulatory protein cro superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09048" "Cro"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003217" "Phage lambda regulatory protein cro"}, "prints" {"PR00030" "HTHCRO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Regulatory protein cro-like", "short" "Cro-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 85, "taxa" 761, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 656, "sets" 0, "proteins" 656, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 409}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000655", :literature {"PUB00016684" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ohlendorf DH" "Tronrud DE" "Matthews BW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
