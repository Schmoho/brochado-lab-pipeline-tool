Xyloglucan is a soluble hemicellulose with a backbone of beta-1,4-linked glucose units, partially substituted with alpha-1,6-linked xylopyranose branches. It binds noncovalently to cellulose, cross-linking the adjacent cellulose microfibrils, giving it a key structural role as a matrix polymer. XTHs catalyses xyloglucan endohydrolysis (XEH) and/or endotransglycosylation (XET) and are involved in the modification of cell wall structure by cleaving and, often, also re-joining xyloglucan molecules in primary plant cell walls [[cite:PUB00074924]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Glycoside hydrolase family 16 [cazy:GH16] comprises enzymes with a number of known activities; lichenase ([ec:3.2.1.73]); xyloglucan xyloglucosyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1.207]); agarase ([ec:3.2.1.81]); kappa-carrageenase ([ec:3.2.1.83]); endo-beta-1,3-glucanase ([ec:3.2.1.39]); endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase ([ec:3.2.1.6]); endo-beta-galactosidase ([ec:3.2.1.103]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2uwb", "name" "Crystal structure of the Nasturtium seedling mutant xyloglucanase isoform NXG1-delta-YNIIG"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31062" "XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE PROTEIN 8-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-glucanase/XTH", "short" "Beta-glucanase/XTH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 652, "taxa" 3389, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17332, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17332, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10546}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
