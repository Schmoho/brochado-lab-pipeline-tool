{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycerol enters bacterial cells via facilitated diffusion, an energy-independent transport process catalysed by the glycerol transport facilitator GlpF, an integral membrane protein of the aquaporin family. Intracellular glycerol is usually converted to glycerol-3-P in an ATP-requiring phosphorylation reaction catalysed by glycerol kinase (GlpK). Glycerol-3-P, the inducer of the glpFK operon, is not a substrate for GlpF and hence remains entrapped in the cell where it is metabolized further. In some bacterial species, for example Bacillus firmus, glycerol-3-P activates the antiterminator GlpP [[cite:PUB00008492]]. In B. subtilis, glpF and glpK are organised in an operon followed by the glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase-encoding glpD gene and preceded by glpP coding for an antiterminator regulating the expression of glpFK, glpD and glpTQ. Their induction requires the inducer glycerol-3-P, which activates the antiterminator GlpP by allowing it to bind to the leader region of glpD and presumably also of glpFK and glpTQ mRNAs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1vkf", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF A GLYCEROL UPTAKE OPERON ANTITERMINATOR-RELATED PROTEIN (TM1436) FROM THERMOTOGA MARITIMA MSB8 AT 1.65 A RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35787" "GLYCEROL UPTAKE OPERON ANTITERMINATOR REGULATORY PROTEIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016897" "Glycerol uptake regulatory protein"}, "pfam" {"PF04309" "Glycerol-3-phosphate responsive antiterminator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol uptake operon antiterminator", "short" "GlpP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 1077, "taxa" 4273, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4671, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4670, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3616}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006699", :literature {"PUB00008492" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Holmberg C" "Rutberg B."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
