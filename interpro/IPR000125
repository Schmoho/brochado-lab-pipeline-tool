{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glycoside hydrolase family 14 ([ec:3.2.1.2], [cazy:GH14]) which encompasses the beta-amylases. Beta-amylases, which are found in plants and bacteria, hydrolyse 1,4-alpha-glycosidic linkages in starch-type polysaccharide substrates, removing successive maltose units from the non-reducing ends of the chains. In potato plants, the enzyme has been found to work optimally at 40 degrees C, becoming unstable above this temperature. On the basis of sequence comparisons, plant and bacterial beta-amylases can be readily distinguished from each other.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structure of a complex of soybean beta-amylase with an inhibitor (alpha-cyclodextrin) has been determined to 3.0A resolution by X-ray diffraction [[cite:PUB00002354]]. The enzyme folds into large and small domains: the large domain has a (β α)8 super-secondary structural core, while the smaller is formed from two long loops extending from the β3 and β4 strands of the (β α)8 fold [[cite:PUB00002354]]. The interface of the two domains, together with shorter loops from the (β α)8 core, form a deep cleft, in which the inhibitor binds [[cite:PUB00002354]]. Two maltose molecules also bind in the cleft, one sharing a binding site with alpha-cyclodextrin, and the other sitting more deeply in the cleft [[cite:PUB00002354]]. Sequence alignments allow us to relate features of the bacterial beta-amylases to the soybean structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>O-Glycosyl hydrolases ([ec:3.2.1.]) are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety.
