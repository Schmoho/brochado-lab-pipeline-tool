{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoserine phosphatase ([ec:3.1.3.3]), also known as O-phosphoserine phosphohydrolase, is involved in both serine and glycine biosynthesis. It catalyzes the reaction 3-phospho-serine + H2O = L-serine + phosphate, which is the last step in the biosynthesis of serine from carbohydrates. The reaction proceeds via the formation of a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate. It acts as a homodimer, and requires magnesium as a cofactor [[cite:PUB00029151]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1l7m", "name" "HIGH RESOLUTION LIGANDED STRUCTURE OF PHOSPHOSERINE PHOSPHATASE (PI COMPLEX)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00029" "phosphoserine phosphatase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00338" "phosphoserine phosphatase SerB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoserine phosphatase", "short" "PSP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7192, "taxa" 26396, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24462, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24462, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18944}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
