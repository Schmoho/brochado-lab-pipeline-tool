{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins contains an AMP-binding domain associated with acyl CoA-ligases. These proteins are generally found in genomes containing the exosortase/PEP-CTERM protein export system [[cite:PUB00034422]], specifically the type 1 variant of this system described by [genprop:GenProp0652]. When found in this context they are invariably present next to a decarboxylase enzyme. A number of sequences from Burkholderia species are also present in this entry, but the genomic context is obviously different. The hypothesis of a constant substrate for this family is only strong where the exosortase context is present.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03098" "acyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming), exosortase A system-associated"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming), exosortase system type 1 associated", "short" "AcylCoA_ligase_PEP_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 585, "taxa" 1958, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1675, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1675, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1320}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0652", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0652"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017529", :literature {"PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
