{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial proteins of around 180 residues in length that appear to be multi-pass membrane proteins. Many family members are functionally uncharacterised. Others appear to be substrate specific components of an energy-coupling factor (ECF) type transport system, such as Thiamine precursor transporter HmpT, which is likely a thiamine precursor-binding protein that interacts with the ECF ABC-transporter complex. Unlike classic ABC transporters, this ECF transporter provides the energy necessary to transport a number of different substrates. The substrates themselves are bound by transmembrane, not extracytoplasmic soluble proteins.
