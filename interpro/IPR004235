{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Scytalone dehydratase (SDH) and similar proteins mainly found in the fungi Accomycota. SDH is a member of the group of enzymes involved in fungal melanin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00099645], [cite:PUB00099644]]. It was first identified in a phytopathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe grisea (Rice blast fungus), which causes rice blast disease [[cite:PUB00022713], [cite:PUB00020316]]. Scytalone dehydratase is a molecular target of inhibitor design efforts aimed at protecting rice plants from fungal disease [[cite:PUB00007439], [cite:PUB00016790]].
