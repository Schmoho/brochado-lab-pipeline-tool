{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>WDR41 is the non-catalytic component of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, a complex that has guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and regulates autophagy [[cite:PUB00085173], [cite:PUB00085174], [cite:PUB00090522], [cite:PUB00085172]]. This complex also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex and inhibiting its protein kinase activity [[cite:PUB00085174], [cite:PUB00090522]]. WDR41 plays an essential role in C9orf72 lysosome recruitment, which is important for lysosomal responses to changes in acid availability [[cite:PUB00156069]]. WDR41 also interacts with PQLC2, a lysosomal cationic amino acid transporter that serves as a sensor that responds to scarcity of its substrates by recruiting C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex to the surface of lysosomes [[cite:PUB00156070]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22805" "WDR41-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein 41", "short" "WDR41"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 654, "taxa" 2391, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 869}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040102", :literature {"PUB00085173" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sullivan PM" "Zhou X" "Robins AM" "Paushter DH" "Kim D" "Smolka MB" "Hu F."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Neuropathol Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-016-0324-5", "medline_journal" "Acta Neuropathol Commun", "title" "The ALS/FTLD associated protein C9orf72 associates with SMCR8 and WDR41 to regulate the autophagy-lysosome pathway.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "51", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27193190}, "PUB00085174" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Sellier C" "Campanari ML" "Julie Corbier C" "Gaucherot A" "Kolb-Cheynel I" "Oulad-Abdelghani M" "Ruffenach F" "Page A" "Ciura S" "Kabashi E" "Charlet-Berguerand N."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201593350", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Loss of C9ORF72 impairs autophagy and synergizes with polyQ Ataxin-2 to induce motor neuron dysfunction and cell death.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1276-97", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27103069}, "PUB00090522" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Yang M" "Liang C" "Swaminathan K" "Herrlinger S" "Lai F" "Shiekhattar R" "Chen JF."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1601167", "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "A C9ORF72/SMCR8-containing complex regulates ULK1 and plays a dual role in autophagy.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1601167", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27617292}, "PUB00085172" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Jung J" "Nayak A" "Schaeffer V" "Starzetz T" "Kirsch AK" "Muller S" "Dikic I" "Mittelbronn M" "Behrends C."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23063", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Multiplex image-based autophagy RNAi screening identifies SMCR8 as ULK1 kinase activity and gene expression regulator.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28195531}, "PUB00156070" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Talaia G" "Amick J" "Ferguson SM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2014941118", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Receptor-like role for PQLC2 amino acid transporter in the lysosomal sensing of cationic amino acids.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e2014941118", "volume" "118", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33597295}, "PUB00156069" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Amick J" "Tharkeshwar AK" "Amaya C" "Ferguson SM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E17-12-0703", "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "WDR41 supports lysosomal response to changes in amino acid availability.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "2213-2227", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29995611}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010506", "name" "regulation of autophagy", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040102", "name" "WD repeat-containing protein 41", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
