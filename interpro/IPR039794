It is a heterodimer whose alpha subunit bears the glycosyl hydrolase active site, while its beta subunit role is controversial. The beta subunit has been reported to be involved in the solubility and stability of the heterodimeric enzyme, and in retaining the enzyme within the endoplasmic reticulum [[cite:PUB00016600]]. Other studies suggest that the beta subunit modulates N-Glycan trimming in both fission yeast and mammals [[cite:PUB00061967], [cite:PUB00061969], [cite:PUB00061968]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunit gamma (GNPTG) is a non-catalytic component of the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase complex.
