{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The P protein, also known as Glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), is part of the glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex (GDC), also annotated as glycine cleavage system or glycine synthase. GDC consists of four proteins P, H, L and T [[cite:PUB00009491]]. The P protein ([ec:1.4.4.2]) binds the alpha-amino group of glycine through its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, carbon dioxide is released and the remaining methylamin moiety is then transferred to the lipoamide cofactor of the H protein. The reaction catalysed by this protein is:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>Glycine + lipoylprotein = S-aminomethyldihydrolipoylprotein + CO2</reaction></p>\n\n<p>The subunit composition of glycine cleavage system P proteins have been classified into two types. Those from eukaryotes and some of the P proteins from prokaryotes (e.g. Escherichia coli) are in the homodimeric form. The rest of those from prokaryotes are heterotetrameric, with two different subunits which, based on sequence similarities, correspond respectively to the N and C-terminal halves of the eukaryotic subunit [[cite:PUB00038183]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the probable glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) subunit 2 from prokaryotes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00713" "Probable glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) subunit 2 [gcvPB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) subunit 2", "short" "GcvPB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1318, "taxa" 6139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6590, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6590, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5018}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
