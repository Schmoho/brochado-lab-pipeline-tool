{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant synaptotagmins and related proteins. In Arabodopsis, there are five members, SYT1-5. Structurally, they have a short uncleaved N-terminal signal peptide that overlaps a transmembrane (TM) domain, followed by a cytosolic variable region and two C-terminal C2 domains, C2A and C2B. Whereas C2A and C2B each bind phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner, fold independently and act synergistically, C2B is essential for activity [[cite:PUB00097811]]. Arabidopsis SYT1, also known as SYTA, plays an important role in maintaining plasma membrane integrity during freezing and osmotic stresses [[cite:PUB00097812], [cite:PUB00097813]]. It also serves as a virus movement protein that transports its cargos to plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell spread via an endocytic recycling pathway [[cite:PUB00097807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7as6", "name" "2.0 angstrom structure of plant Extended Synaptotagmin 1, C2A domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10774" "EXTENDED SYNAPTOTAGMIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Synaptotagmin, plant", "short" "Synaptotagmin_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 442, "taxa" 2100, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5452, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3217}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045050", :literature {"PUB00097812" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Eckardt NA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis synaptotagmin1 maintains plasma membrane integrity.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "3182", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19088328}, "PUB00097813" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Yamazaki T" "Kawamura Y" "Minami A" "Uemura M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Calcium-dependent freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis involves membrane resealing via synaptotagmin SYT1.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "3389-404", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19088330}, "PUB00097807" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lewis JD" "Lazarowitz SG."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Arabidopsis synaptotagmin SYTA regulates endocytosis and virus movement protein cell-to-cell transport.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "2491-6", "volume" "107", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20133785}, "PUB00097811" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Chapman ER."], "ISO_journal" "Annu Rev Biochem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Annu Rev Biochem", "title" "How does synaptotagmin trigger neurotransmitter release?", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "615-41", "volume" "77", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18275379}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008289", "name" "lipid binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045050", "name" "Synaptotagmin, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
