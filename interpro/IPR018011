{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of a number of carbohydrate sulphotransferases that transfer sulphate to carbohydrate groups in glycoproteins and glycolipids. These include:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferases 8 and 9, which transfer sulphate to position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans [[cite:PUB00033954]]. They function in the biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, by mediating sulphation of their carbohydrate structures.</li>\r\n<li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferase 10, which transfers sulphate to position 3 of the terminal glucuronic acid in both protein- and lipid-linked oligosaccharides [[cite:PUB00033955]]. It directs the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate structure, a sulphated glucuronyl-lactosaminyl residue carried by many neural recognition molecules, which is involved in cell interactions during ontogenetic development and in synaptic plasticity in the adult.</li>\r\n<li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferases 11 - 13, which catalyze the transfer of sulphate to position 4 of the GalNAc residue of chondroitin [[cite:PUB00033956]]. Chondroitin sulphate constitutes the predominant proteoglycan present in cartilage and is distributed on the surfaces of many cells and extracellular matrices. Some, thought not all, of these enzymes also transfer sulphate to dermatan.</li>\r\n<li>Carbohydrate sulphotransferase 14 (D4ST1), which transfers sulphate to position 4 of the GalNAc residue of dermatan sulphate [[cite:PUB00033957]].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12137" "CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 8-10", "short" "Carb_sulfotrans_8-10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1683, "taxa" 7177, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14087, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14087, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9681}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
