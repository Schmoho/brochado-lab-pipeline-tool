{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Egg-lysin from Haliotis rufescens and similar proteins from molluscs. This protein, also known as Sperm-lysin, binds to the egg vitelline envelope (VE) via the VE receptor for lysin (VERL) following its release from sperm. It then dissolves the VE non-enzymatically to create a hole, thereby allowing the sperm to pass through the envelope and fuse with the egg [[cite:PUB00011856]]. Structurally, this protein consists of a bundle of helices and show species-specific binding to their egg receptor, possibly through differences in charged surface residues [[cite:PUB00011857], [cite:PUB00005176]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gak", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF GREEN ABALONE SP18"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035916", "name" "Egg-lysin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00243" "Lysin-Sp18"}, "pfam" {"PF01303" "Egg lysin (Sperm-lysin)"}, "prints" {"PR01882" "Lysin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Egg lysin (Sperm-lysin)", "short" "Egg_lysin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 67, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 89, "sets" 0, "proteins" 89, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 88}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001379", :literature {"PUB00011856" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["Kresge N" "Vacquier VD" "Stout CD."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
