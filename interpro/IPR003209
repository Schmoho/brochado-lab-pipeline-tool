{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase ([ec:3.5.4.27]) catalyses the interconversion of methenyltetrahydromethanopterin and N(5)formyltetrahydromethanopterin, and is found in both archaea and bacteria. In methanogenic archaea, such as Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (strain Marburg / DSM 2133), this enzyme is involved in the production of methane from carbon dioxide [[cite:PUB00016914]]. In the sulphate-reducer Archaeoglobus fulgidus, this enzyme is involved in the tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent oxidation of lactate [[cite:PUB00016915]]. In Gram-negative methylotrophic bacteria this enzyme is involved in the tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent oxidation of formaldehyde to formate [[cite:PUB00016916]].  The protein functions as a homodimer or homotrimer, depending on the organism.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qlm", "name" "The crystal structure of methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00545" "MCH"}, "hamap" {"MF_00486" "Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase [mch]"}, "pfam" {"PF02289" "Cyclohydrolase (MCH)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03120" "methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase", "short" "METHMP_CycHdrlase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 558, "taxa" 2805, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3206, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3205, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2610}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0671", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0671"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
