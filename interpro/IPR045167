{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Hobbit protein from Drosophila melanogaster and its homologues such as Bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 2 from human (BLTP2/KIAA0100) and FMP27 from yeast, referred to the Hob proteins [[cite:PUB00101860], [cite:PUB00101861]]. These proteins are localised to endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites described as conserved lipid-binding proteins. They are tube-forming transport proteins which bind to phosphatidylinositols and affect phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) distribution [[cite:PUB00101862], [cite:PUB00101860], [cite:PUB00101861]], that have a long hydrophobic groove and can mediate bulk transport of lipids between organelles. This entry also includes maize protein APT1 and Arabidopsis homologues SABRE and KIP [[cite:PUB00101861]]. The Hob family belongs to the repeating β-groove (RBG) superfamily together with VPS13, ATG2, SHIP164, Csf1/BLTP1, which are all conserved lipid transfer proteins containing long hydrophobic grooves [[cite:PUB00101861]]. They all share the same structure consisting of multiple repeating modules consisting of five β-sheets followed by a loop.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10344" "Hobbit/FMP27/BTLP2 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR15678" "ANTIGEN MLAA-22-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hobbit", "short" "Hobbit"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 109, "proteomes" 2265, "taxa" 7751, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6756, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5615, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 896}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045167", :literature {"PUB00044152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Xu Z" "Dooner HK."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.105.050237", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The maize aberrant pollen transmission 1 gene is a SABRE/KIP homolog required for pollen tube growth.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1251-61", "volume" "172", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16299389}, "PUB00044434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Reinders J" "Zahedi RP" "Pfanner N" "Meisinger C" "Sickmann A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
