{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5A/B/C/D (TENT5A/B/C/D). In general, they contain a NTase (nucleotidyltransferase) domain, some members possess additional C-terminal PAP/OAS1 substrate binding domain [[cite:PUB00066751]]. They are active non-canonical poly(A) polymerases, which modify cytosolic and/or nuclear RNA 3' ends [[cite:PUB00090039]]. They have different functions in many tissues at various stages of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human TENT5A is a SMAD signalling pathway related protein, where SMADs are intercellular effectors of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [[cite:PUB00066751]]. The TENT5C gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in multiple myeloma. TENT5C acts as an onco-suppressor in multiple myeloma [[cite:PUB00090040]]. TENT5C also seems to enhance replication of some viruses, including yellow fever virus, in response to type I interferon [[cite:PUB00075453]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01153" "Domain of unknown function (DUF1693)"}, "pfam" {"PF07984" "Nucleotidyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR12974" "PRION-LIKE- Q/N-RICH -DOMAIN-BEARING PROTEIN PROTEIN 44"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Terminal nucleotidyltransferase", "short" "TET5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 1014, "taxa" 4048, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4767, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4755, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3341}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
