{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR2.  The Ragulator complex consists of LAMTOR1, LAMTOR2, LAMTOR3, LAMTOR4 and LAMTOR5 [[cite:PUB00060388]].  The Ragulator complex is involved in amino acid sensing and activation of the mTORC1 signalling pathway.  The complex is activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activating the small GTPases Rag [[cite:PUB00060388]], [[cite:PUB00068038]].
