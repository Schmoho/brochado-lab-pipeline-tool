{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The sulfakinin (SK) family of neuropeptides have only been identified in crustaceans and insects. For most species there is the potential for producing two sulfakinin peptides, one has a short sulfakinin sequence. The function of the sulfakinins is difficult to assess. For the Periplaneta americana (American cockroach), various forms of the endogenous sulfakinins have been shown to be active on the hindgut, and also on the heart. In Calliphora vomitoria (Blue blowfly) the peptides act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators, linking the brain with all thoracic and abdominal ganglia. In adults of Penaeus monodon (Penoeid shrimp) they appear to be restricted to a few neurones in the brain with a neural pathway extending along to the ventral thoracic and abdominal ganglia [[cite:PUB00020387]]. Drosulfakinins (sulfakinins expressed in drosopholis) have been shown to regulate gut muscle contraction in adults but not in larvae [[cite:PUB00094352]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08257" "Sulfakinin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfakinin", "short" "Sulfakinin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 100, "taxa" 846, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 421, "sets" 0, "proteins" 259, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 144}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013259", :literature {"PUB00020387" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Johnsen AH" "Duve H" "Davey M" "Hall M" "Thorpe A."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
