{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MsrPQ is an enzymatic system that repairs proteins containing methionine sulfoxide in the bacterial cell envelope. MsrP, a molybdo-enzyme, and MsrQ, a haem-binding membrane protein, are widely conserved throughout Gram-negative bacteria. MsrPQ uses electrons from the respiratory chain, which represents a novel mechanism to import reducing equivalents into the bacterial cell envelope. MsrPQ is essential for the maintenance of envelope integrity under bleach stress, rescuing periplasmic proteins from methionine oxidation, including the primary periplasmic chaperone SurA [[cite:PUB00078613]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family represents MsrQ.</p>\n<p>This family also includes magnetosome protein MamZ, which despite its similarity of sequence to MsrQ, has been shown not to genetically interact with MsrP.
