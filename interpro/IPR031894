{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RexA is a family of bacterial anti-phage proteins. It forms one partner in the two-component abortive infection system, Abi, of E. coli in partnership with RexB, a membrane-anchored ion- channel [[cite:PUB00056243]]. Two RexA are needed to activate one RexB, and activation causes opening of the channel, the efflux of cations, a drop in cellular levels of ATP and subsequent death of the host cell and abortion of the phage infecting process which requires ATP.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15969" "Intracellular sensor of Lambda phage, Abi component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Abi component, intracellular sensor of Lambda phage RexA", "short" "RexA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 317, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 146, "sets" 0, "proteins" 146, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 115}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031894", :literature {"PUB00056243" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Labrie SJ" "Samson JE" "Moineau S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
