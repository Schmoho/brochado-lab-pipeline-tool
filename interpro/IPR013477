{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Homocitrate synthase NifV catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A and 2-oxoglutarate to form homocitrate and CoA. Homocitrate is a component of the FeMo-cofactor present in the catalytic centre of dinitrogenase [[cite:PUB00088726]]. This family includes the NifV proteins of Heliobacterium chlorum [[cite:PUB00081201]] and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. Most NifV-type homocitrate synthases are encoded within operons for nitrogen fixation [[cite:PUB00081202]].</p>\n\n<p>FrbC (NifV) of Streptomyces rubellomurinus catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and 2-oxoglutarate, a reaction similar to one catalyzed by homocitrate synthase. FrbC is also the 2-phosphonomethylmalate synthase ([ec:2.3.3.19]) that catalyses the condensation of acetyl-CoA and 3-phosphonopyruvate, one of the steps required in the biosynthesis of FR900098, a potent antimalarial antibiotic [[cite:PUB00081199]]. This protein is also required for assembly of the nitrogenase MoFe complex, but its exact role is unknown [[cite:PUB00081200]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07939" "Streptomyces rubellomurinus FrbC and related proteins, catalytic TIM barrel domain"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02660" "homocitrate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homocitrate synthase NifV-like", "short" "NifV/FrbC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 707, "taxa" 3352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2459, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2459, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1975}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
