{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this largely uncharacterised family share a motif approximating DXH(X25)GDXXD(X25)GNHD as found in several phosphoesterases, including the nucleases SbcD and Mre11, and a family of uncharacterised archaeal putative phosphoesterases. In this family, the His residue in GNHD portion of the motif is not conserved. The member MJ0936, one of two from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii), was shown [[cite:PUB00015606]] to act on model phosphodiesterase substrates; a divalent cation was required.
