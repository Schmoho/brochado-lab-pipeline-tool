{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of trypanosomal proteins resemble vertebrate mucins. The protein consists of three regions. The N and C terminii are conserved between all members of the family, whereas the central region is not well conserved and contains a large number of threonine residues which can be glycosylated [[cite:PUB00002922]]. Indirect evidence suggested that these genes might encode the core protein of parasite mucins, glycoproteins that were proposed to be involved in the interaction with, and invasion of, mammalian host cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01456" "Mucin-like glycoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mucin-like glycoprotein", "short" "Tryp_mucin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 93, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2689, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2350, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2329}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000458", :literature {"PUB00002922" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Di Noia JM" "Sanchez DO" "Frasch AC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
