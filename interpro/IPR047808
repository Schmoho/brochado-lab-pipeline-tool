{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CueP and its homologues, a copper-binding periplasmic metallochaperone identified in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ([swissprot:A0A0D6I4A2]). CueP has been implicated in the transfer of copper ions to SodCII in the periplasm. Its crystal structure has been determined, revealing a V-shaped dimeric structure [[cite:PUB00105558]]. Each monomer is composed of two domains, N-terminal α/β domain and a C-terminal Ig-like domain. Many members of this family, although not CueP itself, are lipoproteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gqz", "name" "Crystal Structure of S.CueP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038094" "CueP family metal-binding protein"}, "pfam" {"PF21172" "Periplasmic copper-binding protein CueP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Periplasmic metallochaperone CueP-like", "short" "CueP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 406, "taxa" 1787, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1719, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1719, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1411}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047808", :literature {"PUB00105558" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 10", "authors" ["Yoon BY" "Kim YH" "Kim N" "Yun BY" "Kim JS" "Lee JH" "Cho HS" "Lee K" "Ha NC."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr", "title" "Structure of the periplasmic copper-binding protein CueP from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1867-75", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24100307}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047808", "name" "Periplasmic metallochaperone CueP-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 23, "alignment:full" 473}}}
