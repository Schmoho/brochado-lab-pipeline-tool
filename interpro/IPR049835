{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Sensor histidine kinase RppB from Synechocystis sp. ([swissprot:Q55932]) and similar proteins from cyanobacterial species. RppB is member of two-component regulatory system RppA/RppB, involved in the establishment of the appropriate stoichiometry between the 2 photosystems. It senses changes in the plastoquinone (PQ) redox poise [[cite:PUB00152879]]. It has also been reported that the RppA/RppB two-component pair (also known as NrsR/NrsS) regulates the nickel-dependent expression of the nrsBACD operon [[cite:PUB00152878]]. It has been suggested that the photosystem-related activities are a result of the expression of NrsS (formerly RppB) in the absence of its natural substrate NrsR (formerly RppA) [[cite:PUB00152878]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041735" "two-component system sensor histidine kinase RppB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sensor histidine kinase RppB", "short" "RppB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 131, "taxa" 727, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 560, "sets" 0, "proteins" 560, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 396}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
