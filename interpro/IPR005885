This enzyme is found in eukaryotes and archaea, but never in bacteria. It consists of a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase domain in the C terminus and a predicted RNA-binding THUMP (thiouridine synthases, RNA methyltransferases, and pseudouridine synthases) domain in the N terminus [[cite:PUB00074050]].
