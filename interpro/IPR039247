{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the RNA-binding protein KhpB, also known as RNA-binding protein Jag/EloR, a RNA chaperone that forms a complex with KhpA and binds to cellular RNA, controlling its expression. It plays a role in peptidoglycan (PG) homeostasis and cell length regulation, cell division and maintenance of cell shape [[cite:PUB00100215], [cite:PUB00100213], [cite:PUB00100214]]. Bacillus subtilis KhpB/Jag is associated with SpoIIIJ, a gene necessary for the third stage of sporulation [[cite:PUB00003117]]. These proteins consist of an N-terminal Jag-domain of unknown function and two RNA-binding domains, a type II KH domain (KH-II) and R3H, at the C-terminal end.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038247", "name" "Jag, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041568" "RNA-binding cell elongation regulator Jag/EloR"}, "hamap" {"MF_00867" "RNA-binding protein KhpB [khpB]"}, "panther" {"PTHR35800" "PROTEIN JAG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding protein KhpB", "short" "KhpB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4258, "taxa" 17273, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19963, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19963, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15281}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039247", :literature {"PUB00100215" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Winther AR" "Kjos M" "Stamsas GA" "Havarstein LS" "Straume D."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Prevention of EloR/KhpA heterodimerization by introduction of site-specific amino acid substitutions renders the essential elongasome protein PBP2b redundant in Streptococcus pneumoniae.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "3681", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30842445}, "PUB00100213" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zheng JJ" "Perez AJ" "Tsui HT" "Massidda O" "Winkler ME."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Absence of the KhpA and KhpB (JAG/EloR) RNA-binding proteins suppresses the requirement for PBP2b by overproduction of FtsA in Streptococcus pneumoniae D39.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "793-814", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28941257}, "PUB00100214" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ulrych A" "Holeckova N" "Goldova J" "Doubravova L" "Benada O" "Kofronova O" "Halada P" "Branny P."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Microbiol", "title" "Characterization of pneumococcal Ser/Thr protein phosphatase phpP mutant and identification of a novel PhpP substrate, putative RNA binding protein Jag.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "247", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27776484}, "PUB00003117" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Errington J" "Appleby L" "Daniel RA" "Goodfellow H" "Partridge SR" "Yudkin MD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
