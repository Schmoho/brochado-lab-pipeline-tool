{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial arsenical resistance operon trans-acting repressor ArsD proteins. ArsD is a trans-acting repressor of the arsRDABC operon that confers resistance to arsenicals and antimonials in Escherichia coli. It possesses two-pairs of vicinal cysteine residues, Cys(12)-Cys(13) and Cys(112)-Cys(113), that potentially form separate binding sites for the metalloids that trigger dissociation of ArsD from the operon. However, as a homodimer it has four vicinal cysteine pairs [[cite:PUB00013437]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3kgk", "name" "Crystal structure of ArsD"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06953" "Arsenical resistance operon protein ArsD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenical-resistance operon trans-acting repressor ArsD", "short" "Arsenical-R_ArsD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 736, "taxa" 4040, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3381, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3381, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2661}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010712", :literature {"PUB00013437" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Li S" "Rosen BP" "Borges-Walmsley MI" "Walmsley AR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
