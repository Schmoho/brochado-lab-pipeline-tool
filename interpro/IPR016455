{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) from plants [[cite:PUB00074925]]. Xyloglucan is a soluble hemicellulose with a backbone of beta-1,4-linked glucose units, partially substituted with alpha-1,6-linked xylopyranose branches. It binds noncovalently to cellulose, cross-linking the adjacent cellulose microfibrils, giving it a key structural role as a matrix polymer. XTHs catalyses xyloglucan endohydrolysis (XEH) and/or endotransglycosylation (XET) and are involved in the modification of cell wall structure by cleaving and, often, also re-joining xyloglucan molecules in primary plant cell walls [[cite:PUB00074924]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1umz", "name" "Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase in complex with the xyloglucan nonasaccharide XLLG."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02176" "Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, member of glycosyl hydrolase family 16"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005604" "Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase", "short" "XTH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 250, "taxa" 1100, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12792, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12366, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7280}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
