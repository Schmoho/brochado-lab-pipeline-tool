{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of enzymes belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 63 ([cazy:GH63]). They catalyse the specific cleavage of the non-reducing terminal glucose residue from Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2). Mannosyl oligosaccharide glucosidase [ec:3.2.1.106] is the first enzyme in the N-linked oligosaccharide processing pathway.</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes glucosylglycerate hydrolase which catalyses the hydrolysis of glucosylglycerate to glycerate and glucose, during the mycobacterial recovery from nitrogen starvation. This process promotes the rapid mobilisation of the glucosylglycerate that accumulates under these conditions. This enzyme can also hydrolyse mannosylglycerate with lower efficiency [[cite:PUB00094228]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>O-Glycosyl hydrolases ([ec:3.2.1.]) are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety.
