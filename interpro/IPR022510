{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This histidine kinase protein is paired with an adjacent response regulator ([ncbifam:TIGR03787]) gene. It co-occurs with a variant sortase enzyme ([ncbifam:TIGR03784]), usually in the same gene neighbourhood, in proteobacterial species most of which are marine, and with an LPXTG motif-containing sortase target conserved protein ([ncbifam:TIGR03788]). Sortases and LPXTG proteins are far more common in Gram-positive bacteria, where sortase systems mediate attachment to the cell wall or cross-linking of pilin structures. We give this predicted sensor histidine kinase the gene symbol psdS, for Proteobacterial Dedicated Sortase system Sensor histidine kinase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03785" "proteobacterial dedicated sortase system histidine kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sortase system, histidine kinase", "short" "Sortase_His-kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 111, "taxa" 543, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 508, "sets" 0, "proteins" 508, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 380}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0859", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0859"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022510", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022510", "name" "Sortase system, histidine kinase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
