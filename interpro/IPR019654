{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit L (NdhL) is a component of the NDH-1L complex that is one of the proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases that catalyse the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone linked with proton translocation across the membrane. NDH-1L is essential for photoheterotrophic cell growth. NdhL appears to contain two transmembrane helices and it is necessary for the functioning of though not the correct assembly of the NDH-1 complex in Synechocystis 6803. The conservation between cyanobacteria and green plants suggests that chloroplast NDH-1 complexes contain related subunits [[cite:PUB00044393]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01355" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit L [ndhL]"}, "pfam" {"PF10716" "NADH dehydrogenase transmembrane subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit L", "short" "NADH-quinone_OxRdatse_su_L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 409, "taxa" 2122, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1194, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 808}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
