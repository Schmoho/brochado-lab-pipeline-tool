{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of fungal proteins which belongs to the Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein family (FITM), including acyl-coenzyme A diphosphatase YFT2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast orthologue of human FIT2 [[cite:PUB00096684]]. This protein is required for ER membrane biosynthesis in response to ER stress, for maintaining ER structure and for lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis [[cite:PUB00096683]].
