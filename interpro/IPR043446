{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the SAM domains-containing proteins such as Neurabin-1/Neurabin-2 and SAMD14 (Sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 14). Most of them are multidomain proteins and in addition to SAM domain they contain other protein-binding domains such as PDZ and actin-binding domains. Members of this family participate in signal transduction. Neurabin-1 is involved in the regulation of Ca(2+) signaling intensity in alpha-adrenergic receptors [[cite:PUB00094035]]. It forms a functional pair of opposing regulators with neurabin-2. Neurabins are expressed almost exclusively in neuronal cells. They are known to interact with protein phosphatase 1 and inhibit its activity [[cite:PUB00094033]]. They also can bind actin filaments [[cite:PUB00094034]].</p>\n\n<p>The function of SAMD14 is not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3egg", "name" "Crystal structure of a complex between Protein Phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1) and the PP1 binding and PDZ domains of Spinophilin"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16154" "NEURABIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neurabin-like family", "short" "Neurabin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1033, "taxa" 4161, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6912, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6912, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3326}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043446", :literature {"PUB00094033" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["McAvoy T" "Allen PB" "Obaishi H" "Nakanishi H" "Takai Y" "Greengard P" "Nairn AC" "Hemmings HC Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Regulation of neurabin I interaction with protein phosphatase 1 by phosphorylation.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "12943-9", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10504266}, "PUB00094035" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Wang X" "Zeng W" "Kim MS" "Allen PB" "Greengard P" "Muallem S."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Spinophilin/neurabin reciprocally regulate signaling intensity by G protein-coupled receptors.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "2768-76", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17464283}, "PUB00094034" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["MacMillan LB" "Bass MA" "Cheng N" "Howard EF" "Tamura M" "Strack S" "Wadzinski BE" "Colbran RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
