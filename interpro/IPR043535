{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes protein 1 found in association with tubulins epsilon and delta complex. This complex is required for centriole maintenance and it has been demonstrated that it is a component of several ciliary structures. It acts as a positive regulator of ciliary hedgehog signalling which plays key roles in embryonic development and in cancers [[cite:PUB00094182]]. \nAdditionally, this protein may play a role in counteracting perturbation of actin filaments, such as after treatment with the actin depolymerising microbial metabolite Chivosazole F [[cite:PUB00094181]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35076" "TUBULIN EPSILON AND DELTA COMPLEX PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tubulin epsilon and delta complex protein 1", "short" "TEDC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 707, "taxa" 2718, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1336, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1336, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 892}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043535", :literature {"PUB00094182" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Breslow DK" "Hoogendoorn S" "Kopp AR" "Morgens DW" "Vu BK" "Kennedy MC" "Han K" "Li A" "Hess GT" "Bassik MC" "Chen JK" "Nachury MV."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
