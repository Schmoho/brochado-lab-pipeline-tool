{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are found in eukaryotes. There are two conserved sequence motifs: GFC and GLL. This family is also known as UPF0704, whose members include FAP206, a protein associated with cilia and flagella.  In the ciliate Tetrahymena, the cilium has radial spokes, each of which is a macromolecular complex essential for motility.  A triplet of three radial spokes, RS1, RS2, and RS3, is repeated every 96 nm along the doublet microtubule. Each spoke has a distinct base that docks to the doublet and is linked to different inner dynein arms. Knockout of the FAP206 gene results in slow cell motility and the 96-nm repeats lack RS2 and dynein c.  FAP206 is probably part of the front prong and docks RS2 and dynein c to the microtubule [[cite:PUB00082324]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12018" "Domain of unknown function"}, "panther" {"PTHR21442" "CILIA- AND FLAGELLA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 206"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 206", "short" "FAP206"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 1023, "taxa" 4122, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2324, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2190, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1444}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021897", :literature {"PUB00082324" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Vasudevan KK" "Song K" "Alford LM" "Sale WS" "Dymek EE" "Smith EF" "Hennessey T" "Joachimiak E" "Urbanska P" "Wloga D" "Dentler W" "Nicastro D" "Gaertig J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
