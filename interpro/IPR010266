{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial NnrS like proteins. NnrS is a haem-Cu protein (NnrS) and a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase family [[cite:PUB00011924]]. Expression of nnrS is dependent on the transcriptional regulator NnrR, which also regulates expression of genes required for the reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide, including nirK and nor. NnrS is a haem- and copper-containing membrane protein. Genes encoding putative orthologues of NnrS are sometimes but not always found in bacteria encoding nitrite and/or nitric oxide reductase [[cite:PUB00011925]]. NnrS contributes to nitrosative-stress tolerance in V. cholerae and protects the cellular iron pool from the formation of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs), thus protecting critical metabolic pathways from inhibition [[cite:PUB00098477], [cite:PUB00098478]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05940" "NnrS protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NnrS", "short" "NnrS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 1631, "taxa" 7016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9036, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6699}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010266", :literature {"PUB00011924" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Honisch U" "Zumft WG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
