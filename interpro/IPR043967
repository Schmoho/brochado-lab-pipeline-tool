{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In protozoa of the family Trypanosomatidae RNA polymerase II (Pol II) generates polycistronic pre-mRNAs which are then processed by trans-splicing and polyadenylation to produce monocistronic mature mRNAs. Trans-splicing transfers the 39-nucleotide (nt)-long capped spliced leader (SL) from the SL RNA to the 5' end of mRNAs. The mRNA cap in these organisms has the unusual feature of containing, in addition to 7-methylguanosine, four modified nucleotides making it by definition a cap 4 structure (m7equation M2AmpAmpCmpm3Um) which appears to be conserved across this family. This highly modified cap is essential for utilisation of the SL RNA during the trans-splicing process, a key event in RNA metabolism [[cite:PUB00094649],  [cite:PUB00094648]]. In yeast and human cells, nuclear cap binding complexes (CBCs) consists of two subunits, cap binding proteins 20 and 80 (CBP20 and CBP80), the first being highly conserved from yeast to humans and contains an RNA binding motif. In Trypanosomatidae family, this complex consists of five subunits, the highly conserved CBP20 subunit, an alpha-importin which imports the complex from the cytoplasm similar to the yeast and human counterparts and three subunits that appear to be unique for this family of organisms, namely CBP30, CBP66 and CBP110 [[cite:PUB00094649]]. The CBC complex in trypanosomatids are essential for cell viability.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the CBP30 subunit of the trypanasome nuclear cap-binding complex.
