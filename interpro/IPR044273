{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant transcription factors that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, including PIF3/PIF3-like from Arabidopsis,  and APG/PIL15 from rice.</p>\n\n<p>Phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs) are transcription factors that regulate various light responses [[cite:PUB00101405]]. PIF3 (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3) is a phytochrome-interacting bHLH factor that targets G-box motifs through its bHLH domain [[cite:PUB00095699]]. PIF3 binds to phytochrome B, and the PAS domain of PIF3 is a major contributor to this interaction [[cite:PUB00095700]]. PIF3, together with PIF4/5, plays a key role promoting dark-induced senescence.</p>\n\n<p>In rice PIL15 plays important roles in red light-mediated (phyA and/or phyB-dependent) signal transduction pathways [[cite:PUB00095702]]. APG interacts with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), and this interaction represents a grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1 [[cite:PUB00095701]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46807" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR PIF3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor PIF3-like", "short" "PIF3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 247, "taxa" 1021, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2969, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2969, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1797}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044273", :literature {"PUB00101405" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hao C" "Yang Y" "Du J" "Deng XW" "Li L."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "The PCY-SAG14 phytocyanin module regulated by PIFs and miR408 promotes dark-induced leaf senescence in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e2116623119", "volume" "119", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35022242}, "PUB00095699" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5467", "authors" ["Martinez-Garcia JF" "Huq E" "Quail PH."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Direct targeting of light signals to a promoter element-bound transcription factor.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "859-63", "volume" "288", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10797009}, "PUB00095700" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Zhu Y" "Tepperman JM" "Fairchild CD" "Quail PH."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Phytochrome B binds with greater apparent affinity than phytochrome A to the basic helix-loop-helix factor PIF3 in a reaction requiring the PAS domain of PIF3.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "13419-24", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11069292}, "PUB00095701" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Heang D" "Sassa H."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e31325", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22363621}, "PUB00095702" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Nakamura Y" "Kato T" "Yamashino T" "Murakami M" "Mizuno T."], "ISO_journal" "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "title" "Characterization of a set of phytochrome-interacting factor-like bHLH proteins in Oryza sativa.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1183-91", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17485859}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044273", "name" "Transcription factor PIF3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
