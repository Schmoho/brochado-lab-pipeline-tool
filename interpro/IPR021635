{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ToxA is produced by particular Pyrenophora triticirepentis races and is a proteinaceous host-selective toxin. It is necessary and sufficient to cause cell death in sensitive wheat cultivars [[cite:PUB00038931]]. ToxA adopts a single-domain, Î²-sandwich fold which has novel topology. The protein is directly involved in recognition events required for ToxA action, which involves several recognition events, is mediated by an important solvent-exposed Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) containing loop. This structure is remarkably similar to the classic mammalian RGD-containing domain, the fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain. It is thought to be distantly related to mammalian FnIII proteins, gaining entry to the host via an integrin-like receptor in the plant host [[cite:PUB00038931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1zld", "name" "Crystal structure of a RGD-containing host-selective toxin: Pyrenophora tritici-repentis Ptr ToxA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038701", "name" "ToxA superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11584" "Proteinaceous host-selective toxin ToxA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteinaceous host-selective toxin ToxA", "short" "Toxin_ToxA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 38, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 54, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 52}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021635", :literature {"PUB00038931" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Sarma GN" "Manning VA" "Ciuffetti LM" "Karplus PA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.034918", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Structure of Ptr ToxA: an RGD-containing host-selective toxin from Pyrenophora tritici-repentis.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3190-202", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16214901}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021635", "name" "Proteinaceous host-selective toxin ToxA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 4}}}
