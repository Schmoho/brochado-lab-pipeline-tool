{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains the P18 proteins of citrus tristeza virus (CTV). CTV is a member of the closterovirus group and is one of the more complex single-stranded RNA viruses. Assembly of the viral genome into virions is a critical process of the virus life cycle often defining the ability of the virus to move within the plant and to be transmitted horizontally to other plants. Closteroviridae virions are polar helical rods assembled primarily by a major coat protein, but with a related minor coat protein at one end. It is the only virus family that encodes a protein with similarity to cellular chaperones, a 70kDa heat-shock protein homologue (HSP70h).  Deletion mutagenesis reveals that p33, p6, p18, p13, p20, and p23 genes are not needed for virion formation. Their function is unknown [[cite:PUB00011543]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05520" "Citrus tristeza virus P18 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrus tristeza virus P18", "short" "CTV_P18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 13, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 172, "sets" 0, "proteins" 172, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008452", :literature {"PUB00011543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Satyanarayana T" "Gowda S" "Mawassi M" "Albiach-Marti MR" "Ayllon MA" "Robertson C" "Garnsey SM" "Dawson WO."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.2000.0638", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Closterovirus encoded HSP70 homolog and p61 in addition to both coat proteins function in efficient virion assembly.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "253-65", "volume" "278", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11112500}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008452", "name" "Citrus tristeza virus P18", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 1}}}
