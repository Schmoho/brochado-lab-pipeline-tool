{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins FAM151A and FAM151B are mammalian homologues of C. elegans menorin, which is involved in generation of neurons and regulation of dendrite extension [[cite:PUB00100987], [cite:PUB00100988]]. FAM151B has been shown to be essential for retinal function [[cite:PUB00100987]]. Sequence analysis and the fact that these proteins have a TIM-barrel fold similar to that in phospholipase D and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD) families, indicate that they belong to PLC-like phosphodiesterase superfamily, although their substrates and function remain unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10223" "Menorin"}, "panther" {"PTHR21184" "MENORIN (DENDRITIC BRANCHING PROTEIN)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Menorin", "short" "Memorin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 43, "proteomes" 1014, "taxa" 4198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2666, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2478, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1657}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019356", :literature {"PUB00100988" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Tang LTH" "Trivedi M" "Freund J" "Salazar CJ" "Rahman M" "Ramirez-Suarez NJ" "Lee G" "Wang Y" "Grant BD" "Bulow HE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "The CATP-8/P5A-type ATPase functions in multiple pathways during neuronal patterning.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e1009475", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34197450}, "PUB00100987" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Findlay AS" "McKie L" "Keighren M" "Clementson-Mobbs S" "Sanchez-Pulido L" "Wells S" "Cross SH" "Jackson IJ."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Fam151b, the mouse homologue of C.elegans menorin gene, is essential for retinal function.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "437", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31949211}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019356", "name" "Menorin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 53, "alignment:full" 1892}}}
