{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HTLV-1 encodes two proteins that have been reported to drive oncogenesis: Tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ). HBZ has been shown to enhance viral infectivity and persistence, and facilitates proliferation of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00094705]]. It has also been shown to attenuates DSB (double-stranded DNA breaks) repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in a manner dependent upon the bZIP domain [[cite:PUB00094706]].</p>\n\n<p>HBZ has been shown to negatively regulate basal and Tax-dependent HTLV-1 transcription through its ability to interact with specific basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. HBZ has been shown to reduce HTLV-1 transcription and virion production. The protein interacts with CREB in vivo and directly in vitro via the bZIP domain of each protein; CREM-Ia and ATF-1 also interact with HBZ-bZIP. The interaction between CREB and HBZ prevents CREB binding to the viral CRE elements in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the reduction in HTLV-1 transcription by HBZ partly results from the the loss of CREB at the promoter. It has also been shown that HBZ displaces CREB from a cellular CRE, suggesting that HBZ may de-regulate CREB-dependent cellular gene expression [[cite:PUB00060235]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02097" "HTLV-1 basic zipper factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTLV-1 basic zipper factor", "short" "HTLV1ZIPPER"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 441, "sets" 0, "proteins" 90, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026220", :literature {"PUB00060235" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lemasson I" "Lewis MR" "Polakowski N" "Hivin P" "Cavanagh MH" "Thebault S" "Barbeau B" "Nyborg JK" "Mesnard JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
