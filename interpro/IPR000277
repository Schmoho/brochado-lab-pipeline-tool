These enzymes are proteins of about 400 amino-acid residues. The pyridoxal-P group is attached to a lysine residue located in the central section of these enzymes.</p>\n\n<p>One of these enzymes is the sulfhydrylase FUB7 from fungi such as Gibberella and Fusarium. The gene is part of a cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of fusaric acid, a mycotoxin with low to moderate toxicity to animals and humans, but with high phytotoxic properties [[cite:PUB00082323]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Pyridoxal phosphate is the active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine or pyridoxal). Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is a versatile catalyst, acting as a coenzyme in a multitude of reactions, including decarboxylation, deamination and transamination  [[cite:PUB00035505], [cite:PUB00006322], [cite:PUB00035506]]. PLP-dependent enzymes are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids and amino acid-derived metabolites, but they are also found in the biosynthetic pathways of amino sugars and in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters; pyridoxal phosphate can also inhibit DNA polymerases and several steroid receptors  [[cite:PUB00035507]]. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain can cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy [[cite:PUB00035508]].</p>\n\n<p>PLP enzymes exist in their resting state as a Schiff base, the aldehyde group of PLP forming a linkage with the ε-amino group of an active site lysine residue on the enzyme. The α-amino group of the substrate displaces the lysine ε-amino group, in the process forming a new aldimine with the substrate. This aldimine is the common central intermediate for all PLP-catalysed reactions, enzymatic and non-enzymatic [[cite:PUB00035504]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8sa9", "name" "Crystal Structure of Cystathionine beta lyase from Klebsiella aerogenes, PLP-Oxamate Adduct (C2 form)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00614" "CGS_like"}, "pfam" {"PF01053" "Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme"}, "panther" {"PTHR11808" "TRANS-SULFURATION ENZYME FAMILY MEMBER"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001434" "Cystathionine gamma-synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cys/Met metabolism, pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme", "short" "Cys/Met-Metab_PyrdxlP-dep_enz"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 152, "domain_architectures" 368, "proteomes" 11313, "taxa" 42444, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 137167, "sets" 0, "proteins" 136687, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101809}, "pathways" 119}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00677", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00677"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1654", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1654"} {"accession" "GenProp1238", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1238"} {"accession" "GenProp1685", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1685"} {"accession" "GenProp1507", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1507"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
