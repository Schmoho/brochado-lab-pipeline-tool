{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Segregation of nuclear and cytoplasmic processes facilitates regulation of many eukaryotic cellular functions such as gene expression and cell cycle progression. Trafficking through the nuclear pore requires a number of highly conserved soluble factors that escort macromolecular substrates into and out of the nucleus. The Mog1 protein has been shown to interact with RanGTP, which stimulates guanine nucleotide release, suggesting Mog1 regulates the nuclear transport functions of Ran [[cite:PUB00015069]]. The human homologue of Mog1 is thought to be alternatively spliced.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jhs", "name" "Protein Mog1 E65A mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016123", "name" "Mog1/PsbP, alpha/beta/alpha sandwich", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15837" "RAN GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE RELEASE FACTOR"}, "cdd" {"cd00224" "Mog1"}, "pfam" {"PF04603" "Ran-interacting Mog1 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ran-interacting Mog1 protein", "short" "Mog1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 51, "proteomes" 1905, "taxa" 6177, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3985, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3959, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2570}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007681", :literature {"PUB00015069" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Steggerda SM" "Paschal BM."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0854.2001.21109.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Identification of a conserved loop in Mog1 that releases GTP from Ran.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "804-11", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11733047}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007681", "name" "Ran-interacting Mog1 protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 119, "alignment:full" 1800}}}
