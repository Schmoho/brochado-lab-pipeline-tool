{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents alpha-1B-glycoproteins and several leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors. There are five domains in human alpha 1B-glycoprotein.  Mongoose antihemorrhagic factor (AHF1) is a protein, which is homologous to human alpha 1BG, and a supergene family of immunoglobulins [[cite:PUB00043474]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha-1B-glycoproteins have been found associated with a number of diseases. They have been detected in the urine of children with steroid-resistant minimal change nephrotic syndrome (SRINS) [[cite:PUB00043475]]. It is also found associated with bladder cancer, having been detected in all tumor-bearing patient samples but not samples obtained from non-tumor-bearing individuals [[cite:PUB00043476]]. When the 1694 bp was cloned from human liver Marathon cDNA, which is the alpha-1B glycoprotein precursor gene, it was found that it may be a novel member of immunoglobulin superfamily and could be involved in cell recognition and the regulation of cell behavior [[cite:PUB00043477]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polymorphism of Alpha-1-B-glycoprotein (A1BG) has been found in the plasma of several human populations of the Indian subcontinent [[cite:PUB00043478]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001979" "Predicted alpha-1B-glycoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-1B-glycoprotein/leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor", "short" "A1B_glyco/leuk_Ig-like_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 93, "taxa" 361, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 390, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 274}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016332", :literature {"PUB00043474" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Qi ZQ" "Yonaha K" "Tomihara Y" "Toyama S."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0041-0101(94)00146-Y", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Isolation of peptides homologous to domains of human alpha 1B-glycoprotein from a mongoose antihemorrhagic factor.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "241-5", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7597727}, "PUB00043475" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Huang YJ" "Huang SM" "Zhang AH" "Zheng G" "Chen RH."], "ISO_journal" "Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao", "title" "[Comparison of urinary proteomics between steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant minimal change nephrotic syndrome in children]", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1507-10", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17959526}, "PUB00043476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Kreunin P" "Zhao J" "Rosser C" "Urquidi V" "Lubman DM" "Goodison S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
