SoxB has sequence similarity to the 5'-nucleotidase family of enzymes, which catalyse the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphate groups from nucleotides [[cite:PUB00019071]]. This sequence similarity suggests that SoxB also carries out a hydrolytic reaction, probably the hydrolysis of a sulfur-sulfur bond, though this activity has not been demonstrated.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wdc", "name" "Termus thermophilus Sulfate thiohydrolase SoxB in complex with glycerol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04486" "thiosulfohydrolase SoxB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiosulfohydrolase SoxB", "short" "Thiosulf_SoxB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 729, "taxa" 2869, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2802, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2802, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2117}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1088", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1088"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030998", :literature {"PUB00050114" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sauve V" "Roversi P" "Leath KJ" "Garman EF" "Antrobus R" "Lea SM" "Berks BC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
