{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N-linked glycosylation is a ubiquitous protein modification, and is essential for viability in eukaryotic cells. A lipid-linked core-oligosaccharide is assembled at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and transferred to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptide chains by the oligosaccharyl transferase (OTase) complex [[cite:PUB00008145]].</p>\n\n<p>This family consists of the oligsacharyl transferase STT3 subunit and related proteins. The STT3 subunit is part of the oligosccharyl transferase (OTase) complex of proteins and is required for its activity [[cite:PUB00008145]]. In eukaryotes, OTase transfers a lipid-linked core-oligosaccharide to selected asparagine residues in the ER. In the archaea STT3 occurs alone, rather than in an OTase complex, and is required for N-glycosylation of asparagines [[cite:PUB00057883], [cite:PUB00050259]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3vu0", "name" "Crystal structure of the C-terminal globular domain of oligosaccharyltransferase (AfAglB-S2, AF_0040, O30195_ARCFU) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13872" "DOLICHYL-DIPHOSPHOOLIGOSACCHARIDE--PROTEIN GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oligosaccharyl transferase, STT3 subunit", "short" "Oligo_trans_STT3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 47, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3059, "taxa" 12242, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14047, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14047, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9506}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
