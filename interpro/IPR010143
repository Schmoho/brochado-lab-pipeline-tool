{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents all three varieties (Fe-Fe, Mo-Fe and V-Fe) of the component I alpha chain of nitrogenase.</p>\n\n<p>Nitrogenase ([ec:1.18.6.1]) [[cite:PUB00005343]] is the enzyme system responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase is an oligomeric complex which consists of two components: component 2 is an homodimer of an iron-sulphur protein, while component 1 which contains the active site for the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia exists in three different forms: the molybdenum-iron containing protein (MoFe) is a hetero-tetramer consisting of two pairs of alpha (nifD) and beta (nifK) subunits; the vanadium-iron containing protein (VFe) is a hexamer of two pairs each of alpha (vnfD), beta (vnfK), and delta (vnfG) subunits; the third form seems to only contain iron and is a hexamer composed of alpha (anfD), beta (anfK), and delta (anfG) subunits. The alpha and beta chains of the three types of component 1 are evolutionary related and they are also related to proteins nifE and nifN, which are most probably involved in the iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00003737]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5cx1", "name" "Nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein beta-K400E mutant"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43457" "NITROGENASE MOLYBDENUM-IRON PROTEIN ALPHA CHAIN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01862" "nitrogenase component I subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogenase component 1, alpha chain", "short" "Nase_comp1_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 82, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 847, "taxa" 5910, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6571, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6571, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5369}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
