{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Melanoma-derived growth regulatory protein or Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is a 12kDa protein that is secreted from both chondrocytes and malignant melanoma cells. It has effects on cell growth and adhesion and it may play a role in melanoma metastasis and cartilage development. MIA elicits growth inhibition on melanoma cells in vitro. It is possible that secretion of MIA in vivo leads to decreased adhesiveness of melanocytic cells and thereby promotes melanoma progression and invasion [[cite:PUB00093880]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1i1j", "name" "STRUCTURE OF MELANOMA INHIBITORY ACTIVITY PROTEIN: A MEMBER OF A NEW FAMILY OF SECRETED PROTEINS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036028", "name" "SH3-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47312" "MELANOMA-DERIVED GROWTH REGULATORY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Melanoma-derived growth regulatory protein", "short" "MIA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 261, "taxa" 1098, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 441, "sets" 0, "proteins" 441, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 271}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043369", :literature {"PUB00025877" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Lougheed JC" "Holton JM" "Alber T" "Bazan JF" "Handel TM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
