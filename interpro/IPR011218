{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents an insecticidal delta endotoxin from bacteria. The spore-forming bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces several plasmid-encoded delta-endotoxins in large quantities during sporulation, which are packaged into intracellular inclusions as protoxins. The subsequent ingestion of the inclusions by insect larvae leads to the conversion of the different protoxins to toxins, each one specific for an order of insects [[cite:PUB00014563]]. For example, the insecticidal delta-endotoxin cyr15Aa represented in this entry is specific for lepidopteran larvae (butterflies and moths). The toxins act by binding to the midgut epithelial cells forming cation-selective channels in their membranes, causing lethality.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF026584" "Insecticidal delta endotoxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Insecticidal delta endotoxin", "short" "Insecticidal_delta_endotoxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 29, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011218", :literature {"PUB00014563" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Aronson A."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
