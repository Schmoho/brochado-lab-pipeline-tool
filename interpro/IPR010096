{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the 14th (based on Escherichia coli) structural gene, N, of bacterial and chloroplast energy-transducing NADH (or NADPH) dehydrogenases ([ec:1.6.99.5]). This entry does not describe any subunit of the mitochondrial complex I (for which the subunit composition is very different), nor NADH dehydrogenases that are not coupled to ion transport. For chloroplast members, the name NADH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase is used for the complex and this protein is designated as subunit 2 or B. This entry also includes a subunit of a related complex in the archaeal methanogen, Methanosarcina mazei (Methanosarcina frisia), in which F420H2 replaces NADH and 2-hydroxyphenazine replaces the quinone.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01770" "NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit NuoN"}, "hamap" {"MF_00445" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 2, chloroplastic [ndhB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase, subunit N/subunit 2", "short" "NADH-Q_OxRdtase_suN/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 72, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6283, "taxa" 44716, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49402, "sets" 0, "proteins" 49402, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38304}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1608", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1608"} {"accession" "GenProp1198", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1198"} {"accession" "GenProp1537", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1537"} {"accession" "GenProp1341", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1341"} {"accession" "GenProp1583", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1583"} {"accession" "GenProp0135", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0135"} {"accession" "GenProp1751", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1751"} {"accession" "GenProp1254", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1254"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
