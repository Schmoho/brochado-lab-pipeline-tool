{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the human Biorientation of chromosomes in cell division protein 1-like 1 (also known as BOD1L1, [swissprot:Q8NFC6]) and related proteins. BOD1L1 is a component of the fork protection machinery required to protect stalled/damaged replication forks from uncontrolled DNA2-dependent resection [[cite:PUB00093807]]. It acts by stabilising RAD51 at stalled replication forks and protecting RAD51 nucleofilaments from the antirecombinogenic activities of FBH1 and BLM [[cite:PUB00153020], [cite:PUB00153021]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the paralogous BOD1L2 and BOD1 that are required for proper chromosome biorientation through the detection or correction of syntelic attachments in mitotic spindles [[cite:PUB00056115]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47391" "BIORIENTATION OF CHROMOSOMES IN CELL DIVISION 1 LIKE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biorientation of chromosomes in cell division protein 1-like 1", "short" "BOD1L1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 671, "taxa" 2398, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2385, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1092}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043244", :literature {"PUB00153020" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Higgs MR" "Reynolds JJ" "Winczura A" "Blackford AN" "Borel V" "Miller ES" "Zlatanou A" "Nieminuszczy J" "Ryan EL" "Davies NJ" "Stankovic T" "Boulton SJ" "Niedzwiedz W" "Stewart GS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.007", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "BOD1L Is Required to Suppress Deleterious Resection of Stressed Replication Forks.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "462-77", "volume" "59", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26166705}, "PUB00056115" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Porter IM" "McClelland SE" "Khoudoli GA" "Hunter CJ" "Andersen JS" "McAinsh AD" "Blow JJ" "Swedlow JR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
