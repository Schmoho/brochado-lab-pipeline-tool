{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring)-dependent expression A (HdeA) protein is a stress response protein found in highly acid resistant bacteria such as Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli, but which is lacking in mildly acid tolerant bacteria such as Salmonella [[cite:PUB00013251]]. HdeA is one of the most abundant proteins found in the periplasmic space of E. coli, where it is one of a network of proteins that confer an acid resistance phenotype essential for the pathogenesis of enteric bacteria [[cite:PUB00013252]]. HdeA is thought to act as a chaperone, functioning to prevent the aggregation of periplasmic proteins denatured under acidic conditions. The HNS protein, a chromatin-associated protein that influences the gene expression of several environmentally-induced target genes, represses the expression of HdeA. HdeB, which is encoded within the same operon, may form heterodimers with HdeA. HdeA is a single domain Î±-helical [[cite:PUB00013251]] protein with an overall fold that is similar to the fold of the N-terminal subdomain of the GluRS anticodon-binding domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents HdeA and HdeB which are also known as acid stress chaperones.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dj8", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF E.
