{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LpxH (also known as YbbF) is an Escherichia coli UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase thought to catalyse the fourth step of lipid A biosynthesis, in which a precursor UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is hydrolysed to yield 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate and UMP [[cite:PUB00014937]]. YbbF belongs to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily. MPPs are functionally diverse, but all share a conserved domain with an active site consisting of two metal ions (usually manganese, iron, or zinc) coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, aspartate, and asparagine residues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes Escherichia coli LpxH (YbbF) and related proteins.
