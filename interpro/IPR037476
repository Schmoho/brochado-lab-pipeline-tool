{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Protein PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 (also known as PCH1At2g16365) and its homologues including Protein PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1-LIKE (PCHL). Both PCH1 and its homologue, PCHL suppress phyB dark reversion, resulting in plants with dramatically enhanced light sensitivity [[cite:PUB00155429]]. In plants, a photoreceptor called phytochrome B (phyB) responds to red light and regulates the ability of plants to grow. PCH1 regulates photoperiod-responsive growth by integrating the plant clock with light perception pathways. PCH1 stabilizes the structure of phyB so that it remains active, even in the dark. This prolonged activity acts as a molecular memory of prior exposure to light and helps to prevent plants from growing too much in the winter, when there are fewer hours of daylight. PCH1 is also found in other species of plants [[cite:PUB00087011]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36062" "OS01G0687300 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PCH1", "short" "PCH1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 214, "taxa" 833, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 737, "sets" 0, "proteins" 737, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 425}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037476", :literature {"PUB00087011" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Huang H" "Yoo CY" "Bindbeutel R" "Goldsworthy J" "Tielking A" "Alvarez S" "Naldrett MJ" "Evans BS" "Chen M" "Nusinow DA."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13292", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "PCH1 integrates circadian and light-signaling pathways to control photoperiod-responsive growth in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e13292", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26839287}, "PUB00155429" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Enderle B" "Sheerin DJ" "Paik I" "Kathare PK" "Schwenk P" "Klose C" "Ulbrich MH" "Huq E" "Hiltbrunner A."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02311-8", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "PCH1 and PCHL promote photomorphogenesis in plants by controlling phytochrome B dark reversion.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "2221", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29263319}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010099", "name" "regulation of photomorphogenesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR037476", "name" "PCH1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
