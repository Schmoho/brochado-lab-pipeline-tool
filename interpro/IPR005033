{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is named after YEATS (Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, and Sas5), an evolutionarily conserved module present in 4 proteins (ENL, AF9, GAS41, and YEATS2) in humans and 3 proteins (Sas5, Taf14, and Yaf9) in yeast. These proteins are found in major chromatin-remodeling and histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) complexes and implicated in regulation of chromatin structure, histone acetylation and deposition, gene transcription and DNA damage response. The YEATS domain, which as previously shown is found in a number of chromatin-associated proteins, has recently been shown to have the capacity to bind histone lysine acetylation [[cite:PUB00091361]]. The ability of the YEATS domains of human AF9 and yeast Taf14 to recognise the histone mark H3K9ac, have shown that these proteins are members of the family of acetyllysine readers [[cite:PUB00097418]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7eie", "name" "Crystal structure of YEATS2 YEATS domain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038704", "name" "YEATS superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47573" "PROTEIN AF-9 HOMOLOG", "PTHR23195" "YEATS DOMAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YEATS", "short" "YEATS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 34, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2653, "taxa" 10816, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 2, "matches" 8539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8539, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4493}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC51037", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC51037"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005033", :literature {"PUB00091361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Zhang Q" "Zeng L" "Zhao C" "Ju Y" "Konuma T" "Zhou MM."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2016.05.023", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural Insights into Histone Crotonyl-Lysine Recognition by the AF9 YEATS Domain.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1606-12", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27545619}, "PUB00097418" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Shanle EK" "Andrews FH" "Meriesh H" "McDaniel SL" "Dronamraju R" "DiFiore JV" "Jha D" "Wozniak GG" "Bridgers JB" "Kerschner JL" "Krajewski K" "Martin GM" "Morrison AJ" "Kutateladze TG" "Strahl BD."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Association of Taf14 with acetylated histone H3 directs gene transcription and the DNA damage response.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1795-800", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26341557}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005033", "name" "YEATS", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016665", "name" "SAS complex subunit SAS5/transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 14", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
