{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in the transcriptional enhancer factor family (also known as TEAD family, includes TEAD 1 to 4)  play a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a pathway involved in organ size control and tumour suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein MST1/MST2, in complex with its regulatory protein SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ. TEAD transcription factors act by mediating gene expression of YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ, thereby regulating cell proliferation, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction [[cite:PUB00061534], [cite:PUB00063508]].  This entry includes protein Scalloped from<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>which in combination with protein Vestigial promotes wing formation [[cite:PUB00085117]], and in combination with Yorkie which promotes transcriptional activity and movement of Yorkie to the nucleus [[cite:PUB00085118]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002603" "Transcriptional enhancer factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional enhancer factor, metazoa", "short" "TEF_metazoa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 862, "taxa" 3521, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6175, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3775}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016361", :literature {"PUB00063508" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Zhang H" "Liu CY" "Zha ZY" "Zhao B" "Yao J" "Zhao S" "Xiong Y" "Lei QY" "Guan KL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
