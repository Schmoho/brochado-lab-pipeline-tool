{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry contain the highly conserved domain known as the EP domain, which consists of hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges, and an extensive hydrogen bonding network. In Arabidopsis EDS1 (ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1, At3g48090) is a positive regulator of basal resistance and of effector-triggered immunity specifically mediated by Toll-interleukin-1 receptor-nucleotide binding-leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NB-LRR) resistance proteins [[cite:PUB00095510]]. EDS1 associations with senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101) or phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD4) in separate complexes. Despite its homology to eukaryotic lipases, the catalytic activity of EDS1 is dispensable for immune function [[cite:PUB00091506]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes EDS1, EDS1L and EDS1B from Arabidopsis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b28", "name" "Structure of an intron-retention variant of the plant immune signalling protein EDS1 from Vitis vinifera"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47090" "PROTEIN EDS1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EDS1-like", "short" "EDS1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 221, "taxa" 887, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 932, "sets" 0, "proteins" 932, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 531}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044214", :literature {"PUB00091506" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wagner S" "Stuttmann J" "Rietz S" "Guerois R" "Brunstein E" "Bautor J" "Niefind K" "Parker JE."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2013.11.006", "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "Structural basis for signaling by exclusive EDS1 heteromeric complexes with SAG101 or PAD4 in plant innate immunity.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "619-30", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24331460}, "PUB00095510" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6061", "authors" ["Bhattacharjee S" "Halane MK" "Kim SH" "Gassmann W."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Pathogen effectors target Arabidopsis EDS1 and alter its interactions with immune regulators.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1405-8", "volume" "334", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22158819}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006952", "name" "defense response", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044214", "name" "EDS1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
