{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of plants proteins, including nuclear envelope-associated proteins (NEAP) that interact with other proteins of the nuclear envelope. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this family comprises three genes AtNEAP1-3 expressed ubiquitously and a pseudogene AtNEAP4 [[cite:PUB00088445]]. These proteins consist of coiled-coils and localise to the nuclear periphery where they form part of stable protein complexes. They are able to form homo- and heteromers, and interact with the SUN domain proteins AtSUN1 and AtSUN2, which are involved in the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48145" "NUCLEAR ENVELOPE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear envelope-associated protein 1-4", "short" "NEAP1-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 237, "taxa" 892, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 861, "sets" 0, "proteins" 861, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 518}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049932", :literature {"PUB00088445" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Pawar V" "Poulet A" "Detourne G" "Tatout C" "Vanrobays E" "Evans DE" "Graumann K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
