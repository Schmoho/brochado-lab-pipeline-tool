{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of enzymes related to fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. This enzyme catalyses a transaldol reaction between 6-deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate (DKFP) and L-aspartate semialdehyde (ASA) with an elimination of hydroxypyruvaldehyde phosphate to yield 2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonic acid (ADH). It plays a key role in an alternative pathway of the biosynthesis of 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ), which is involved in the canonical pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. It can also catalyse the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) [[cite:PUB00060486], [cite:PUB00060487]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00960" "2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate synthase [aroA']"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01949" "2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate synthase", "short" "ADH_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 321, "taxa" 2105, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2401, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2401, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2064}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
