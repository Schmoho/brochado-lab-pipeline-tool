{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are involved in quorum sensing processes. In Gram-negative bacteria, N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) act as signals. As the bacterial density increases, AHLs accumulate, and once they reach a critical level (quorum), they interact with cognate receptor proteins, which then affect target gene expression. Some AHLs are synthesized by LuxM (AHL synthase) and homologues (VanM and opaM)[[cite:PUB00085309]]. LuxM enzyme uses S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) as one of its two substrates and is capable of using either acyl-acyl-carrier-protein (acyl-ACP) or acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) as the other substrate [[cite:PUB00085310]]. VanM, the LuxM homologue, produces two auto-inducers C6HSL and 3OC6HSL. Both autoinducers are detected by the VanN receptor. The autoinducers HAI-1, is synthesized by the cytoplasmic enzymes LuxM [[cite:PUB00085311]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17327" "Acyl homoserine lactone synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl homoserine lactone synthase", "short" "AHL_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 239, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 175}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
