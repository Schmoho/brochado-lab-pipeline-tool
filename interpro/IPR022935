{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes ClpS from bacteria and chloroplastic CLPS1/2 from plants. ClpS binds directly to N-terminal destabilising residues through its substrate-binding site distal to the ClpS-ClpA interface, and targets these substrates to the ClpAP protease for degradation [[cite:PUB00053947], [cite:PUB00096760]].</p>\n\n<p>ClpS is a small alpha/beta protein that consists of three α-helices connected to three antiparallel β-strands [[cite:PUB00013966]]. The protein has a globular shape, with a curved layer of three antiparallel α-helices over a twisted antiparallel β-sheet. Dimerization of ClpS may occur through its N-terminal domain. This short extended N-terminal region in ClpS is followed by the central seven-residue β-strand, which is flanked by two other β-strands in a small β-sheet.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3dnj", "name" "The structure of the Caulobacter crescentus ClpS protease adaptor protein in complex with a N-end rule peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014719", "name" "Ribosomal protein bL12, C-terminal/adaptor protein ClpS-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33473" "ATP-DEPENDENT CLP PROTEASE ADAPTER PROTEIN CLPS1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "hamap" {"MF_00302" "ATP-dependent Clp protease adapter protein ClpS [clpS]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent Clp protease adaptor protein ClpS", "short" "ClpS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5932, "taxa" 22398, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25109, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19268}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022935", :literature {"PUB00053947" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7077", "authors" ["Erbse A" "Schmidt R" "Bornemann T" "Schneider-Mergener J" "Mogk A" "Zahn R" "Dougan DA" "Bukau B."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature04412", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "ClpS is an essential component of the N-end rule pathway in Escherichia coli.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "753-6", "volume" "439", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16467841}, "PUB00013966" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zeth K" "Ravelli RB" "Paal K" "Cusack S" "Bukau B" "Dougan DA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
