{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a clade of mainly eukaryotic uridine phosphorylases.  Uridine phosphorylase (UP) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uracil ribosides and analogous compounds to their respective nucleobases and ribose 1-phosphate. Human UPP1 has a role in the activation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues used in chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil   [[cite:PUB00071562], [cite:PUB00051804]]. This subfamily belongs to the nucleoside phosphorylase-I (NP-I) family, whose members accept a range of purine nucleosides as well as the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine. The NP-I family is distinct from nucleoside phosphorylase-II, which belongs to a different structural family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3p0f", "name" "Structure of hUPP2 in an inactive conformation with bound 5-benzylacyclouridine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17763" "uridine phosphorylases similar to a human UPP1 and UPP2"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01719" "uridine phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uridine phosphorylase, eukaryotic", "short" "Uridine_phosphorylase_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1002, "taxa" 4000, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2818, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2810, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1870}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1576", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1576"} {"accession" "GenProp1410", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1410"} {"accession" "GenProp1380", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1380"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
