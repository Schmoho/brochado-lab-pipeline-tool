Lipid A anchors lipopolysaccharide (the major constituent of the outer membrane) into the membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. LpxC shows no homology to mammalian metalloamidases and is essential for cell viability, making it an important target for the development of novel antibacterial compounds [[cite:PUB00032543]]. The structure of UDP-3-O-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) from Aquifex aeolicus has a two-layer α/β structure similar to that of the second domain of ribosomal protein S5, only in LpxC there is a duplication giving two structural repeats of this fold, each repeat being elaborated with additional structures forming the active site. LpxC contains a zinc-binding motif, which resides at the base of an active site cleft and adjacent to a hydrophobic tunnel occupied by a fatty acid [[cite:PUB00029703]]. This tunnel accounts for the specificity of LpxC toward substrates and inhibitors bearing appropriately positioned 3-O-fatty acid substituents [[cite:PUB00035690]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3p3g", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Escherichia coli LpxC/LPC-009 complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015870", "name" "UDP-3-O-acyl N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011334", "name" "UDP-3-O-acyl N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33694" "UDP-3-O-ACYL-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE DEACETYLASE 1, MITOCHONDRIAL-RELATED"}, "hamap" {"MF_00388" "UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase [lpxC]"}, "pfam" {"PF03331" "UDP-3-O-acyl N-acetylglycosamine deacetylase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00325" "UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-3-O-acyl N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase", "short" "UDP-acyl_GlcNac_deAcase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 95, "domain_architectures" 57, "proteomes" 5105, "taxa" 22251, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26362, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26210, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19910}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0204", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0204"} {"accession" "GenProp1290", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1290"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
