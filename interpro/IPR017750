{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Type I protein secretion is a system in some Gram-negative bacteria to export proteins (often proteases) across both inner and outer membranes to the extracellular medium. This is one of three proteins of the type I secretion apparatus. Targeted proteins are not cleaved at the N terminus, but rather carry signals located toward the extreme C terminus to direct type I secretion. This model is related to models [interpro:IPR010128] and [interpro:IPR010132], and to bacteriocin ABC transporters that cleave their substrates during export.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03375" "type I secretion system permease/ATPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATPase, type I secretion system", "short" "ATPase_T1SS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1041, "taxa" 5732, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7232, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7232, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5554}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0059", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0059"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017750", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039421", "name" "Type 1 protein exporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005896", "name" "Glucan exporter ATP-binding protein, NdvA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR005897", "name" "Peptidase C39, ABC-type bacteriocin transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010128", "name" "ATPase, type I secretion system, PrtD-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010132", "name" "ATPase, type I secretion system, HlyB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011917", "name" "ABC transporter, lipid A-core flippase, MsbA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011918", "name" "ABC transporter, ATP-binding/permease protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR013305", "name" "ABC transporter Tap-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005293", "name" "Antigen peptide transporter 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR014216", "name" "ABC transporter, CydDC cysteine exporter (CydDC-E) family, permease/ATP-binding protein CydD", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017750", "name" "ATPase, type I secretion system", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022514", "name" "NHPM bacteriocin system ABC transporter, peptidase/ATP-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022515", "name" "NHPM bacteriocin system ABC transporter, ATP-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
