{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents RapZ family. RapZ plays a central role in RNA-mediated regulation of amino-sugar metabolism.  It is a RNA-binding protein that recruits the major endoribonuclease RNase E to sRNAs GlmZ [[cite:PUB00075613]]. Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate diverse cellular processes; GlmY and GlmZ are sRNAs that act hierarchically to activate mRNA glmS, which encodes glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) synthase.</p>\n\n<p>RapZ is composed of two domains [[cite:PUB00150969]]. The N-terminal domain is similar to P-loop nucleotide/nucleoside kinases whereas the C-terminal domain share similarity with a domain found at C terminus of phosphofructokinases. The C-terminal domain of RapZ is sufficient to bind RNA but on its own is incapable in mediating GlmZ processing.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5o5s", "name" "X-ray crystal structure of the RapZ C-terminal domain from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30448" "RNASE ADAPTER PROTEIN RAPZ"}, "hamap" {"MF_00636" "RNase adapter protein RapZ [rapZ]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005052" "Predicted P-loop kinase, YhbJ type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RapZ-like family", "short" "RapZ-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6942, "taxa" 25537, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28420, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28418, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21889}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005337", :literature {"PUB00075613" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Gopel Y" "Papenfort K" "Reichenbach B" "Vogel J" "Gorke B."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.210112.112", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Targeted decay of a regulatory small RNA by an adaptor protein for RNase E and counteraction by an anti-adaptor RNA.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "552-64", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23475961}, "PUB00075614" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Luciano J" "Foulquier E" "Fantino JR" "Galinier A" "Pompeo F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
