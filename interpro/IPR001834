{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Flavoprotein pyridine nucleotide cytochrome reductases [[cite:PUB00002674]] (FPNCR) catalyse the interchange of reducing equivalents between one-electron carriers and the two-electron-carrying nicotinamide dinucleotides. The enzymes include\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>ferredoxin:NADP<sup>+</sup>reductases (FNR) [[cite:PUB00002370]].</li>\r\n<li>plant and fungal NAD(P)H:nitrate reductases [[cite:PUB00002674], [cite:PUB00005356]].</li>\r\n<li>NADH:cytochrome b5 reductases [[cite:PUB00002329]].</li>\r\n<li>NADPH:P450 reductases.</li>\r\n<li>NADPH:sulphite reductases.</li>\r\n<li>nitric oxide synthases.</li>\r\n<li>phthalate dioxygenase reductase.</li>\r\n<li>and various other flavoproteins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase (CBR) serves as electron donor for cytochrome b5, a ubiquitous electron carrier (see [interpro:IPR001199]), thus participating in a variety of metabolic pathways (including steroid biosynthesis, desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, P450-dependent reactions, methaemoglobin reduction, etc.). A membrane-bound form of CBR is located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, while a soluble form is found in erythrocytes [[cite:PUB00002329]]. In the membrane-bound form, the N-terminal residue is myristoylated [[cite:PUB00002397]]. Deficiency of the erythrocyte form causes hereditary methaemoglobinemia [[cite:PUB00004935]].</p>\r\n<p>In biological nitrate assimilation, reduction of nitrate to nitrite is catalysed by the multidomain redox enzyme NAD(P)H:nitrate reductase (NR). Three forms of NR are known: an NADH-specific enzyme found in higher plants and algae ([ec:1.7.1.1]); an NAD(P)H-bispecific enzyme found in higher plants, algae and fungi ([ec:1.7.1.2]); and an NADPH-specific enzyme found only in fungi ([ec:1.7.1.3]) [[cite:PUB00005356]]. NR can be divided into 3 structure/function domains: the molybdopterin cofactor binds in the N-terminal domain; the central region is the cytochrome b domain, which is similar to animal cytochrome b5 (see [interpro:IPR001199]); and the C-terminal portion of the protein is occupied by the FAD/NAD(P)H binding domain, which is similar to CBR [[cite:PUB00005356]]. The catalytic reduction of nitrate to nitrite can be viewed as a single polypeptide electron transport chain with electron flow from NAD(P)H ->FAD ->cytochrome b5 ->molybdopterin ->NO(3). Thus, the flavin domain of NR is functionally identical to CBR.</p>\r\n<p>To date, the 3D-structures of the flavoprotein domain of Zea mays (Maize) nitrate reductase [[cite:PUB00005247]] and of Sus scrofa (Pig) NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase [[cite:PUB00000415]] have been solved. The overall fold is similar to that of ferredoxin:NADP<sup>+</sup>reductase [[cite:PUB00002370]]: the FAD-binding domain (N-terminal) has the topology of an anti-parallel β-barrel, while the NAD(P)-binding domain (C-terminal) has the topology of a classical pyridine dinucleotide-binding fold (i.e. a central parallel β-sheet flanked by 2 helices on each side).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3w5h", "name" "Ultra-high resolution structure of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR039261", "name" "Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR), nucleotide-binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19370" "NADH-CYTOCHROME B5 REDUCTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase-like", "short" "CBR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2695, "taxa" 9358, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16242, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16242, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10499}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
