{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Filaggrins are filament-associated proteins that interact with keratin intermediate filaments of terminally differentiating mammalian epidermis via disulphide bond formation [[cite:PUB00004684], [cite:PUB00098649]]. Filaggrin-2 is essential for normal cell-cell adhesion in the cornified cell layers and important for proper integrity and mechanical strength of the stratum corneum of the epidermis [[cite:PUB00098649]]. They show wide species variations and their aberrant expression has been implicated in a number of keratinising disorders. The proteins are synthesised as large, insoluble, highly-phosphorylated precursors, containing multiple tandem repeats of 324 amino acids, which are not separated by a large linker. The precursor is deposited as keratohyalin granules. During terminal differentiation, it is dephosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00487" "FILAGGRIN"}, "pfam" {"PF03516" "Filaggrin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Filaggrin", "short" "Filaggrin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 43, "proteomes" 56, "taxa" 260, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 55}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003303", :literature {"PUB00004684" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["McKinley-Grant LJ" "Idler WW" "Bernstein IA" "Parry DA" "Cannizzaro L" "Croce CM" "Huebner K" "Lessin SR" "Steinert PM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
