{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mycoplasma genitalium has the smallest known genome of any free-living organism. Its complete genome sequence has been determined by whole genome random sequencing and assembly. Only 470 putative coding regions were identified, including genes for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport and energy metabolism. One family of hypothetical proteins, which includes products of the MG067/MG068/MG395 genes, has been shown to have homologues of similarly unknown function in Mycoplasma pneumoniae.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00840" "Y06768FAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family MG067", "short" "Uncharacterised_MG067"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 176, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2121, "sets" 0, "proteins" 480, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 343}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022381", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022381", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family MG067", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
