{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of bacterial arginine kinases catalyse the transfer of phosphate from ATP to arginine. Protein arginine phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of many critical cellular processes, such as protein degradation, competence and stress responses [[cite:PUB00081098]]. Bacterial protein arginine kinase McsB main targets comprise central factors of the stress response system including the CtsR and HrcA heat shock repressors, as well as major components of the protein quality control system such as the ClpCP protease and the GroEL chaperonine [[cite:PUB00081101]]. McsB has been shown to phosphorylate and inhibit global heat shock repressor CtsR [[cite:PUB00052996]]. Furthermore, McsB is an adaptor for the ClpCP protease. McsB is activated during heat stress by autophosphorylation, allowing the controlled degradation of CtsR by ClpCP [[cite:PUB00081099]]. It is also required for de-localization of competence proteins [[cite:PUB00081100]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fh1", "name" "Protein arginine kinase McsB in the apo state"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014746", "name" "Glutamine synthetase/guanido kinase, catalytic domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07930" "Phosphagen (guanidino) kinases found in bacteria"}, "hamap" {"MF_00602" "Protein-arginine kinase [mcsB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein arginine kinase", "short" "Arg_Kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1192, "taxa" 4594, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5437, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5437, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4025}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
