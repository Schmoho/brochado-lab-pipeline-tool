{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans [WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994)]. This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation.</p>\n\n<p>A number of plant pollen proteins, whose biological function is not yet known, are structurally related [[cite:PUB00001444]]. These proteins are most probably secreted and consist of about 145 residues. There are six cysteines which are conserved in the sequence of these proteins. They seem to be involved in disulphide bonds.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4z8w", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Major Plantain Pollen Allergen Pla l 1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31614" "PROTEIN DOWNSTREAM OF FLC-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pollen allergen Ole e 1 family", "short" "Pollen_Ole_e1_allergen"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 244, "taxa" 1052, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2526, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1591}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006041", :literature {"PUB00001444" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Villalba M" "Batanero E" "Lopez-Otin C" "Sanchez LM" "Monsalve RI" "Gonzalez de la Pena MA" "Lahoz C" "Rodriguez R."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
