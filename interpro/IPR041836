{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rab20 is one of several Rab proteins that appear to be restricted in expression to the apical domain of murine polarized epithelial cells. It is expressed on the apical side of polarized kidney tubule and intestinal epithelial cells, and in non-polarized cells. It also localizes to vesico-tubular structures below the apical brush border of renal proximal tubule cells and in the apical region of duodenal epithelial cells. Rab20 has also been shown to colocalize with vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) in mouse kidney cells, suggesting a role in the regulation of V-ATPase traffic in specific portions of the nephron [[cite:PUB00091922]]. It was also shown to be one of several proteins whose expression is upregulated in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients [[cite:PUB00091923]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04126" "Rab GTPase family 20 (Rab20)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab20", "short" "Rab20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 486, "taxa" 1726, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 607, "sets" 0, "proteins" 607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 436}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041836", :literature {"PUB00020223" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Stenmark H" "Olkkonen VM."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11387043&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The Rab GTPase family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS3007", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11387043}, "PUB00091923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Pellagatti A" "Esoof N" "Watkins F" "Langford CF" "Vetrie D" "Campbell LJ" "Fidler C" "Cavenagh JD" "Eagleton H" "Gordon P" "Woodcock B" "Pushkaran B" "Kwan M" "Wainscoat JS" "Boultwood J."], "ISO_journal" "Br.
