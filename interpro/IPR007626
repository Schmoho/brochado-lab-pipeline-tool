Then the virion egress complex promotes fusion of perinuclear virion envelope with the outer nuclear membrane, releasing viral capsid into the cytoplasm where it will engages budding sites in the Golgi or trans-Golgi network [[cite:PUB00035844], [cite:PUB00053591], [cite:PUB00053592]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6t3x", "name" "Crystal structure of the truncated human cytomegalovirus pUL50-pUL53 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04024" "Nuclear egress protein 2 [NEC2]"}, "pfam" {"PF04541" "Herpesvirus virion protein U34"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus viron egress-type", "short" "Herpesvirus_viron_egress-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 78, "taxa" 363, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 430, "sets" 0, "proteins" 430, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007626", :literature {"PUB00053592" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Simpson-Holley M" "Baines J" "Roller R" "Knipe DM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
