{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a group of functionally uncharacterized hypothetical proteins from archaea and their bacterial homologs. These proteins contain a putative GIY-YIG domain that shows sequence homology with bacterial UvrC DNA repair proteins. Meanwhile, all of them share a C-terminal extension with semi-conserved Cys and His residues, which suggests that the extended region may be a zinc-binding nucleic acid interaction domain. Although the majority of family members have a standalone GIY-YIG domain composition, some of them do have additional endonulcease III domain or sugar fermentation stimulation protein domain, both of which are N-terminally fused to the GIY-YIG domain. As a result, those proteins could perform some other role by cooperating with different domains, which remains to be determined in the future [[cite:PUB00044989]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) it occurs with an endonuclease domain [interpro:IPR003265].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10441" "GIY-YIG domain of hypothetical proteins from archaea and their bacterial homologs"}, "panther" {"PTHR37460" "ENDONUCLEASE III"}, "pfam" {"PF01986" "Domain of unknown function DUF123"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF123", "short" "DUF123"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 23, "proteomes" 507, "taxa" 3517, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3676, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3676, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2990}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
