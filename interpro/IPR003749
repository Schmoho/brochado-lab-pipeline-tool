{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ThiS (thiaminS) is a 66 aa protein involved in sulphur transfer. ThiS is coded in the thiCEFSGH operon in Escherichia coli. This family of proteins have two conserved Glycines at the COOH terminus. Thiocarboxylate is formed at the last G in the activation process. Sulphur is transferred from ThiI to ThiS in a reaction catalysed by IscS [[cite:PUB00007564]]. MoaD, a protein involved in sulphur transfer during molybdopterin synthesis, is about the same length and shows limited sequence similarity to ThiS. Both have the conserved GG at the COOH end [[cite:PUB00035630]].</p>\n\n<p>ThiS/MoaD proteins serve as sulfur carriers in thiamine and tungsten/molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Proteins in this entry also include TtuB from Thermus thermophilus. TtuB functions as the sulfur donor in the sulfurtransferase reaction catalyzed by TtuA [[cite:PUB00088041]]. It is also required for the 2-thiolation of 5-methyluridine residue at position 54 in the T loop of tRNAs, leading to 5-methyl-2-thiouridine (m5s2U or s2T). This modification allows thermal stabilization of tRNAs in thermophilic microorganisms, and is essential for cell growth at high temperatures [[cite:PUB00088042]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2cu3", "name" "Crystal structure of TT1568 from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012675", "name" "Beta-grasp domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016155", "name" "Molybdopterin synthase/thiamin biosynthesis sulphur carrier, beta-grasp", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02597" "ThiS family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfur carrier ThiS/MoaD-like", "short" "ThiS/MoaD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 39, "domain_architectures" 222, "proteomes" 9599, "taxa" 37701, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 79714, "sets" 0, "proteins" 79708, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 61163}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1711", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1711"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
