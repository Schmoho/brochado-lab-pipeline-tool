{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AMP nucleosidase (AMN) catalyses the hydrolysis of AMP to form adenine and ribose 5-phosphate. It is only found in prokaryotes, where it plays a role in purine nucleoside salvage and intracellular AMP level regulation [[cite:PUB00031378]]. The gene for AMP nucleosidase from Escherichia coli (amn) encodes a protein of 483 amino acids. A comparison of the amino acid sequence for AMP nucleosidase with that for yeast AMP deaminase shows that there is a region where only six out of eight amino acids are identical but there is no other overall homology. AMN also showed little similarity to consensus sequences for adenylate binding sites even though the enzyme is known to have a catalytic site for AMP and regulatory sites for MgATP and phosphate [[cite:PUB00013804]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037109", "name" "AMP nucleoside phosphorylase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01932" "AMP nucleosidase [amn]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01717" "AMP nucleosidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AMP nucleosidase", "short" "AMP_nucleosidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1816, "taxa" 6948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7244, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7244, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5763}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
