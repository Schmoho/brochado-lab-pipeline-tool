{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and related proteins which are a family of Mg<sup>++</sup>dependent phosphatases, inhibited by lithium, many of which may act on inositol monophosphate substrate. They dephosphorylate inositol phosphate to generate inositol, which may be recycled into inositol lipids; in eukaryotes IMPase plays a vital role in intracellular signaling [[cite:PUB00081816]]. IMPase is one of the proposed targets of Li<sup>+</sup>therapy in manic-depressive illness [[cite:PUB00004762],  [cite:PUB00081817]]. This family contains some bacterial members of the inositol monophosphatase family classified as SuhB-like. E. coli SuhB has been suggested to participate in posstranscriptional control of gene expression, and its inositol monophosphatase activity doesn't appear to be sufficient for its cellular function. It has been proposed, that SuhB plays a role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol in mycobacteria [[cite:PUB00053644]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qfl", "name" "Structure of SuhB: Inositol monophosphatase and extragenic suppressor from E. coli"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01639" "IMPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inositol monophosphatase", "short" "IMPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8809, "taxa" 33164, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37067, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37040, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27636}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
