{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the fluorescence recovery protein (FRP), the structure of which has been solved for the cyanobacteria Synechocystis (PDBe:4JDQ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyanobacteria contain antenna complexes called phycobilisomes, which are quenched by orange carotenoid protein (OCP) under high light conditions. FRP causes the dissociation of OCP from the phycobilisomes by interacting with the C-terminal domain of OCP, accelerating the conversion of the active red OCP (OCPr) to the inactive orange form (OCPo). A patch of residues (W50, D54, H53, and R60) contributed by both chains of the FRP dimer cause the acceleration of the OCPr to OCPo conversion. Mutation of the absolutely conserved amino acid (R60) affects the activity of FRP [[cite:PUB00091641]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8ag8", "name" "Structure of the Fluorescence Recovery-like protein FRPL from Pseudomonas borbori"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053747", "name" "Fluorescence Recovery Regulator", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF18032" "Photoprotection regulator fluorescence recovery protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fluorescence recovery protein", "short" "FRP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 123, "taxa" 1028, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 608, "sets" 0, "proteins" 608, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 447}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041601", :literature {"PUB00091641" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Sutter M" "Wilson A" "Leverenz RL" "Lopez-Igual R" "Thurotte A" "Salmeen AE" "Kirilovsky D" "Kerfeld CA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
