{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the bacterial nitrogenase iron protein NifH [[cite:PUB00002054]], chloroplast encoded chlL (or frxC) [[cite:PUB00004532]], and archaeal Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide reductive cyclase complex component CfbC [[cite:PUB00087319]].</p>\n\n<p>Nitrogenase ([ec:1.18.6.1]) is responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase is an oligomeric complex which consists of two components: component 1 which contains the active site for the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia and component 2 (also called the iron protein) [[cite:PUB00005343], [cite:PUB00002054]]. Component 2 is a homodimer of a protein (gene nifH) which binds a single 4Fe-4S iron sulfur cluster. In the nitrogen fixation process NifH is first reduced by a protein such as ferredoxin; the reduced protein then transfers electrons to component 1 with the concomitant consumption of ATP [[cite:PUB00002054]].</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of conserved regions in the sequence of these proteins: in the N-terminal section there is an ATP-binding site motif 'A' (P-loop) and in the central section there are two conserved cysteines which have been shown, in NifH, to be the ligands of the 4Fe-4S cluster.</p>\n\n<p>Protochlorophyllide reductase is involved in light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis. The light-independent reaction uses Mg-ATP and reduced ferredoxin to reduce ring D of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to form chlorophyllide a (Chlide). This enzyme complex is composed of three subunits: ChlL, ChlN and ChlB. ChlL (also known as frxC) is present as a homodimer, and binds one 4Fe-4S cluster per dimer. The conserved domains, including the ATP-binding motif and the Fe-S binding motif found in the three subunits, are similar to those in nitrogenases [[cite:PUB00046139]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7qqa", "name" "MgADP-bound Fe protein of the iron-only nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51026" "NIFH_FRXC family profile"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000363" "Nitrogenase iron protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR42864" "LIGHT-INDEPENDENT PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE REDUCTASE IRON-SULFUR ATP-BINDING PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF00142" "4Fe-4S iron sulfur cluster binding proteins, NifH/frxC family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NifH/frxC family", "short" "NifH/frxC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 1602, "taxa" 14348, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 53037, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53031, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 49430}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00580", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00580"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
