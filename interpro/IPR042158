{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C X domain containing 1 (PI-PLCXD1), 2 (PI-PLCXD2) and 3 (PI-PLCXD3), which are bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, [ec:4.6.1.13]) sequence homologs found in animals. The typical eukaryotic phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, [ec:3.1.4.11]) has a multidomain organization that consists of a PLC catalytic core domain, and various regulatory domains. The catalytic core domain is assembled from two highly conserved X- and Y-regions split by a divergent linker sequence. In contrast, members in this group contain a single TIM-barrel type catalytic domain, X domain, and are more closely related to bacterial PI-PLCs, which participate in Ca2+-independent PI metabolism, hydrolyzing the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PI) to produce phosphorylated myo-inositol and diacylglycerol (DAG). Although the biological function of eukaryotic PI-PLCXDs still remains unclear, it may distinct from that of typical eukaryotic PI-PLCs [[cite:PUB00092747], [cite:PUB00080653], [cite:PUB00092748], [cite:PUB00080654]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017946", "name" "PLC-like phosphodiesterase, TIM beta/alpha-barrel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08616" "Catalytic domain of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, X domain containing 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PI-PLC X domain-containing protein 1/2/3", "short" "PLCXD1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 866, "taxa" 3409, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2939, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1939}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042158", :literature {"PUB00092747" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Rhee SG" "Bae YS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
