{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents cytochrome P450, CYP7A1 type. Gene cyp7a1 codes for the enzyme cholesterol 7-alpha-monooxygenase, which catalyses a rate-limiting step in cholesterol catabolism and bile acid biosynthesis by introducing a hydrophilic moiety at position 7 of cholesterol. This enzyme is important for cholesterol homeostasis [[cite:PUB00055610]]. Some of the enzymes belonging to this group are 7-alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one 12-alpha-hydroxylase, also involved in bile acid biosynthesis, and prostacyclin synthase, which catalyses the isomerization of prostaglandin H2 to prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3v8d", "name" "Crystal structure of human CYP7A1 in complex with 7-ketocholesterol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036396", "name" "Cytochrome P450 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000047" "Cytochrome P450, CYP7A1 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome P450, cholesterol 7-alpha-monooxygenase-type", "short" "Cyt_P450_CYP7A1-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 704, "taxa" 2540, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4138, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3977, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2749}, "pathways" 40}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
