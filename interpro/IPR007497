{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from bacteria, archaea and animals, including Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1-binding protein 1 from mouse, which has been named SIMPL (signalling molecule that associates with mouse pelle-like kinase). SIMPL is a component of the IRAK1-dependent TNFRSF1A signaling pathway that leads to NF-kappa-B activation and is required for cell survival. It functions by enhancing RelA transcriptional activity [[cite:PUB00010115], [cite:PUB00101028]]. Separate experiments demonstrate that a mouse family member (named LaXp180) binds the Listeria monocytogenes surface protein ActA, which is a virulence factor that induces actin polymerisation. It may also bind stathmin, a protein involved in signal transduction and in the regulation of microtubule dynamics [[cite:PUB00009982]]. In bacteria its function is unknown, but it is thought to be located in the periplasm or outer membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7c50", "name" "Crystal structure of a Simpl-like protein from Campylobacter jejuni (selenomethionine-incorporated protein)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04402" "Protein of unknown function (DUF541)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1-binding protein 1/DUF541", "short" "SIMPL/DUF541"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 46, "proteomes" 6741, "taxa" 27765, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33838, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33687, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25773}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007497", :literature {"PUB00009982" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pfeuffer T" "Goebel W" "Laubinger J" "Bachmann M" "Kuhn M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
