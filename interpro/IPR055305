{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from plants, including Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma 3 from Arabidopsis thaliana (GG3) [[cite:PUB00155333]]. Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signalling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma 4 from Oryza sativa (DEP1, also known as GGC3), involved in the regulation of grain size [[cite:PUB00155334], [cite:PUB00155335]], also belongs to this entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32378" "GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN SUBUNIT GAMMA 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma 3-like", "short" "GG3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 217, "taxa" 870, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 890, "sets" 0, "proteins" 890, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 557}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055305", :literature {"PUB00155333" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Thung L" "Trusov Y" "Chakravorty D" "Botella JR."], "ISO_journal" "J Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2011.11.010", "medline_journal" "J Plant Physiol", "title" "Gγ1+Gγ2+Gγ3=Gβ: the search for heterotrimeric G-protein γ subunits in Arabidopsis is over.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "542-5", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22209167}, "PUB00155334" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sun S" "Wang L" "Mao H" "Shao L" "Li X" "Xiao J" "Ouyang Y" "Zhang Q."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03141-y", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "A G-protein pathway determines grain size in rice.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "851", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29487318}, "PUB00155335" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cui Y" "Jiang N" "Xu Z" "Xu Q."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-2289-6", "medline_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "title" "Heterotrimeric G protein are involved in the regulation of multiple agronomic traits and stress tolerance in rice.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "90", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32111163}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055305", "name" "Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma 3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
