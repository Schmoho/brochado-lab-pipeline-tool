{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a nuclear membrane plant protein known as constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes 5 (CPR5, also Protein hypersenescence-1), which is part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and play a role in gating [[cite:PUB00096883]]. It is involved in plant growth and immunity [[cite:PUB00096883], [cite:PUB00096881]]. It plays a role in the control of programmed cell death (PCD), acting as a negative regulator of the senescence and chlorotic lesions induced by biotic (e.g. pathogens) and abiotic (e.g. sugars, darkness) agents [[cite:PUB00096879], [cite:PUB00096882], [cite:PUB00096878], [cite:PUB00096880]]. CPR5 also promotes cell division and endoduplication through CPR5-CKI (CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR) signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00096878], [cite:PUB00096884]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35322" "PROTEIN CPR-5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes 5", "short" "CPR5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 241, "taxa" 954, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 745, "sets" 0, "proteins" 745, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 436}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044708", :literature {"PUB00096883" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Faisal MB" "Gechev TS" "Mueller-Roeber B" "Dijkwel PP."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "title" "Putative alternative translation start site-encoding nucleotides of CPR5 regulate growth and resistance.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "295", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32600419}, "PUB00096884" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Peng S" "Sun K" "Guo Y" "Liu Y" "Wang S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "title" "Arabidopsis nucleoporin CPR5 controls trichome cell death through the core cell cycle regulator CKI.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "337-345", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31692196}, "PUB00096878" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Kirik V" "Bouyer D" "Schobinger U" "Bechtold N" "Herzog M" "Bonneville JM" "Hulskamp M."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Biol", "title" "CPR5 is involved in cell proliferation and cell death control and encodes a novel transmembrane protein.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1891-5", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11728314}, "PUB00096879" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Yoshida S" "Ito M" "Nishida I" "Watanabe A."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Identification of a novel gene HYS1/CPR5 that has a repressive role in the induction of leaf senescence and pathogen-defence responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "427-37", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11846876}, "PUB00096880" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wang S" "Gu Y" "Zebell SG" "Anderson LK" "Wang W" "Mohan R" "Dong X."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "A noncanonical role for the CKI-RB-E2F cell-cycle signaling pathway in plant effector-triggered immunity.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "787-94", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25455564}, "PUB00096881" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Perazza D" "Laporte F" "Balague C" "Chevalier F" "Remo S" "Bourge M" "Larkin J" "Herzog M" "Vachon G."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "GeBP/GPL transcription factors regulate a subset of CPR5-dependent processes.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1232-42", "volume" "157", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21875893}, "PUB00096882" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Bowling SA" "Clarke JD" "Liu Y" "Klessig DF" "Dong X."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The cpr5 mutant of Arabidopsis expresses both NPR1-dependent and NPR1-independent resistance.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "1573-84", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9338960}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006952", "name" "defense response", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0010090", "name" "trichome morphogenesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0010150", "name" "leaf senescence", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044708", "name" "Constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
