{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glutathione reductase (GSHR or GRase) from bacteria, animals and fungi. This protein family is one of two closely related subfamilies of GRase, which are also closely related to trypanothione reductase. GRase regenerates glutathione disulphide and NADPH from oxidized glutathione and NADP. In mice, this dimeric enzyme is responsible for an effective innate immune response against bacteria [[cite:PUB00099977]]. In humans, it may be a target for improving the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme as it has been related to drug resistance in glioblastoma cells [[cite:PUB00099976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1k4q", "name" "Human Glutathione Reductase Inactivated by Peroxynitrite"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01421" "glutathione-disulfide reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutathione reductase, eukaryote/bacterial", "short" "Glutathione_Rdtase_euk/bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 39, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2377, "taxa" 9418, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7513, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7512, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5318}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1721", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1721"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
