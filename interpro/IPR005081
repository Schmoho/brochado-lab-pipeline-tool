{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sporulation in bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis involves the formation of a polar septum, which divides the sporangium into a mother cell and a forespore. The sigma E factor, which is encoded within the spoIIG operon, is a cell-specific regulatory protein that directs gene transcription in the mother cell. Sigma E is synthesised as an inactive proprotein pro-sigma E, which is converted to the mature factor by the processing enzyme SpoIIGA, releasing an N-terminal peptide [[cite:PUB00011862]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SpoIIGA peptidase (MEROPS peptidase family A36) is assumed to be an aspartic peptidase because of the presence of an Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly motif in which the Asp is an active site residue.  The peptidase is active as a homodimer [[cite:PUB00076890]]. SpoIIGA has five transmembrane helices at the N-terminal half of the molecule; the proteolytic activity is in the C-terminal half [[cite:PUB00076893]]. Its tertiary structure is not known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02854" "sigma-E processing peptidase SpoIIGA"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018571" "Sporulation sigma-E factor processing peptidase"}, "pfam" {"PF03419" "Sporulation factor SpoIIGA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sigma-E processing peptidase SpoIIGA", "short" "SpoIIGA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 1157, "taxa" 3767, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4042, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4039, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2912}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
