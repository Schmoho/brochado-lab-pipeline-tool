{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents acetyltransferases found in pro- and eukaryotes.</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes a group of plant acetyltransferases, including NSI from Arabidopsis (also known as GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase 2), SNAT1/2 from rice and Histone acetyltransferase TAP1/2 from Glycine max (Soybean). NSI is a vascular-expressed acetyltransferase that interacts with NSP, which is a nuclear shuttle protein [[cite:PUB00097784]]. It has dual specificity triggering both N-alpha-acetylation (NTA), with a preference for alanine, serine, threonine, methionine and to a lower extent valine as substrates (can also use glycine and leucine), and epsilon-lysine acetylation (KA) of several plastid proteins [[cite:PUB00103909]]. NSI is also involved in melatonin biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of N-acetylserotonin (NAS) from serotonin and of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) from 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) [[cite:PUB00103910]]. It has been shown to regulate the nuclear export of the viral genome and potentially other non transcriptional nuclear events in plant cells [[cite:PUB00097785]]. SNAT1 catalyses the N-acetylation of serotonin into N-acetylserotonin, the penultimate step in the synthesis of melatonin [[cite:PUB00097788], [cite:PUB00097787], [cite:PUB00097786], [cite:PUB00097789]]. TAP1 acts as a susceptibility factor that is hijacked by Avh52 in order to promote acetylation of histones H2A and H3 during early infection by Phytophthora sojae [[cite:PUB00097790]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes ArgA amino-acid acetyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that catalyses the conversion of L-glutamate to alpha-N-acetyl-L-glutamate [[cite:PUB00155207]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6k5m", "name" "The crystal structure of a serotonin N-acetyltransferase from Oryza Sativa (Rice)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43626" "ACYL-COA N-ACYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetyltransferase NSI-like", "short" "NSI-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2912, "taxa" 12620, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13868, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13868, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10345}, "pathways" 221}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
