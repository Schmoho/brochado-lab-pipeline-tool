Although it was originally suggested that the JmjN and JmjC domains always co-occur and might form a single functional unit within the folded protein, the JmjC domain was later found without the JmjN domain in organisms from bacteria to human [[cite:PUB00008126], [cite:PUB00007419], [cite:PUB00099121]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins containing JmjC domain are predicted to be metalloenzymes that adopt the cupin fold and are candidates for enzymes that regulate chromatin remodelling [[cite:PUB00007419]]. The cupin fold is a flattened β-barrel structure containing two sheets of five antiparallel β-strands that form the walls of a zinc-binding cleft. Based on the crystal structure of JmjC domain containing protein FIH and JHDM3A/JMJD2A, the JmjC domain forms an enzymatically active pocket that coordinates Fe(III) and alphaKG. Three amino-acid residues within the JmjC domain bind to the Fe(II) cofactor and two additional residues bind to alphaKG [[cite:PUB00070012]].</p>\n\n<p>JmjC domains were identified in numerous eukaryotic proteins containing domains typical of transcription factors, such as PHD, C2H2, ARID/BRIGHT and zinc fingers [[cite:PUB00007419], [cite:PUB00021723]]. The JmjC has been shown to function in a histone demethylation mechanism that is conserved from yeast to human [[cite:PUB00033727]]. JmjC domain proteins may be protein hydroxylases that catalyse a novel histone modification [[cite:PUB00021054]]. The human JmjC protein named Tyw5p unexpectedly acts in the biosynthesis of a hypermodified nucleoside, hydroxy-wybutosine, in tRNA-Phe by catalysing hydroxylation [[cite:PUB00057442]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7zcc", "name" "yxBC from Bacillus subtilis in complex with Mn and N-oxalylglycine (NOG)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13096" "MINA53 MYC INDUCED NUCLEAR ANTIGEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone lysine demethylase/ribosomal histidine hydroxylase NO66-like", "short" "NO66-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3663, "taxa" 15507, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15719, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15719, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11521}, "pathways" 45}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
