{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amylase binding streptococci only colonise hosts that produce amylase in their saliva. In Streptococcus gordonii, amylase binding is mediated by amylase-binding protein A (AbpA). This protein folds into an elongated structure that consists of two domains: an N-terminal helical domain and a small C-terminal α/β domain consisting of a three-stranded β-sheet packed with α-helix [[cite:PUB00105813]]. The helical domain has been shown to be responsible for the amylase binding, while the C-terminal domain interacts with SrtB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040523" "amylase-binding adhesin AbpA"}, "pfam" {"PF22224" "Amylase-binding protein AbpA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amylase-binding protein AbpA", "short" "AbpA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 60, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62, "sets" 0, "proteins" 62, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053991", :literature {"PUB00105813" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sethi A" "Mohanty B" "Ramasubbu N" "Gooley PR."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Structure of amylase-binding protein A of Streptococcus gordonii: a potential receptor for human salivary α-amylase enzyme.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1013-8", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25739638}, "PUB00105815" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Rogers JD" "Haase EM" "Brown AE" "Douglas CWI" "Gwynn JP" "Scannapieco FA."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Identification and analysis of a gene (abpA) encoding a major amylase-binding protein in Streptococcus gordonii.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "1223-1233", "volume" "144 ( Pt 5)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9611797}, "PUB00105814" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Liang X" "Liu B" "Zhu F" "Scannapieco FA" "Haase EM" "Matthews S" "Wu H."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "A distinct sortase SrtB anchors and processes a streptococcal adhesin AbpA with a novel structural property.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "30966", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27492581}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053991", "name" "Amylase-binding protein AbpA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 1}}}
