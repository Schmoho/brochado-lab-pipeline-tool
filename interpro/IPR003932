{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The epithelial membrane proteins (EMP-1, -2 and -3), peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), and lens fibre membrane intrinsic protein (LMIP) comprise a protein family on the basis of sequence and structural similarities [[cite:PUB00002934]]. Each family member is a small hydrophobic membrane glycoprotein, ~160-170 amino acids in length, and shares a common predicted transmembrane (TM) topology of 4 TM domains, with intracellular N- and C-termini [[cite:PUB00008831]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMP-1, previously termed tumour-associated membrane protein (TMP), was originally isolated from a mouse brain tumour [[cite:PUB00001869]]. Human, rat and rabbit isoforms have also been identified. EMP-1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including heart, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney and small intestine [[cite:PUB00008833]]. A role for the protein in the control of cell growth has been suggested [[cite:PUB00002934]]. EMP-1 is expressed at high levels in proliferating cells, and at reduced levels in cells undergoing growth arrest [[cite:PUB00001869]]. In contrast, PMP22, which is co-expressed with EMP-1 in a range of tissues, displays an inverse pattern of regulation, with high levels of expression in cultured cells undergoing growth arrest [[cite:PUB00001869]]. It has therefore been proposed that these proteins may have reciprocal functions in the control of cell quiescence and proliferation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01454" "EPMEMPROT1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Epithelial membrane protein EMP-1", "short" "EMP_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 147, "taxa" 518, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 543, "sets" 0, "proteins" 193, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 138}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003932", :literature {"PUB00002934" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Taylor V" "Welcher AA" "Program AE" "Suter U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
