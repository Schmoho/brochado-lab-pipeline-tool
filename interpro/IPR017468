{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sequences in this family of proteins are members of the chain length determinant family ([interpro:IPR003856]) which includes the wzc protein from Escherichia coli. This family of proteins are homologous to the EpsF protein of the methanolan biosynthesis operon of Methylobacillus sp. 12S [[cite:PUB00021014]]. The distribution of this protein appears to be restricted to a subset of exopolysaccharide operons containing a syntenic grouping of genes including a variant of the EpsH exosortase protein. Exosortase has been proposed to be involved in the targeting and processing of proteins containing the PEP-CTERM domain to the exopolysaccharide layer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03017" "chain length determinant protein EpsF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chain length determinant protein EpsF", "short" "Chain_len_reg_EpsF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 200, "taxa" 729, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 663, "sets" 0, "proteins" 663, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 536}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0655", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0655"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017468", :literature {"PUB00021014" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 2", "authors" ["Yoshida T" "Ayabe Y" "Yasunaga M" "Usami Y" "Habe H" "Nojiri H" "Omori T."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.25913-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Genes involved in the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide methanolan by the obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus sp strain 12S.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "431-44", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12624205}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017468", "name" "Chain length determinant protein EpsF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
