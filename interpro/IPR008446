{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Protein G2 from Vaccinia virus, also known as Late transcription elongation factor OPG087, and similar sequences from poxvirus. G2 is involved in postreplicative transcription elongation on intermediate and late genes [[cite:PUB00103642]]. Most members of this family are Chordopoxvirus isatin-beta-thiosemicarbazone dependent protein (protein G2) sequences.
