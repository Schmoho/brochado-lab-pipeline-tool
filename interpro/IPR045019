{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes beta-carotene hydroxylases ([ec:1.14.15.24]) and related proteins from bacteria and plants. Beta-carotene hydroxylases are nonheme diiron monooxygenases involved in the biosynthesis of xanthophylls that specifically hydroxylates the β-ring of beta-carotene, using ferredoxin as an electron donor. Plant members have also a low activity toward the β- and ε-rings of alpha-carotene and no activity towards acyclic carotenoids such as lycopene and neurosporene [[cite:PUB00097723]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31899" "BETA-CAROTENE 3-HYDROXYLASE 1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-carotene hydroxylase-like", "short" "BETA-OHASE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1439, "taxa" 5258, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5572, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5572, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4162}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
