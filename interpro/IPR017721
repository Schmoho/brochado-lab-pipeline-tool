{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the alpha subunit of indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (IOR; [ec:1.2.7.8]), an α(2)/β(2) tetramer whose cofactors include TPP, 4Fe4S, and 3Fe-4S. This enzyme is related to several other ketoacid oxidoreductases, including the ketoacid oxidoreductases for pyruvate ([ec:1.2.7.1], POR), 2-ketoglutarate ([ec:1.2.7.3], KOR), and 2-oxoisovalerate ([ec:1.2.7.7], VOR). These multi-subunit enzymes typically are found in anaerobes, such as Pyrococcus furiosus and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and are inactivated by oxygen.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03336" "indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunit alpha"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006439" "Indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Indolepyruvate oxidoreductase subunit IorA", "short" "IorA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1151, "taxa" 6183, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6524}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
