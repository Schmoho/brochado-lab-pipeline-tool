{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Branched-chain aminotransferase catalyses the transamination of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine to their respective alpha-keto acids, alpha-ketoisocaproate, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate and alpha-ketoisovalerate. The enzyme requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor to catalyze the reaction. It has been found that mammals have two forms of the enzyme - mitochondrial and cytosolic forms while bacteria contain only one form of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00081811]]. The mitochondrial form plays a significant role in skeletal muscle glutamine and alanine synthesis and in interorgan nitrogen metabolism [[cite:PUB00081812]]. Members of this entry are widely distributed in all three forms of life.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1iye", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ESCHELICHIA COLI BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043132", "name" "Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase-like, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036038", "name" "Aminotransferase-like, PLP-dependent enzymes", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01557" "BCAT_beta_family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Branched-chain aminotransferase", "short" "BCAT_family"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 71, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9732, "taxa" 36952, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43222, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43209, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31887}, "pathways" 67}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
