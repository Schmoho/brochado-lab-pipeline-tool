{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductases, including KDSR from animals and Tsc10 from yeasts and plants. They catalyse the reduction of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS) to dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and are required for sphingolipid biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00097729], [cite:PUB00097730], [cite:PUB00097728]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry show strong conservation of the active site tetrad and glycine rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDRs. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (α/β folding pattern with a central β-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyse a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing  [[cite:PUB00000419], [cite:PUB00081093], [cite:PUB00027779]].</p>\n\n<p>Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction [[cite:PUB00081093], [cite:PUB00027779], [cite:PUB00093241]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3guy", "name" "Crystal structure of a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase from Vibrio parahaemolyticus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08939" "3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR) and related proteins, classical (c) SDR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase KDSR-like", "short" "KDSR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2430, "taxa" 8940, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5018, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5017, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3273}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
