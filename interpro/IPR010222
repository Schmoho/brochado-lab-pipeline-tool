{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents HrpA, one of two related but uncharacterised DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicases in many Proteobacteria and a few high-GC Gram-positive bacteria. HrpA is about 1300 amino acids long, while its paralog HrpB, also uncharacterised, is about 800 amino acids long. Related characterised eukarotic proteins are RNA helicases associated with pre-mRNA processing. The HrpA/B homologue from Borrelia is 500 amino acids shorter but appears to be derived from HrpA rather than HrpB [[cite:PUB00074061], [cite:PUB00074062]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01967" "ATP-dependent RNA helicase HrpA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA helicase HrpA", "short" "RNA_helicase_HrpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3534, "taxa" 13168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14497, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1895}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
