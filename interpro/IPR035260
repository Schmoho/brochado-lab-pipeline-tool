It contributes to spindle stability. The C-terminal half of Fin1 contains coiled-coil motifs that are required for its self-association. The N-terminal half of Fin1 can be phosphorylated at multiple sites by the cyclin-dependent kinase Clb5-Cdk1, and dephosphorylation in anaphase triggers its localization to the spindle [[cite:PUB00085282]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17300" "Filaments in between nuclei protein-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Filaments in between nuclei protein-1", "short" "Fin1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 24, "taxa" 103, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 60, "sets" 0, "proteins" 55, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035260", :literature {"PUB00085276" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["van Hemert MJ" "Lamers GE" "Klein DC" "Oosterkamp TH" "Steensma HY" "van Heusden GP."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
