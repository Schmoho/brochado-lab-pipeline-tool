{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains viral proteins that are involved in virion envelopment and egress. It includes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BBLF1 protein (also known as cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3 and Herpesvirus UL11 homologue), which is present in the tegument layer of EBV and is involved in virion maturation. BBLF1 also participates in viral entry at the fusion step probably by regulating the core fusion machinery.  BBLF1 has been shown to localize to the trans-Golgi network along with gp350/220, a site where final envelopment of EBV particles takes place. BBLF1 shares 13 to 15% amino acid sequence identity with the herpes simplex virus 1 UL11 and cytomegalovirus UL99 tegument proteins, and like these it is a myristoylated and palmitoylated protein [[cite:PUB00082568]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04042" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3"}, "pfam" {"PF10813" "Herpesvirus UL11 homologue"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3, herpesvirus", "short" "Herpesvirus_CEP3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 60, "sets" 0, "proteins" 60, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024360", :literature {"PUB00082568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Chiu YF" "Sugden B" "Chang PJ" "Chen LW" "Lin YJ" "Lan YC" "Lai CH" "Liou JY" "Liu ST" "Hung CH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
