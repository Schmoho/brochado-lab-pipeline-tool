{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of bacterial C-S lyases from a family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, including PatB of Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00064940]] and MalY fom Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00150962]]. Other members of this family are: the virulence factor [swissprot:Q56257] from Treponema denticola, whose hemolysin activity may stem from H2S production [[cite:PUB00021288]]; and PatB from Staphylococcus hominis, a C-S lyase that is active on aliphatic cysteine-S-conjugates and that releases thioalcohol 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol  from the odourless precursor Cys-Gly-3M3SH secreted from human skin, which is a major contributor to body odour [[cite:PUB00106831]]. Some member of this group occur next to examples of the enzyme 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase, from ovothiol A biosynthesis, and would be expected to perform a C-S cleavage of 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide to leave 1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine (ovothiol A) [[cite:PUB00064920]]. Others are (mis)annotated as probable aminotransferases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9kau", "name" "Three-dimensional structure of homo-dimer of cystathione beta lyase/PLP/+L-alliin complex from Bacillus cereus(BcPatB)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04350" "PatB family C-S lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-S lyase, PatB-like", "short" "C-S_lyase_PatB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2843, "taxa" 12057, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15951, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15951, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12238}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
