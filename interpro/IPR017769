{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The two phosphocholine-preferring phospholipase C enzymes ([interpro:IPR017767]) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, include the hemolytic protein PlcH, which can hydrolyse sphingomyelin as well as phosphatidylcholine. This entry represents PlcR, an accessory protein for PlcH with which it forms a heterodimer. PlcR is required for the secretion of PlcH and affects both its enzymatic and hemolytic activities [[cite:PUB00043442], [cite:PUB00043104]]. The P. aeruginosa protein, is encoded immediately downstream of PlcH, but the equivalent proteins from various Burkholderia species are not.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03398" "phospholipase C accessory protein PlcR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phospholipase C accessory protein PlcR", "short" "PLipase_C_acessory_PlcR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 94, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 98}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017769", :literature {"PUB00043442" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Cota-Gomez A" "Vasil AI" "Kadurugamuwa J" "Beveridge TJ" "Schweizer HP" "Vasil ML."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
