{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is an essential protein that is highly conserved in metazoan evolution, and which may act as a DNA-bridging protein [[cite:PUB00015062]]. BAF binds directly to double-stranded DNA, to transcription activators, and to inner nuclear membrane proteins, including lamin A filament proteins that anchor nuclear-pore complexes in place, and nuclear LEM-domain proteins that bind to laminins filaments and chromatin. New findings suggest that BAF has structural roles in nuclear assembly and chromatin organisation, represses gene expression and might interlink chromatin structure, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in metazoans [[cite:PUB00015060]].</p>\r\n<p>BAF can be exploited by retroviruses to act as a host component of pre-integration complexes, which promote the integration of the retroviral DNA into the host chromosome by preventing autointegration of retroviral DNA [[cite:PUB00015061]]. BAF might contribute to the assembly or activity of retroviral pre-integration complexes through direct binding to the retroviral proteins p55 Gag and matrix, as well as to DNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6usd", "name" "Barrier-to-autointegration factor soaked in ethanol: 1 of 14 in MSCS set"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036617", "name" "Barrier-to-autointegration factor, BAF superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01023" "Barrier to autointegration factor"}, "pfam" {"PF02961" "Barrier to autointegration factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Barrier- to-autointegration factor, BAF", "short" "BAF_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 41, "proteomes" 725, "taxa" 3270, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2144, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2120, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1429}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004122", :literature {"PUB00015060" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Segura-Totten M" "Wilson KL."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Cell Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2004.03.004", "medline_journal" "Trends Cell Biol", "title" "BAF: roles in chromatin, nuclear structure and retrovirus integration.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "261-6", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15130582}, "PUB00015061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Mansharamani M" "Graham DR" "Monie D" "Lee KK" "Hildreth JE" "Siliciano RF" "Wilson KL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
