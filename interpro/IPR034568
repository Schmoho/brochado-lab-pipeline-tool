{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The large protein complex Mediator is a central coregulator of transcription in eukaryotes. It acts as a bridge to pass on the information from the transcription factors to the basal transcriptional unit at the core promoter, resulting in either transcriptional activation or repression. The plant Mediator subunits typically show very low homology to other species, plant Meds being closer to human than to yeast counterparts. The plant Mediator appears to be composed of one or more members of 34 subunits, as opposed to 25 and 30 members in yeast and metazoans, respectively [[cite:PUB00078644]]. This entry represents subunit 30 of the plant complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36406" "MEDIATOR OF RNA POLYMERASE II TRANSCRIPTION SUBUNIT 30"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 30", "short" "MED30"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 908, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 539, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 306}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034568", :literature {"PUB00078644" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Mathur S" "Vyas S" "Kapoor S" "Tyagi AK."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.188300", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "The Mediator complex in plants: structure, phylogeny, and expression profiling of representative genes in a dicot (Arabidopsis) and a monocot (rice) during reproduction and abiotic stress.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1609-27", "volume" "157", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22021418}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016592", "name" "mediator complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034568", "name" "Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 30", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
