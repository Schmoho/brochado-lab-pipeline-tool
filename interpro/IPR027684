{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tubulin heterodimer consists of one alpha- and one beta-tubulin polypeptide. In humans, five tubulin-specific chaperones termed TBCA/B/C/D/E are essential for bring the alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits together into a tightly associated heterodimer. Following the generation of quasi-native beta- and alpha-tubulin polypeptides (via multiple rounds of ATP-dependent interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin), TBCA and TBCB bind to and stabilise newly synthesised beta- and alpha-tubulin, respectively. The exchange of beta-tubulin between TBCA and TBCD, and of alpha-tubulin between TBCB and TBCE, resulting in the formation of TBCD/beta and TBCE/alpha. These two complexes then interact with each other and form a supercomplex (TBCE/alpha/TBCD/beta). Interaction of the supercomplex with TBCC causes the disassembly of the supercomplex and the release of E-site GDP-bound alpha/beta tubulin heterodimer, which becomes polymerization competent following spontaneous exchange with GTP [[cite:PUB00077898]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents tubulin-specific chaperone C (TBCC, also known as tubulin-folding cofactor C), which is involved in the final step of the tubulin folding pathway [[cite:PUB00052406], [cite:PUB00066362]].
