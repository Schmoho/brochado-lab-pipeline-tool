{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a diverse group of multifunctional proteins that regulate cellular signalling events downstream of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). They belong to the R7 (Neuronal RGS) subfamily, which includes RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11, all of which, in humans, are expressed predominantly in the nervous system [[cite:PUB00087931], [cite:PUB00060536]]. They form an obligatory complex with G-beta-5, and play important roles in the regulation of crucial neuronal processes [[cite:PUB00048649]]. In addition, R7 proteins were found to bind many other proteins outside of the G protein signalling pathways including: m-opioid receptor, beta-arrestin, alpha-actinin-2, NMDAR, polycystin, spinophilin, guanylyl cyclase, among others. They have an RGS domain, which is an essential part of the R7 protein subfamily. These proteins are involved in many crucial cellular processes such as regulation of intracellular trafficking, glial differentiation, embryonic axis formation, skeletal and muscle development, and cell migration during early embryogenesis [[cite:PUB00087788]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Egl-10, an orthologue of human RGS7 from C. elegans.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fqi", "name" "RGS9 RGS DOMAIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR047017", "name" "Regulator of G-protein signalling 6/7/9/11, DHEX domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45746" "LP21163P"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Regulator of G protein signaling 6/7/9/11", "short" "RGS6/7/9/11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1042, "taxa" 4158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5527}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047016", :literature {"PUB00087931" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Anderson GR" "Posokhova E" "Martemyanov KA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Biochem.
