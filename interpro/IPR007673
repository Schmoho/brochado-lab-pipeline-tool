{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes condensin subunit 1 (CND1). CND1 is a regulatory subunit of the condensin complex (contains the SMC2 and SMC4 heterodimer, and three non SMC subunits that probably regulate the complex: NCAPH/BRRN1, NCAPD2/CAPD2 and NCAPG), a complex required for conversion of interphase chromatin into mitotic-like condense chromosomes [[cite:PUB00007177]]. The condensin complex probably introduces positive supercoils into relaxed DNA in the presence of type I topoisomerases and converts nicked DNA into positive knotted forms in the presence of type II topoisomerases [[cite:PUB00062096], [cite:PUB00010072], [cite:PUB00062097], [cite:PUB00100765]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Condensin is a multi-subunit protein complex that acts as an essential regulator of chromosome condensation [[cite:PUB00056005], [cite:PUB00100765]]. It contains both SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) and non-SMC subunits. Condensin plays an important role during mitosis in the compaction and resolution of chromosomes to remove and prevent catenations that would otherwise inhibit segregation. This is thought to be achieved by the introduction of positive supercoils into relaxed DNA in the presence of type I topoisomerases and converts nicked DNA into positive knotted forms in the presence of type II topoisomerases. During interphase condensin promotes clustering of dispersed loci into subnuclear domains and inhibits associations between homologues. In meiosis, condensin has been shown to influence the number of crossover events by regulating programmed double-strand breaks. Roles in gene regulation and lymphocyte development have also been defined.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017127" "Chromosome condensation complex condensin, subunit D2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Condensin subunit 1", "short" "Condensin_cplx_su1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2076, "taxa" 7055, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4855, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3566, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1071}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007673", :literature {"PUB00056005" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wood AJ" "Severson AF" "Meyer BJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
