{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a heterotrimeric eukaryotic kinase that interacts with diverse proteins and regulates their activity in response to starvation and stress signals. This entry represents a group of plant FCS-Like Zinc finger proteins, including FLZ8 and MARD1 from Arabidopsis. They may act as an adapter to facilitate the interaction of SnRK1 complex with effector proteins, conferring tissue- and stimulus-type specific differences in the SnRK1 regulation pathway [[cite:PUB00095460], [cite:PUB00096499]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46443" "FCS-LIKE ZINC FINGER 8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FCS-Like Zinc finger 8/MARD1", "short" "FLZ8/MARD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 231, "taxa" 865, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1461, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1461, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 890}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044593", :literature {"PUB00095460" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Nietzsche M" "Schie√ül I" "Bornke F."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "The complex becomes more complex: protein-protein interactions of SnRK1 with DUF581 family proteins provide a framework for cell- and stimulus type-specific SnRK1 signaling in plants.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "54", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24600465}, "PUB00096499" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Jamsheer K M" "Shukla BN" "Jindal S" "Gopan N" "Mannully CT" "Laxmi A."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The FCS-like zinc finger scaffold of the kinase SnRK1 is formed by the coordinated actions of the FLZ domain and intrinsically disordered regions.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "13134-13150", "volume" "293", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29945970}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044593", "name" "FCS-Like Zinc finger 8/MARD1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
