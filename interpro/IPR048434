{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes DraIII from Deinococcus radiophilus, a type IIP restriction endonuclease that recognises a gapped double-stranded DNA sequence and nicks creating a double strand break with a three base 3' overhang. DraIII adopts a homodimeric configuration. Each monomer shows a ββα-metal fold in the C terminus, where the HNH active site is located. It also has two zinc and one magnesium-binding sites [[cite:PUB00151848]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21586" "DraIII"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DraIII-like", "short" "DraIII-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 95, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048434", :literature {"PUB00151848" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zhuo W" "Lai X" "Zhang L" "Chan SH" "Li F" "Zhu Z" "Yang M" "Sun D."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Cell", "title" "Elimination of inter-domain interactions increases the cleavage fidelity of the restriction endonuclease DraIII.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "357-68", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24733184}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048434", "name" "DraIII-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 5}}}
