{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Myticin is a cysteine-rich peptide produced in three isoforms, A, B and C, by Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel). Isoforms A and B show antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, while isoform B is additionally active against the fungus Fusarium oxysporum and a Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli (streptomycin resistant strain D31) [[cite:PUB00044389]]. Myticin-prepro is the precursor peptide. The mature molecule, named myticin, consists of 40 residues, with four intramolecular disulphide bridges and a cysteine array in the primary structure different from that of previously characterised cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides. The first 20 amino acids are a putative signal peptide, and the antimicrobial peptide sequence is a 36-residue C-terminal extension. Such a structure suggests that myticins are synthesised as prepro-proteins that are then processed by various proteolytic events before storage in the haemocytes as the active peptide. Myticin precursors are expressed mainly in the haemocytes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10690" "Myticin pre-proprotein from the mussel"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myticin preproprotein", "short" "Myticin_preproprotein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 30, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 230, "sets" 0, "proteins" 228, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 225}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019631", :literature {"PUB00044389" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Mitta G" "Hubert F" "Noel T" "Roch P."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
