{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is represented by the multipass membrane protein XK, which may be involved in sodium-dependent transport of neutral amino acids or oligopeptides. It forms a heterodimer with Kell. In humans, Kell is an 93kDa type II membrane glycoprotein with endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity that is linked by a single disulphide bond to XK, that spans the membrane ten times. An absence of XK leads to clinical symptoms termed the McLeod syndrome [OMIM:314850], an X-linked multi-system disorder characterised by late onset abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems [[cite:PUB00044544], [cite:PUB00044545]]. It has been shown that XK recruits the lipid transfer protein VPS13A from lipid droplets to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and dysregulation of a VPS13A-XK complex is the common basis for Chorea-Acanthocytosis and McLeod Syndrome [[cite:PUB00100790]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09815" "XK-related protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "XK-related protein", "short" "XK-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 146, "proteomes" 1026, "taxa" 4157, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10750, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10151, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6490}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018629", :literature {"PUB00081187" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Suzuki J" "Imanishi E" "Nagata S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
