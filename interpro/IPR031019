{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are probable protein/peptide-modifying radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins. The majority of members of this family seem to target Cys-rich repetitive regions of large proteins rather than of bacteriocin-sized small precursors. This arrangement suggests the modification target may be multifunctional, with the C-terminal domain behaving like a bacteriocin but other parts of the same precursor serving an immunity function, as occurs for the halocin C8 precursor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04463" "TIGR04463 family radical SAM/SPASM RiPP maturase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radical SAM/SPASM domain protein maturase", "short" "rSAM_vs_C_rich"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 97, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031019", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031019", "name" "Radical SAM/SPASM domain protein maturase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
