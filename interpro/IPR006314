{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Heme peroxidases were originally divided into two superfamilies, namely, the animal peroxidases and the plant peroxidases (class I, II and III), which include fungal (class II) and bacterial peroxidases. The DyP (for dye decolorizing peroxidase) family constitutes a novel class of heme peroxidase. Because these enzymes were derived from fungal sources, the DyP family was thought to be structurally related to the class II secretory fungal peroxidases. However, the DyP family exhibits only low sequence similarity to classical fungal peroxidases, such as LiP and MnP, and does not contain the conserved proximal and distal histidines and an essential arginine found in other plant peroxidase superfamily members.</p>\n\n<p>DyP proteins have several characteristics that distinguish them from all other peroxidases, including a particularly wide substrate specificity, a lack of homology to most other peroxidases, and the ability to function well under much lower pH conditions compared with the other plant peroxidases [[cite:PUB00047552]]. In terms of substrate specificity, DyP degrades the typical peroxidase substrates, but also degrades hydroxyl-free anthraquinone (many dyes are derived from anthraquinone compounds).</p>\n\n<p>Crystal structures of DyP family members reveal two domains, each one adopting a ferredoxin-like fold [[cite:PUB00047708], [cite:PUB00099956], [cite:PUB00061072]]. The proteins consist of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain likely to be related by a duplication of an ancestral gene, as inferred from the conserved topology of the domains. The heme iron is penta-coordinated, with the protein contributing a conserved histidine ligand to the iron centre. A conserved Asp most likely acts as a proton donor/acceptor and takes the place of the catalytic histidine used by plant peroxidases. This Asp substitution helps explain why the DyP family is active at low pH [[cite:PUB00052610], [cite:PUB00100762]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8pws", "name" "Dye-decolourising peroxidase DtpB (56 kGy)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30521" "DEFERROCHELATASE/PEROXIDASE"}, "profile" {"PS51404" "DyP-type peroxidase family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01413" "Dyp-type peroxidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dyp-type peroxidase", "short" "Dyp_peroxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 125, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3976, "taxa" 15541, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23940, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23936, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17528}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0810", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0810"} {"accession" "GenProp1470", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1470"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
