{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp, also known as murein lipoprotein), which controls the distance between the inner and outer membranes [[cite:PUB00094446], [cite:PUB00094443]]. This abundant protein contains lipids in its N-terminal which anchor it to the outer membrane. This is the only protein known to bind covalently to the peptidoglycan network (PGN) but it also binds it through non-covalent interactions. About one-third of the Lpp is bound to the cell wall and the rest is free in the periplasm. Lpp have a structural function mediating the interactions between the outer membrane and PGN to assure the correct distance between them and contributes to the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane [[cite:PUB00094443]]. The role of the periplasm free Lpp remains unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2guv", "name" "Conformational Transition between Four- and Five-stranded Phenylalanine Zippers Determined by a Local Packing Interaction"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00843" "Major outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp [lpp]"}, "panther" {"PTHR38763" "MAJOR OUTER MEMBRANE PROLIPOPROTEIN LPP"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002855" "Murein-lipoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp", "short" "MOM_Lpp"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 288, "taxa" 1933, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2389, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2388, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1966}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016367", :literature {"PUB00094443" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Boags AT" "Samsudin F" "Khalid S."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Binding from Both Sides: TolR and Full-Length OmpA Bind and Maintain the Local Structure of the E.Â coli Cell Wall.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "713-724.e2", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30713026}, "PUB00094446" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Asmar AT" "Ferreira JL" "Cohen EJ" "Cho SH" "Beeby M" "Hughes KT" "Collet JF."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Communication across the bacterial cell envelope depends on the size of the periplasm.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "e2004303", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29257832}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016367", "name" "Major outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
