{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of atypical dual-specificity phosphatases are predominantly from fungi, plants and bacteria. This entry includes budding yeast Siw14 (also known as Oca3) and related proteins. Siw14 is a inositol pyrophosphate phosphatase that modulates inositol pyrophosphate metabolism by dephosphorylating the IP7 isoform 5PP-IP5to IP6 [[cite:PUB00088170]]. This entry also includes budding yeast Oca1/2/4/6 and Arabidopsis DSP1/2/3/4/5. All DSPs tested (AtPFA-DSP1, -2, -3, and -5) displayed phosphatase activity toward PI(3,5)P2, with AtPFA-DSP2 showing a higher activity [[cite:PUB00088172]]. Oca1/2/4/6 are putative phosphatases associated with the caffeine-sensitivity stress pathway in S. cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00088172]]. It also includes dual specificity protein phosphatase TpbA that regulates diverse phenotypes in P.aeruginosa via regulation of the concentration of cellular c-di-GMP [[cite:PUB00078743]]. This phosphatase acts by dephosphorylating the membrane-anchored diguanylate cyclase TpbB at tyrosine and serine/threonine sites, leading to inactivation of TpbB and reduced c-di-GMP production [[cite:PUB00078743], [cite:PUB00151104]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7mod", "name" "Crystal Structure of Arabidopsis thaliana Plant and Fungi Atypical Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1(AtPFA-DSP1 ) Cys150Ser in Complex with Phosphate in Conformation A (Pi(A))"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029021", "name" "Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03162" "Tyrosine phosphatase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Atypical dual-specificity phosphatase Siw14-like", "short" "Siw14-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 87, "proteomes" 1384, "taxa" 5067, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6950, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6748, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4491}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
