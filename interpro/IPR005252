{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a bifunctional enzyme CoaBC (gene name dfp) that catalyses the second and third steps (cysteine ligation, ([ec:6.3.2.5]), and decarboxylation, ([ec:4.1.1.36])) in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) from pantothenate in bacteria. This enzyme contains the FMN cofactor, but no FAD or pyruvoyl group. The amino-terminal region is responsible for the phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity [[cite:PUB00015483]].</p>\n\n<p>The protein product of the dfp gene in Escherichia coli was found to be able to restore a temperature-sensitive conditionally lethal mutation that resulted in a slow cessation of DNA synthesis [[cite:PUB00060434]]. The protein encoded by dfp was then found to affect both DNA and pantothenate metabolism [[cite:PUB00015610]]. Later, phosphopantothenate-cysteine ligase activity, which is involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, was demonstrated in the same protein. Therefore this protein has been named bifunctional protein CoaBC [[cite:PUB00015483]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035929", "name" "CoaB-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02225" "Coenzyme A biosynthesis bifunctional protein CoaBC [coaBC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00521" "bifunctional phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase/phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase CoaBC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coenzyme A biosynthesis bifunctional protein CoaBC", "short" "CoaBC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8505, "taxa" 32739, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37385, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28762}, "pathways" 45}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0171", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0171"} {"accession" "GenProp1601", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1601"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
