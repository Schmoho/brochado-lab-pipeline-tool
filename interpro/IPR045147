{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of transcription factors, including ARID3A/B/C from humans and protein dead ringer (Retn) from Drosophila melanogaster. ARID3A (also known as E2FBP1 or Bright) is involved in the control of cell cycle progression by the RB1/E2F1 pathway and in B-cell differentiation [[cite:PUB00098129], [cite:PUB00098130]]. ARID3B has been linked to malignant neuroblastoma [[cite:PUB00098131]]. Retn is regulator of the late development of longitudinal glia [[cite:PUB00098132]]. Mutations in the Drosophila retn gene lead to female behavioral defects and alter a limited set of neurons in the CNS. Retn also affects a male behavioral pathway activated by fruM [[cite:PUB00098133]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15348" "AT-RICH INTERACTIVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN ARID DOMAIN- CONTAINING PROTEIN DEAD RINGER PROTEIN B-CELL REGULATOR OF IGH TRANSCRIPTION BRIGHT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 3", "short" "ARI3A/B/C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1307, "taxa" 5192, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5349, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5349, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3355}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045147", :literature {"PUB00098132" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Shandala T" "Takizawa K" "Saint R."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "The dead ringer/retained transcriptional regulatory gene is required for positioning of the longitudinal glia in the Drosophila embryonic CNS.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1505-13", "volume" "130", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12620977}, "PUB00098133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ditch LM" "Shirangi T" "Pitman JL" "Latham KL" "Finley KD" "Edeen PT" "Taylor BJ" "McKeown M."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Drosophila retained/dead ringer is necessary for neuronal pathfinding, female receptivity and repression of fruitless independent male courtship behaviors.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "155-64", "volume" "132", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15576402}, "PUB00098131" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Kobayashi K" "Era T" "Takebe A" "Jakt LM" "Nishikawa S."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "ARID3B induces malignant transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and is strongly associated with malignant neuroblastoma.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "8331-6", "volume" "66", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16951138}, "PUB00098130" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ma K" "Araki K" "Ichwan SJ" "Suganuma T" "Tamamori-Adachi M" "Ikeda MA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cancer Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cancer Res", "title" "E2FBP1/DRIL1, an AT-rich interaction domain-family transcription factor, is regulated by p53.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "438-44", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12692263}, "PUB00098129" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Peeper DS" "Shvarts A" "Brummelkamp T" "Douma S" "Koh EY" "Daley GQ" "Bernards R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "title" "A functional screen identifies hDRIL1 as an oncogene that rescues RAS-induced senescence.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "148-53", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11812999}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006357", "name" "regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045147", "name" "AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
