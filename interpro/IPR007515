{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MSS4 (mammalian suppressor of Sec4) is an evolutionarily highly conserved protein, which is expressed in all mammalian tissues. Although it was first proposed to function as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, it was soon described as a quite inefficient GEF and was thus suggested to function rather as a chaperone, protecting nucleotide free Rabs from degradation, than as a GEF [[cite:PUB00084256]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure of MSS4 revealed a mostly β fold stabilized by a Zn(2+) ion coordinated by cysteine residues from two CxxC motifs. The fold of the MSS4 domain consists of a central β sheet (betaG-betaK) flanked by a β hairpin (betaB-betaC) on one side and a small variable sheet on the other. A single Zn(2+) ion, coordinated by the thiol groups of cysteine residues from two CxxC motifs located in the betaB-betaC and betaI-betaJ loops, appears to play an important structural role by reinforcing the hydrophobic core formed by the betaB-betaC hairpin, the betaG-betaH loop, and the central β sheet [[cite:PUB00019890], [cite:PUB00014250], [cite:PUB00040811]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1hxr", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF MSS4 AT 1.65 ANGSTROMS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011057", "name" "Mss4-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011323", "name" "Mss4/translationally controlled tumour-associated TCTP", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00246" "RabGEF"}, "profile" {"PS51796" "MSS4 domain profile"}, "panther" {"PTHR13276" "GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR MSS4"}, "pfam" {"PF04421" "Mss4 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mss4", "short" "Mss4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 46, "proteomes" 1226, "taxa" 4797, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1918, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1918, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1234}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007515", :literature {"PUB00040811" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Itzen A" "Pylypenko O" "Goody RS" "Alexandrov K" "Rak A."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601044", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Nucleotide exchange via local protein unfolding--structure of Rab8 in complex with MSS4.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1445-55", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16541104}, "PUB00014250" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Zhu Z" "Dumas JJ" "Lietzke SE" "Lambright DG."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi002680o", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "A helical turn motif in Mss4 is a critical determinant of Rab binding and nucleotide release.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "3027-36", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11258916}, "PUB00084256" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Walter BM" "Nordhoff C" "Varga G" "Goncharenko G" "Schneider SW" "Ludwig S" "Wixler V."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Dis", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2012.37", "medline_journal" "Cell Death Dis", "title" "Mss4 protein is a regulator of stress response and apoptosis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e297", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22495352}, "PUB00019890" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6543", "authors" ["Yu H" "Schreiber SL."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/376788a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor human Mss4 and identification of its Rab-interacting surface.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "788-91", "volume" "376", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7651540}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005085", "name" "guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007264", "name" "small GTPase-mediated signal transduction", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007515", "name" "Mss4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 21, "alignment:full" 1141}}}
