{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the large ribosomal subunit protein mL64, also known as Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible proteins-interacting protein 1. Members of this family of proteins act as negative regulators of G1 to S cell cycle phase progression by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. Inhibitory effects are additive with GADD45 proteins but occur also in the absence of GADD45 proteins. Furthermore, they act as a repressor of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 by inhibiting AB domain-mediated transcriptional activity [[cite:PUB00044211]]. They may be involved in the hormone-mediated regulation of NR4A1 transcriptional activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043035", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein mL64 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31761" "GROWTH ARREST AND DNA DAMAGE-INDUCIBLE PROTEINS-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 GADD45GIP1"}, "pfam" {"PF10147" "Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible proteins-interacting protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein mL64", "short" "Ribosomal_mL64"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 80, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 652, "taxa" 2982, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1075, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1071, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 707}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018472", :literature {"PUB00044211" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Chung HK" "Yi YW" "Jung NC" "Kim D" "Suh JM" "Kim H" "Park KC" "Song JH" "Kim DW" "Hwang ES" "Yoon SH" "Bae YS" "Kim JM" "Bae I" "Shong M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
