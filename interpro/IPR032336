{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CagD is a tightly conserved family of proteins found in the pathogenic strains of Helicobacter species. It is one of some 30 proteins, produced from the genomic insert termed the pathogenicity island, required for the type IV secretion system - T4SS - that delivers CagA oncoprotein toxin into the host cell. CagD is a covalent dimer in which each monomer folds as a single domain composed of five β-strands and three α-helices. CagD partially associates with the inner membrane, where it may be exposed to the periplasmic space; this may indicate that CagD is released into the supernatant during host cell infection in order then to bind to the host cell surface, or to be incorporated into the pilus structure [[cite:PUB00051162]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038229", "name" "Pathogenicity island component CagD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16567" "Pathogenicity island component CagD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pathogenicity island component CagD", "short" "CagD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 80, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 267, "sets" 0, "proteins" 267, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 245}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032336", :literature {"PUB00051162" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cendron L" "Couturier M" "Angelini A" "Barison N" "Stein M" "Zanotti G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
