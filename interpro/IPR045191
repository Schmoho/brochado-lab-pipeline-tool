{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of confirmed and predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, including RHG1A/MBR1-2 from Arabidopsis and ARK2C found in human and mouse. MBR1 and MBR2 are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that function as regulator of MED25 (a subunit of the Mediator complex) stability by targeting MED25 for degradation in a RING-H2-dependent way [[cite:PUB00098230]]. The function of RHG1A is not known. In mouse, ARK2C acts as a regulator of motor axon elongation [[cite:PUB00101484]]. It is required for efficient motor axon extension in the dorsal forelimb by enhancing the transcriptional responses of the SMAD1/SMAD5/SMAD8 effectors, which are activated downstream of BMP.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5d0i", "name" "Structure of RING finger protein 165"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22937" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE RNF165"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MBR1/2-like", "short" "MBR1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1248, "taxa" 5180, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8848, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8848, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5308}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
