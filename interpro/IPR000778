{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phagocytes form the first line of defence against invasion by micro-organisms. Engulfing of bacteria by neutrophils during phagocytosis is accompanied by a respiratory burst. Defects in phagocytosis involving the lack of a respiratory burst give rise to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) [[cite:PUB00003781]]. Proteins in this entry are calcium-dependent NADPH oxidases that generates superoxide, including NADPH oxidase 1-4 from animals (also known as Cytochrome b-245 heavy chain) and Respiratory burst oxidase homologue proteins from plants. NADPH oxidase 2 is the catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that mediates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to O2 to produce the superoxide anion [[cite:PUB00158913], [cite:PUB00158914], [cite:PUB00158915], [cite:PUB00158916]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR039261", "name" "Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR), nucleotide-binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00466" "GP91PHOX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b245, heavy chain", "short" "Cyt_b245_heavy_chain"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1794, "taxa" 6565, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40776, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6958}, "pathways" 48}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
