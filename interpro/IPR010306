{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The cleavage of the C-P bond in PRPn to form a-D-ribose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-5-phosphate (PRcP) is assumed to involve a radical mechanism and PhnJ is a protein that, belonging to the Radical SAM superfamily can perform such a reaction. This enzyme appears to function through the formation of a glycyl radical by the 5'-Ado radical, this radical is then passed onto a conserved cysteine residue. The cysteine radical then forms a covalent bond with the phosphate in the substrate. The glycyl radical is recycled, ready for another reaction to occur [[cite:PUB00079189], [cite:PUB00081921]].\r\n.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xb6", "name" "Structure of the E. coli C-P lyase core complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00379" "Phosphonate metabolism (PhnJ)"}, "pfam" {"PF06007" "Phosphonate metabolism protein PhnJ"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011468" "Carbon-phosphorus lyase, PhnJ subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate 5-phosphate C-P-lyase", "short" "PhnJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 1194, "taxa" 5468, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5005, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5003, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3970}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1165", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1165"} {"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"} {"accession" "GenProp1630", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1630"} {"accession" "GenProp1381", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1381"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
