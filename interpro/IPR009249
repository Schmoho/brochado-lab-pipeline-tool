{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several different but closely related proteins which include phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase [ec:1.3.7.5] (PcyA), 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase [ec:1.3.7.2] (PebA) and phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase [ec:1.3.7.3] (PebB). Phytobilins are linear tetrapyrrole precursors of the light-harvesting prosthetic groups of the phytochrome photoreceptors of plants and the phycobiliprotein photosynthetic antennae of cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptomonads. It is known that that phytobilins are synthesised from haem via the intermediacy of biliverdin IX alpha (BV), which is reduced subsequently by ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases with different double-bond specificities [[cite:PUB00011945]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4eoc", "name" "Crystal structure of h74q Synechocystis sp.
