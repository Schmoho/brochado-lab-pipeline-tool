{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial proteins, including GrdX. GrdX is a small protein, of unknown function, encoded in grd operons for selenocysteine-dependent glycine reductase systems [[cite:PUB00105557]]. A small number of GrdX proteins appear to be encoded with a UGA-encoded selenocysteine residue appearing close to the N terminus, at sites that do not align with Cys residues in other members of the family. This arrangement suggests that the ability to complete translation of GrdX selenoproteins may have regulatory value, in addition to its molecular function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038093" "GrdX family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GrdX-like", "short" "GrdX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 240, "taxa" 1008, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 718}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047735", :literature {"PUB00105557" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Graentzdoerffer A" "Pich A" "Andreesen JR."], "ISO_journal" "Arch Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Arch Microbiol", "title" "Molecular analysis of the grd operon coding for genes of the glycine reductase and of the thioredoxin system from Clostridium sticklandii.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "8-18", "volume" "175", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11271425}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047735", "name" "GrdX-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
