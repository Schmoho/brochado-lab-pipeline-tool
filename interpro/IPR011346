{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochromes c (cytC) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes.</p>\n\n<p>This family, found in sulphate-reducers, represents a cytochrome containing sixteen haem groups which forms part of a transmembrane protein complex that allows electron flow from the periplasmic hydrogenase to the cytoplasmic enzymes that catalyse reduction of sulphates [[cite:PUB00028007]]. HmcA ([swissprot:P24092]) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain Hildenborough is composed of three distinct regions; an N-terminal three-haem domain homologous to cytochrome c7, a four-haem cyctochrome c3-like domain, and a C-terminal nine-haem cytochrome Hcc-like domain [[cite:PUB00025401], [cite:PUB00021717]]. This last domain is composed of two cytochrome c3-like domains with an isolated haem group inserted between them. HcmA interacts specifically with cytochrome c3 [[cite:PUB00028008]], where the last haem group of HcmA and haem four of cytochrome c3 interact to provide the likely site of electron transfer between molecules [[cite:PUB00025401]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2cvc", "name" "Crystal structure of High-Molecular Weight Cytochrome c from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036280", "name" "Multiheme cytochrome superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000026" "Cytochrome cc3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "High-molecular-weight cytochrome c", "short" "Cyt_cc3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 20, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011346", :literature {"PUB00025401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Czjzek M" "ElAntak L" "Zamboni V" "Morelli X" "Dolla A" "Guerlesquin F" "Bruschi M."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(02)00909-7", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The crystal structure of the hexadeca-heme cytochrome Hmc and a structural model of its complex with cytochrome c(3).", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1677-86", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12467575}, "PUB00021717" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["Matias PM" "Coelho AV" "Valente FM" "Placido D" "LeGall J" "Xavier AV" "Pereira IA" "Carrondo MA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
