{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Doublecortin domain-containing protein 1 (DCDC1), also known as DCDC5, is a member of doublecortin (DCX) family. It is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) with stable double tandem DCX repeats of ubiquitin-like tertiary fold. DCDC1 is expressed during mitosis and is involved in coordinating late cytokinesis. DCDC1 interacts with cytoplasmic dynein and Rab8, as well as with the Rab8 nucleotide exchange factor Rabin8 [[cite:PUB00093782]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46302" "DOUBLECORTIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Doublecortin domain-containing protein 1", "short" "DCDC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 305, "taxa" 1268, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 929, "sets" 0, "proteins" 929, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 357}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043188", :literature {"PUB00093782" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 23", "authors" ["Kaplan A" "Reiner O."], "ISO_journal" "J.
