{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Iodothyronine deiodinase ([ec:1.97.1.10]) (DI) [[cite:PUB00002931]] is the vertebrate enzyme responsible for the deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T4 or 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine) into the biologically active hormone T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) and of T3 into the inactive metabolite T2 (3,3'-diiodothyronine). All known DI are proteins of about 250 residues that contain a selenocysteine at their active site. Three types of DI are known, type I is commonly found in the liver and kidney [[cite:PUB00076675]], type II is essential for providing the brain with the appropriate levels of T3 during the critical period of development, and type III (also known as thyroxine 5-deiodinase) is essential for the regulation of thyroid hormone inactivation during embryological development.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4tr3", "name" "Mouse iodothyronine deiodinase 3 catalytic core, SeMet-labeled active site mutant SeCys->Cys"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001330" "Iodothyronine deiodinase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11781" "IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00837" "Iodothyronine deiodinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Iodothyronine deiodinase", "short" "Iodothyronine_deiodinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 54, "proteomes" 842, "taxa" 3752, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4857, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2899}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
