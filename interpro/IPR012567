{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the leader peptides of ilvGEDA operon. The expression of the ilvGEDA operon of E coli K-12 is multivalently controlled by the three branched -chain amino acids. Regulation is thought to occur by attenuation of transcription in response to the changing levels of the cognate tRNAs. Transcription of this operon is usually terminated at the end of the leader (regulatory) region [[cite:PUB00016507]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08046" "IlvGEDA operon leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IlvGEDA operon leader peptide", "short" "IlvGEDA_leader"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 44, "taxa" 803, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 707, "sets" 0, "proteins" 707, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 503}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012567", :literature {"PUB00016507" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Harms E" "Hsu JH" "Subrahmanyam CS" "Umbarger HE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
