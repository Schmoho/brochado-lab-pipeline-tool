{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hesx1 is a class of homeodomain proteins that bind to DNA [[cite:PUB00093932]]. It has been shown that Hesx1 functions as a transcriptional repressor required for normal forebrain development, eyes and other structures such as the olfactory placodes and pituitary gland [[cite:PUB00093934]]. It has been described that alterations in Hesx1 produce impairment of its DNA binding properties leading to Septo-Optic Dysplasia (SOD) in humans, which exhibits optic nerve and pituitary gland hypoplasia as well as midline brain abnormalities like absence of the corpus callosum and septum pellucidum [[cite:PUB00093931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents Hesx1A, Hesx1B and ANF-1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46966" "HOMEOBOX EXPRESSED IN ES CELLS 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homeobox expressed in ES cells 1", "short" "Hesx1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 596, "taxa" 2042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 860, "sets" 0, "proteins" 860, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 625}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043402", :literature {"PUB00093932" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Dattani MT" "Martinez-Barbera JP" "Thomas PQ" "Brickman JM" "Gupta R" "Martensson IL" "Toresson H" "Fox M" "Wales JK" "Hindmarsh PC" "Krauss S" "Beddington RS" "Robinson IC."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
