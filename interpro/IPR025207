{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fission yeast has three kinetochore protein complexes. Two complexes, Sim4 and Ndc80-MIND-Spc7 (NMS), are constitutive components, whereas the third complex, DASH, is transiently associated with kinetochores only in mitosis and is required for precise chromosome segregation. The Sim4 complex functions as a loading dock for the DASH complex. Sim4 consists of a number of different proteins including Ftas 1-7 and Dad1 [[cite:PUB00044193]].</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents Fta4.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42040" "INNER KINETOCHORE SUBUNIT FTA4"}, "pfam" {"PF13093" "Kinetochore complex Fta4 of Sim4 subunit, or CENP-50"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kinetochore Sim4 complex subunit Fta4", "short" "Sim4_Fta4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 742, "taxa" 1938, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1064, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 670}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025207", :literature {"PUB00044193" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Liu X" "McLeod I" "Anderson S" "Yates JR 3rd" "He X."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600762", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Molecular analysis of kinetochore architecture in fission yeast.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2919-30", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16079914}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0031511", "name" "Mis6-Sim4 complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025207", "name" "Kinetochore Sim4 complex subunit Fta4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 58, "alignment:full" 535}}}
