{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Tail tip protein (L) from Bacteriophage lambda and similar proteins found in tailed bacteriophages (Caudovirales) and prophages mostly from Proteobacteria. L is part of the distal tail tip complex which plays a role in DNA ejection during entry, and in tail assembly initiation during exit. The tail tip complex is assembled successively with three tail tip proteins J, one tail tip protein I, one tail tip protein L and one tail tip protein K. The tail tip complex interacts with tail measure protein to initiate tail tube assembly. The formation of the tail tip complex is completed by the addition of tail tip protein M, which is followed by tail tube polymerisation [[cite:PUB00077057], [cite:PUB00075672]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01600" "phage minor tail protein L"}, "pfam" {"PF05100" "Phage minor tail protein L"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage lambda, Tail tip protein L", "short" "Phage_lambda_L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 461, "taxa" 3454, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4635, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4611, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2744}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006487", :literature {"PUB00075672" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Tam W" "Pell LG" "Bona D" "Tsai A" "Dai XX" "Edwards AM" "Hendrix RW" "Maxwell KL" "Davidson AR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
