{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Isochorismate synthase ([ec:5.4.4.2]) catalyses the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate, the first step in the biosynthesis of both the respiratory chain component menaquinone (MK, vitamin K2) and phylloquinone (vitamin K1). In bacteria, isochorismate is a precursor of siderophores enterobactin (via the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) precursor) [[cite:PUB00014431]], amonabactins [[cite:PUB00014433]] and salicylic acid [[cite:PUB00011071]]. Most aerobic bacteria secrete siderophores to facilitate iron acquisition [[cite:PUB00014408]]. Siderophores are iron-chelating agents which are low molecular weight compounds that specifically bind ferric iron and mediate iron uptake into the cell by recognition of specific membrane receptor proteins and transport systems. In plants, isochorismate synthase is required for defence against pathogens. Salicylic acid synthesised via the pathway using isochorismate synthase is responsible for both local and systemic acquired resistance in plants [[cite:PUB00014438]].</p>\n\n<p>In Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, two distinct isochorismate synthase isoenzymes, MenF [[cite:PUB00014456]] and EntC [[cite:PUB00014431]]/DhbC [[cite:PUB00014434]], are known to be involved in MK and siderophore biosynthesis pathways, respectively [[cite:PUB00014410]]. MenF and EntC are differentially regulated and isochorismate synthesised by EntC is mainly channelled into enterobactin synthesis, whereas isochorismate synthesised by MenF is mainly channelled into menaquinone synthesis [[cite:PUB00014355]].</p>\n\n<p>The catalytic/chorismate binding domain characteristic of members of this group is related to other chorismate binding enzymes [[cite:PUB00014421]]: component I of anthranilate synthase, para-aminobenzoate synthase, and aminodeoxychorismate synthase (please see [InterPro:IPR005257]).</p>\n\n<p>There is a significant heterogeneity in the length and sequence of the N-terminal region of members of this group. Partially on the basis of the N-terminal region, the group can be divided into subfamilies, with the enzymes involved in DHB (enterobactin precursor) biosynthesis (EntC/DhbC/VibC) forming a distinct subfamily, and the enzymes involved in MK biosynthesis (MenF) forming two groups (E. coli and B. subtilis types).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family represents MenF both from E. coli and B. subtilis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bzm", "name" "Crystal Structure of Open form of Menaquinone-Specific Isochorismate Synthase, MenF"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR005801", "name" "ADC synthase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01935" "Isochorismate synthase MenF [menF]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isochorismate synthase MenF", "short" "MenF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 414, "taxa" 2443, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2643, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2643, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1946}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
