{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>One of the virulence mechanisms of Escherichia coli is the production of toxins from dedicated machineries called secretion systems. Seven secretion systems have been described, which assemble from 3 to up-to more than 20 subunits. These secretion systems derive from or have co-evolved with bacterial organelles such as ABC transporters (type I), type IV pili (type 2), flagella (type 3), or conjugative machines (type IV).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is present in most pathogens that have contact with animals, plants, or humans. T6SS exports Hcp (Haemolysin-Coregulated Protein) and a class of proteins named Vgr (Val-Gly Repeats), whose exact function is still speculative. In addition to Vgr and Hcp proteins, T6SS is characterised by the presence of an AAA+ Clp-like ATPase and of two additional genes icmF and dotU, encoding homologues of T4SS stabilising proteins [[cite:PUB00067798]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SciN is a lipoprotein tethered to the outer membrane and expressed in the periplasm of E. coli, and is essential for T6SS-dependent secretion of the Hcp-like SciD protein and for biofilm formation [[cite:PUB00067835]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zhn", "name" "Crystal structure of the T6SS lipoprotein TssJ1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038706", "name" "Type VI secretion protein SciN-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12790" "Type VI secretion lipoprotein, VasD, EvfM, TssJ, VC_A0113"}, "panther" {"PTHR37625" "OUTER MEMBRANE LIPOPROTEIN-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03352" "type VI secretion system lipoprotein TssJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type VI secretion system, lipoprotein SciN", "short" "T6SS_SciN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 814, "taxa" 5070, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7488, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5896}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0735", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0735"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017734", :literature {"PUB00067798" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Sexton JA" "Miller JL" "Yoneda A" "Kehl-Fie TE" "Vogel JP."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
