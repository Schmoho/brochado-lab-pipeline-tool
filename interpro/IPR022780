{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of several eukaryotic dynein light intermediate chain proteins. The light intermediate chains (LICs) of cytoplasmic dynein consist of multiple isoforms, which undergo post-translational modification to produce a large number of species. DLIC1 is known to be involved in assembly, organisation, and function of centrosomes and mitotic spindles when bound to pericentrin [[cite:PUB00019418], [cite:PUB00019419]]. DLIC2 is a subunit of cytoplasmic dynein 2 that may play a role in maintaining Golgi organisation by binding cytoplasmic dynein 2 to its Golgi-associated cargo [[cite:PUB00011311]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6b9h", "name" "Complex of Hook Domain with a Dynein Light Intermediate Chain Peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05783" "Dynein light intermediate chain (DLIC)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dynein family light intermediate chain", "short" "Dynein_light_int_chain"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 79, "proteomes" 2243, "taxa" 7595, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9116, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7199, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4622}, "pathways" 54}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022780", :literature {"PUB00019418" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Purohit A" "Tynan SH" "Vallee R" "Doxsey SJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
