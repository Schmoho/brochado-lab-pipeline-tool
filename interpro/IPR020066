{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cortexin is a neuron-specific, 82-residue membrane protein which is found especially in vertebrate brain cortex tissue. It may mediate extracellular or intracellular signalling of cortical neurons during forebrain development. Cortexin is present at significant levels in the foetal brain, suggesting that it may be important to neurons of both the developing and adult cerebral cortex. Cortexin has a conserved single membrane-spanning region in the middle of each sequence [[cite:PUB00045917]]. In humans, there is selective expression of Cortexin 3 (CTXN3) in the kidney as well as the brain [[cite:PUB00045918]]. This entry contains Cortexins 1, 2 and 3, and Cortexin domain-containing proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16736" "CORTEXIN-1-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF11057" "Cortexin of kidney"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cortexin", "short" "Cortexin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 642, "taxa" 2149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3022, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3021, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2159}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020066", :literature {"PUB00045917" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Coulter PM 2nd" "Bautista EA" "Margulies JE" "Watson JB."], "ISO_journal" "J.
