{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the H subunit of the magnesium chelatase complex responsible for magnesium insertion into the protoporphyrin IX ring in the biosynthesis of both chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll.  In chlorophyll-utilizing species, this gene is known as ChlH, while in bacteriochlorophyll-utilizing spoecies it is called BchH.  Subunit H is the largest (~140kDa) of the three subunits (the others being BchD/ChlD and BchI/ChlI), and is known to bind protoporphyrin IX.  Subunit H is homologous to the CobN subunit of cobaltochelatase and by anology with that enzyme, subunit H is believed to also bind the magnesium ion which is inserted into the ring.  In conjunction with the hydrolysis of ATP by subunits I and D, a conformation change is believed to happen in subunit H causing the magnesium ion insertion into the distorted protoporphyrin ring [[cite:PUB00015452]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02025" "magnesium chelatase subunit H"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Magnesium-chelatase, subunit H", "short" "BchH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 821, "taxa" 4133, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3034, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1154}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0144", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0144"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
