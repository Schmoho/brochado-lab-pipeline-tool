{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SNF5 is a component of the yeast SWI/SNF complex, which is an ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodelling complex that regulates the transcription of a subset of yeast genes. SNF5 is a key component of all SWI/SNF-class complexes characterised so far [[cite:PUB00008669]]. This family consists of the conserved region of SNF5, including a direct repeat motif. SNF5 is essential for the assembly promoter targeting and chromatin remodelling activity of the SWI-SNF complex [[cite:PUB00008670]]. SNF5 is also known as SMARCB1, for SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1, and also INI1 for integrase interactor 1. Loss-of function mutations in SNF5 are thought to contribute to oncogenesis in malignant rhabdoid tumours (MRTs) [[cite:PUB00008671]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04855" "SNF5 / SMARCB1 / INI1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SNF5/SMARCB1/INI1", "short" "SNF5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 133, "proteomes" 2490, "taxa" 8512, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6681, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4114}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2084", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2084"} {"accession" "GenProp2081", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2081"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006939", :literature {"PUB00008669" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Brzeski J" "Podstolski W" "Olczak K" "Jerzmanowski A."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/27.11.2393", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Identification and analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana BSH gene, a member of the SNF5 gene family.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "2393-9", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10325430}, "PUB00008670" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Geng F" "Cao Y" "Laurent BC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
