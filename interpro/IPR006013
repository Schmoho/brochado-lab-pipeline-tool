{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Marine teleosts from polar oceans can be protected from freezing in icy sea-water by serum antifreeze proteins (AFPs) or glycoproteins (AFGPs) [[cite:PUB00005271], [cite:PUB00032842]]: these function by binding to, and preventing the growth of, ice crystals within the fish. Despite functional similarity, the proteins are structurally diverse and include glycosylated and at least 3 non-glycosylated forms: the AFGP of notothenioids and cods are polymers of a tripeptide repeat, Ala-Ala-Thr, with a disaccharide attached to the threonine residue; type I AFPs are Ala-rich, α-helical peptides found in flounder and sculpin; type II AFPs of sea-raven, smelt and herring are Cys-rich proteins; and type III AFPs, found in eelpouts, are rich in β-structure [[cite:PUB00005271]]. As well as antifreeze proteins, entry also includes N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase from human and mouse (NANS/SIAS, formerly known sialic acid synthase) covering the C-terminal region. The function of this domain in SIAS is not known, but it may be involved in sugar binding [[cite:PUB00007091]]. NANS/SIAS catalyses the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) to synthesize N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate (Neu5Ac-9-P) [[cite:PUB00070658]]. It is required for brain and skeletal development [[cite:PUB00158953]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ucs", "name" "Type III Antifreeze Protein RD1 from an Antarctic Eel Pout"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036732", "name" "Antifreeze-like/N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00357" "ANTIFREEZIII"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Antifreeze, type III", "short" "Antifreeze_III"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 51, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 1068, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1564, "sets" 0, "proteins" 522, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 363}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
