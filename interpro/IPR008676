Together with two partly redundant non-coding RNAs, roX1 and roX2, they form the MSL complex, also known as dosage compensation complex or DCC. MSL complex upregulates transcription by spreading the histone H4 Lys16 (H4K16) acetyl mark [[cite:PUB00074563]] and allows compensation for the loss of one X-chromosomal allele by increasing the transcription from the retained allele [[cite:PUB00074561]].

This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. NuA4 complex may also play a direct role in DNA repair when directly recruited to sites of DNA damage. MRG15 is also a component of the mSin3A/Pf1/HDAC complex which acts to repress transcription by deacetylation of nucleosomal histones. MRG15 was found to interact with PALB2, a tumour suppressor protein that plays a crucial role in DNA damage repair by homologous recombination [[cite:PUB00060512]]. Furthermore, MRG15 play a role in the response to double strand breaks (DSBs) by recruiting the BRCA complex (BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51) to sites of damaged DNA [[cite:PUB00035439], [cite:PUB00060508]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5in1", "name" "Crystal Structure of the MRG701 chromodomain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038217", "name" "MRG, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038133" "NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, Eaf3/MRG15 subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR10880" "MORTALITY FACTOR 4-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MRG", "short" "MRG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2538, "taxa" 8662, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 2, "matches" 8507, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8455, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5414}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008676", :literature {"PUB00035439" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Doyon Y" "Selleck W" "Lane WS" "Tan S" "Cote J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
