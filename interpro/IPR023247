{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dynein-f, also known as dynein I1, is an inner-arm dynein complex comprising two different heavy chains together with a number of intermediate and light chains. In Chlamydomonas, IC97 is the intermediate chain of the Dynein-f complex. This entry includes IC97 ([swissprot:C7A2A8]) and its homologues, including CASC1 (also known as Dnai7) from humans [[cite:PUB00095099]].</p>\n\n<p>The CAncer Susceptibility Candidate 1 (CASC1) gene is expressed in lung tissues, and is a strong candidate for the pulmonary adenoma susceptibility 1 (Pas1) locus, the major determinant of strain variation in lung tumour susceptibility [[cite:PUB00054091]]. There appears to be a strong correlation between functional polymorphism of CASC1 and lung tumour suspectibility in mice [[cite:PUB00054092]].</p>\n\n<p>Different mouse strains fall into two genotype groups (susceptible and intermediate) according to differences in the 60th codon of the CASC1 gene [[cite:PUB00054092]]. The mouse CASC1 gene shares 81% similarity with the human equivalent; the role of CASC1 in human lung-cancer risk may nevertheless differ from that in mice [[cite:PUB00054091], [cite:PUB00054092]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02043" "Cancer susceptibility candidate protein 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR20929" "LUNG ADENOMA SUSCEPTIBILITY 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dynein-f, intermediate chain IC97/Dnai7-like", "short" "IC97/Dnai7-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 892, "taxa" 3824, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3313, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2364, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1519}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023247", :literature {"PUB00054091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Manenti G" "Galbiati F" "Pettinicchio A" "Spinola M" "Piconese S" "Leoni VP" "Conti B" "Ravagnani F" "Incarbone M" "Pastorino U" "Dragani TA."], "ISO_journal" "Carcinogenesis", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgi332", "medline_journal" "Carcinogenesis", "title" "A V141L polymorphism of the human LRMP gene is associated with survival of lung cancer patients.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1386-90", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16410263}, "PUB00054092" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Zhang Z" "Futamura M" "Vikis HG" "Wang M" "Li J" "Wang Y" "Guan KL" "You M."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
