It is a widely distributed enzyme, which catalyses the following reversible reaction:</p>\n\n<p><reaction> 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate = D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + acetaldehyde</reaction></p>\n\n<p>While the physiological role of this enzyme remains unknown in eukaryotes, in prokaryotes it is thought to function in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleotides [[cite:PUB00000628], [cite:PUB00028044]].</p>\n\n<p>In all studied structures, the deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase subunits adopt the classical eight-bladed TIM barrel fold [[cite:PUB00021873], [cite:PUB00016149], [cite:PUB00027586]]. The oligomerization state of the enzyme appears to depend on the living temperature of the organism - the Escherichia coli enzyme ([swissprot:P0A6L0]) is a homodimer, while the enzymes from the thermophilic microorganisms Thermus thermophilus and Aeropyrum pernix ([swissprot:Q9Y948]) are homotetramers. The degree of oligomerization does not, however, appear to affect catalysis.</p>\n\n<p>Deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase is unique in catalysing the aldol reaction between two aldehydes, and its broad substrate specificity confers considerable utility as a biocatalyst, offering an environmentally benign alternative to chiral transition metal catalysis of the asymmetric aldol reaction [[cite:PUB00080613], [cite:PUB00027586]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes divergent deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase-like protein (DPA) from Toxoplasma gondii which is involved in regulation of actin dynamics.
