{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many DNA viruses package their genomes in a reaction catalysed by a powerful DNA-packaging motor, a complex that consists of a dodecameric portal protein and a terminase that converts ATP hydrolysis into linear translation of DNA. The terminase is formed by a small subunit, which binds to packaging initiation sites to prepare for genome packaging, and a large subunit which has ATPase activity and binds directly to the portal protein.
