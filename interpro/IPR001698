{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The F-actin capping protein binds in a calcium-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) and thereby restricts its growth. The F-actin capping protein is a heterodimer composed of two unrelated subunits: alpha and beta. Neither of the subunits shows sequence similarity to other filament-capping proteins [[cite:PUB00002626]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the beta subunit (CAPZB), which is a protein of about 280 amino acid residues whose sequence is well conserved in eukaryotic species [[cite:PUB00004059]]. In Drosophila mutations in the alpha and beta subunits cause actin accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration [[cite:PUB00071410]]. In humans CAPZB is part of the WASH complex that controls the fission of endosomes [[cite:PUB00054152]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ds6", "name" "Crystal structure of actin capping protein in complex with twinflin-1/CD2AP CPI chimera peptide (TWN-CDC)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037282", "name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042276", "name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha/beta, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043175", "name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit beta, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10619" "F-ACTIN-CAPPING PROTEIN SUBUNIT BETA"}, "pfam" {"PF01115" "F-actin capping protein, beta subunit"}, "prints" {"PR00192" "FACTINCAPB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F-actin-capping protein subunit beta", "short" "CAPZB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 36, "domain_architectures" 82, "proteomes" 2551, "taxa" 8827, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5098, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5020, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3255}, "pathways" 51}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00203", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00203"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001698", :literature {"PUB00071410" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Delalle I" "Pfleger CM" "Buff E" "Lueras P" "Hariharan IK."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.105.049213", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Mutations in the Drosophila orthologs of the F-actin capping protein alpha- and beta-subunits cause actin accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1757-65", "volume" "171", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16143599}, "PUB00002626" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Maruyama K" "Kurokawa H" "Oosawa M" "Shimaoka S" "Yamamoto H" "Ito M" "Maruyama K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
