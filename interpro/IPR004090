{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are a family of bacterial receptors that mediate chemotaxis to diverse signals, responding to changes in the concentration of attractants and repellents in the environment by altering swimming behaviour [[cite:PUB00042592]]. Environmental diversity gives rise to diversity in bacterial signalling receptors, and consequently there are many genes encoding MCPs [[cite:PUB00042593]]. For example, there are four well-characterised MCPs found in Escherichia coli: Tar (taxis towards aspartate and maltose, away from nickel and cobalt), Tsr (taxis towards serine, away from leucine, indole and weak acids), Trg (taxis towards galactose and ribose) and Tap (taxis towards dipeptides).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry contains several methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, as well as related prokaryotic signalling receptors.
