{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The zona occuldens proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3) are a family of tight junction associated proteins that function as cross-linkers, anchoring the TJ strand proteins to the actin-based cytoskeleton [[cite:PUB00007799]]. Each protein contains three PDZ (postsynaptic density, disc-large, ZO-1) domains, a single SH3 (Src Homology-3) domain and a GK (guanylate kinase) domain, the presence of which identifies them as members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family. They also share an acidic domain at the C-terminal region of the molecules not found in other MAGUK proteins. It has been demonstrated that the first PDZ domain is involved in binding the C-terminal -Y-V motif of claudins [[cite:PUB00007800]]. By contrast, the occludin-binding domain of ZO-1 has been shown to lie in the GK and acidic domains [[cite:PUB00007801]]. Although the precise location of the actin-binding motif has not been elucidated, it appears to be within the C-terminal half of the molecules, since transfection of this region into fibroblasts induces co-localisation of ZO-1 and ZO-2 with actin fibres.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents ZO-2, which was first identified as a 160kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitates with ZO-1 [[cite:PUB00007804]]. It shares ~65% overall similarity with ZO-1 and ZO-3 proteins, with highest levels of similarity in the MAGUK and acid domains. In vitro binding studies indicate that ZO-2 may interact directly with ZO-1 through its second PDZ domain, although it does not appear to bind directly to ZO-3.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036034", "name" "PDZ superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01599" "ZONOCCLUDNS2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tight junction protein ZO-2", "short" "ZO-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 560, "taxa" 1918, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7725, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1945, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1108}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005419", :literature {"PUB00007799" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Itoh M" "Nagafuchi A" "Moroi S" "Tsukita S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
