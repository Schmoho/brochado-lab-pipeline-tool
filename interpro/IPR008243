{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chorismate mutase (CM) ([ec:5.4.99.5]) catalyses the conversion of chorismate to prephenate in the shikimate pathway of tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis in bacteria, fungi and plants [[cite:PUB00011077], [cite:PUB00094276]].</p>\n\n<p>The three types of CM are AroH class, AroQ class, prokaryotic type and AroQ class, eukaryotic type. Structurally CMs can be divided into two main groups: type I (AroH class) and type II (AroQ class). Type I (AroH) CMs include CMs characterised by a trimeric pseudo α/β barrel structure [[cite:PUB00094276]]. The two types of the AroQ structural class (the Escherichia coli CM dimer and the yeast CM monomer) can be structurally superimposed, and the topology of the four-helix bundle forming the active site is conserved [[cite:PUB00011060]]. CMs can be monofunctional or bifunctional (generally fused to another shikimate pathway member). Despite the structural differences, all CMs perform the same basic reaction [[cite:PUB00094276]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents chorismate mutases of the AroH class predominantly from Terrabacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ufy", "name" "Crystal analysis of chorismate mutase from thermus thermophilus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035959", "name" "RutC-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02185" "AroH"}, "profile" {"PS51167" "Chorismate mutase domain profile"}, "pfam" {"PF07736" "Chorismate mutase type I"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005965" "Chorismate mutase of the AroH class"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01796" "chorismate mutase"}, "panther" {"PTHR21164" "CHORISMATE MUTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chorismate mutase, AroH class", "short" "Chorismate_mutase_AroH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 1727, "taxa" 6494, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6590, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6587, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4962}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC51167", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC51167"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
