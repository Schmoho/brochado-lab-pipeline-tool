{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the caudal homeobox family, which includes homeotic protein caudal from Drosophila melanogaster (Cad), homeobox protein CDX-1 from human and similar proteins found in animals and some fungal species. Cad is a transcription factor involved in processes such as anterior/posterior patterning formation, organ morphogenesis and innate immune homeostasis. Postembryonically its function is mostly restricted to the intestine where it regulates antimicrobial peptide (AMP) levels preserving the normal gut flora [[cite:PUB00102043], [cite:PUB00102040], [cite:PUB00102044]]. CDX-1, is also involved in transcriptional regulation [[cite:PUB00102041]]. It may play a role in the terminal differentiation of the intestine. It binds preferentially to methylated DNA [[cite:PUB00102042]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes homeobox protein pal-1 from Caenorhabditis elegans, a transcriptional activator required for posterior V6 neuroectoblast cell fate specification during postembryonic neurogenesis (patterning) which generates the characteristic ray lineage during male tail development [[cite:PUB00102045], [cite:PUB00102046]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24332" "HOMEOBOX PROTEIN CDX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Caudal homeobox", "short" "Caudal_homeobox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1069, "taxa" 4386, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3572, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3572, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2483}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047152", :literature {"PUB00102045" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Baugh LR" "Hill AA" "Claggett JM" "Hill-Harfe K" "Wen JC" "Slonim DK" "Brown EL" "Hunter CP."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "The homeodomain protein PAL-1 specifies a lineage-specific regulatory network in the C. elegans embryo.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1843-54", "volume" "132", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15772128}, "PUB00102046" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Maduro MF" "Kasmir JJ" "Zhu J" "Rothman JH."], "ISO_journal" "Dev Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Dev Biol", "title" "The Wnt effector POP-1 and the PAL-1/Caudal homeoprotein collaborate with SKN-1 to activate C. elegans endoderm development.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "510-23", "volume" "285", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16084508}, "PUB00102040" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Hwang MS" "Kim YS" "Choi NH" "Park JH" "Oh EJ" "Kwon EJ" "Yamaguchi M" "Yoo MA."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The caudal homeodomain protein activates Drosophila E2F gene expression.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "5029-35", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12466526}, "PUB00102041" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Serra RW" "Fang M" "Park SM" "Hutchinson L" "Green MR."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "A KRAS-directed transcriptional silencing pathway that mediates the CpG island methylator phenotype.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e02313", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24623306}, "PUB00102042" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6337", "authors" ["Yin Y" "Morgunova E" "Jolma A" "Kaasinen E" "Sahu B" "Khund-Sayeed S" "Das PK" "Kivioja T" "Dave K" "Zhong F" "Nitta KR" "Taipale M" "Popov A" "Ginno PA" "Domcke S" "Yan J" "Schubeler D" "Vinson C" "Taipale J."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Impact of cytosine methylation on DNA binding specificities of human transcription factors.
