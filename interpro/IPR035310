{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Entamoeba histolytica, the Gal/GalNAc lectin contributes to its virulence by establishing adhesion to host cell [[cite:PUB00085317]]. The Gal/GalNAc lectin is a heterodimeric molecule composed of a transmembrane heavy (170kDa) subunit and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored light 31kDa and 35kDa subunits, which are non-covalently associated with an intermediate subunit of 150kDa [[cite:PUB00085317], [cite:PUB00085318]]. Inhibition of expression of 35kDa subunit of Gal/GalNAc lectin inhibits the cytotoxic and cytopathic activity of E. histolytica, but no decrease in adherence capacity to mammalian cells was evident. Interestingly, a carbohydrate-binding activity has been reported for the 35kDa light subunit of the lectin molecules of the closely related Entamoeba invadens  [[cite:PUB00085318]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17337" "Galactose-inhibitable lectin 35 kDa subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galactose/N-acetyl-D-galactosamine lectin light subunit 1", "short" "Gal_GalNac_light_su_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 75, "sets" 0, "proteins" 71, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 66}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035310", :literature {"PUB00085317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yadav R" "Verma K" "Chandra M" "Mukherjee M" "Datta S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
