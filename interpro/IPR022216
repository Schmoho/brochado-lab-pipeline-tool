The proteins in this family are frequently annotated as ABC Cobalt transporters however there is little accompanying literature to confirm this.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12558" "ATP-binding cassette cobalt transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative ABC cobalt transporter", "short" "ABC_Co_transporter"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 372, "taxa" 1825, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1543}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022216", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022216", "name" "Putative ABC cobalt transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 44, "alignment:full" 363}}}
