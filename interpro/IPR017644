{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes DndA, a protein related to IscS and part of a larger family of cysteine desulfurases. It is encoded, typically, divergently from a conserved, sparsely distributed operon for sulphur modification of DNA. This modification system is designated dnd, after the phenotype of DNA degradation during electrophoresis. The system is sporadically distributed in bacteria, much like some restriction enzyme operons. DndB is described as a putative ATPase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03235" "cysteine desulfurase DndA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine desulfurase DndA", "short" "Cysteine_desulfurase_DndA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 72, "taxa" 488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 224, "sets" 0, "proteins" 224, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 181}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0701", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0701"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017644", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016454", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR010240", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase IscS", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010970", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase, SufS", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR022471", "name" "Cysteine desulphurase, catalytic subunit, CsdA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR017644", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase DndA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017772", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase NifS, bacterial/archaeal", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017773", "name" "Cysteine desulfurase NifS, proteobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
