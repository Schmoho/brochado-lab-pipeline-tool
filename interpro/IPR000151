{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a member of the gp130 family of cytokines. CNTF is a survival factor for various neuronal cell types and seems to prevent the degeneration of motor axons after axotomy suggesting it may be a potential therapeutic for treating neurodegeneration and nerve injury. CNTF acts on oligodendrocytes by favoring their final maturation, and this effect is mediated through the 130kDa glycoprotein receptor common to the CNTF family and transduced through the Janus kinase pathway. The functional receptor complex of CNTF is composed of the CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR), gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15196" "CILIARY NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR"}, "pfam" {"PF01110" "Ciliary neurotrophic factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ciliary neurotrophic factor, CNTF", "short" "Ciliary_neurotrophic_fac_CNTF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 572, "taxa" 1979, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1199, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 788}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000151", :literature {"PUB00010131" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Stankoff B" "Aigrot MS" "Noel F" "Wattilliaux A" "Zalc B" "Lubetzki C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
