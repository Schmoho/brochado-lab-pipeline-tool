{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) sequences. The dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 4q21 [[cite:PUB00013072]]. DMP1 is a bone and teeth specific protein initially identified from mineralised dentin. DMP1 is primarily localised in the nuclear compartment of undifferentiated osteoblasts. In the nucleus, DMP1 acts as a transcriptional component for activation of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin. During the early phase of osteoblast maturation, Ca<sup>2+</sup>surges into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, triggering the phosphorylation of DMP1 by a nuclear isoform of casein kinase II. This phosphorylated DMP1 is then exported out into the extracellular matrix, where it regulates nucleation of hydroxyapatite. DMP1 is a unique molecule that initiates osteoblast differentiation by transcription in the nucleus and orchestrates mineralised matrix formation extracellularly, at later stages of osteoblast maturation [[cite:PUB00013073]]. The DMP1 gene has been found to be ectopically expressed in lung cancer although the reason for this is unknown [[cite:PUB00013074]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07263" "Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)"}, "panther" {"PTHR23400" "DENTIN MATRIX ACIDIC PHOSPHOPROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dentin matrix 1", "short" "DMP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 275, "taxa" 1777, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1104, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1063, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 699}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009889", :literature {"PUB00013072" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hirst KL" "Simmons D" "Feng J" "Aplin H" "Dixon MJ" "MacDougall M."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.1997.4700", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Elucidation of the sequence and the genomic organization of the human dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) gene: exclusion of the locus from a causative role in the pathogenesis of dentinogenesis imperfecta type II.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "38-45", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9177774}, "PUB00013073" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Narayanan K" "Ramachandran A" "Hao J" "He G" "Park KW" "Cho M" "George A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
