{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>cAMP-dependent kinase regulatory subunits play a crucial role in cAMP signaling within cells. They are involved in the regulation of protein kinases (PKA) activity by inhibiting the kinase in the absence of cAMP [[cite:PUB00155389], [cite:PUB00155391], [cite:PUB00155392]]. Upon binding of cAMP, these regulatory subunits undergo a conformational change that leads to the dissociation of the regulatory subunit dimer from the catalytic subunits, thus activating the kinase [[cite:PUB00031691]]. This family is involved in various cellular processes including the regulation of metabolic pathways, cell growth, and proliferation, as well as the rhythmic contraction of muscles and neuronal activity regulation in the brain [[cite:PUB00155390]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also contains cAMP/cGMP-dependent 3',5'-cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase B, thought to function as a cAMP-stimulated cAMP-phosphodiesterase which may play a role in regulating the cAMP relay response [[cite:PUB00138019], [cite:PUB00155393], [cite:PUB00136812]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Acetyltransferase Pat catalyses the acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of a highly conserved lysine residue in acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and of the universal stress protein (USP) MSMEG_4207.
