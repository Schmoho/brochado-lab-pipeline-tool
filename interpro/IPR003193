{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CD38, the HUGO gene name, is also called T10 or ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase ([ec:3.2.2.5]). CD38 is a novel enzyme capable of catalysing multiple reactions, including NAD glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase and base-exchange activities. Two of the enzymatic products, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), are calcium messengers in a wide variety of cells from protist, plant, and mammal to human. CD38 is a positive and negative regulator of cell activation and proliferation, depending on the cellular environment. It is involved in adhesion between human lymphocytes and endothelial cells and is involved in the metabolism of two calcium messengers, cADPR and NAADP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CD157 (also called BP-3/IF-7, BST-1 or Mo5) has ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase activities. CD157 supports the growth of a pre-B cell line, DW34. Anti-CD157 mAb IF-7 has synergistic effects on anti-CD3-induced growth of T progenitor cells, and facilitates the development of [alpha][beta] TCR+ cells in foetal thymic organ culture system.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5f21", "name" "human CD38 in complex with nanobody MU375"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04759" "ADP-ribosyl cyclase, also known as cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase or CD38"}, "pfam" {"PF02267" "ADP-ribosyl cyclase"}, "panther" {"PTHR10912" "ADP-RIBOSYL CYCLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosyl cyclase (CD38/157)", "short" "ADP-ribosyl_cyclase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 82, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 730, "taxa" 2614, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2271, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2212, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1556}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
