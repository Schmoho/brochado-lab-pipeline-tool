{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Microtubules are polymers of tubulin, a dimer of two 55kDa subunits, designated alpha and beta [[cite:PUB00000039], [cite:PUB00000978]]. Within the microtubule lattice, α-β heterodimers associate in a head-to-tail fashion, giving rise to microtubule polarity. Fluorescent labelling studies have suggested that tubulin is oriented in microtubules with beta-tubulin toward the plus end [[cite:PUB00006112]].</p>\n\n<p>For maximal rate and extent of polymerisation into microtubules, tubulin requires GTP. Two molecules of GTP are bound at different sites, termed N and E. At the E (Exchangeable) site, GTP is hydrolysed during incorporation into the microtubule. Close to the E site is an invariant region rich in glycine residues, which is found in both chains and is thought to control access of the nucleotide to its binding site [[cite:PUB00002443]].</p>\n\n<p>Most species, excepting simple eukaryotes, express a variety of closely-related alpha- and beta-isotypes. A third family member, gamma tubulin, has also been identified in a number of species. Gamma tubulin is found at microtubule-organising centres, such as the spindle poles or the centrosome, \nsuggesting that it is involved in minus-end nucleation of microtubule assembly [[cite:PUB00000721]]. Further eukaryotic tubulins (gamma, epsilon, zeta) that are restricted to certain lineages or species have been reported [[cite:PUB00072959], [cite:PUB00099927]].</p>\n\n<p>Bacterial and archaeal homologues of tubulin have been discovered. BtubA and BtubB, two bacterial homologues in the genus Prosthecobacter, have probably been derived by horizontal gene transfer [[cite:PUB00072957], [cite:PUB00039756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8cla", "name" "Z-SBTubA4 photoswitch bound to tubulin-DARPin D1 complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036525", "name" "Tubulin/FtsZ, GTPase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023123", "name" "Tubulin, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11588" "TUBULIN"}, "prints" {"PR01161" "TUBULIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tubulin", "short" "Tubulin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 704, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2766, "taxa" 27005, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 128160, "sets" 0, "proteins" 90542, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 67250}, "pathways" 233}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00199", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00199"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
