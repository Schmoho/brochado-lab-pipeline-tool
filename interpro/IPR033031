{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Nipped-B protein and its homologues, including Mis4 from fission yeast, Scc2 from budding yeast and Nipbl from zebrafish and Nipped-B from Drosophila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budding yeast Scc2 is known to be part of the loader for the cohesion to be loaded onto the chromosome [[cite:PUB00079283]]. It has also been shown to regulate gene expression independent of cohesin [[cite:PUB00079284]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drosophila melanogaster Nipped-B protein is a chromatin binding protein that is involved in sister chromatid cohesion. Nipped-B and its Mau-2 partner are required for cohesin to associate with chromosomes [[cite:PUB00077486]]. The Drosophila Nipped-B has also been shown to regulate gene expression [[cite:PUB00077484]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The zebrafish Nipbl has also been shown to regulate transcription. Nipbl has the ability to interact with other molecules such as histone deacetylases, HP-1gamma, and chromatin remodelling factors. It has been suggested that Nipbl is a cohesin-asociated scaffold protein that have functions other than loading cohesin [[cite:PUB00079285]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21704" "NIPPED-B-LIKE PROTEIN DELANGIN SCC2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Scc2/Nipped-B family", "short" "Scc2/Nipped-B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2569, "taxa" 8732, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7606, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2580}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033031", :literature {"PUB00077484" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Misulovin Z" "Schwartz YB" "Li XY" "Kahn TG" "Gause M" "MacArthur S" "Fay JC" "Eisen MB" "Pirrotta V" "Biggin MD" "Dorsett D."], "ISO_journal" "Chromosoma", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-007-0129-1", "medline_journal" "Chromosoma", "title" "Association of cohesin and Nipped-B with transcriptionally active regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "89-102", "volume" "117", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17965872}, "PUB00077485" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Tonkin ET" "Wang TJ" "Lisgo S" "Bamshad MJ" "Strachan T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
