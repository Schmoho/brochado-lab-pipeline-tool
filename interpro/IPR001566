{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the RlmD (also known as rumA / ygcA) RNA uridine methyltransferase. In E. coli, methyltransferases are responsible for converting uridine to thymidine in rRNA and tRNAs. Among them, TrmA is responsible for tRNA U54 methylation. RlmD (assigned as YgcA previously) was first identified as a methyltransferase through its homology to the TrmA family. RlmD was then found acting as a methyltransferase on the 23S RNA for the conserved U1939 [[cite:PUB00015406], [cite:PUB00015471]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1uwv", "name" "Crystal Structure of RumA, the iron-sulfur cluster containing E. coli 23S Ribosomal RNA 5-Methyluridine Methyltransferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01010" "23S rRNA (uracil(1939)-C(5))-methyltransferase RlmD [rlmD]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "23S rRNA (uracil(1939)-C(5))-methyltransferase RlmD", "short" "23S_rRNA_MeTrfase_RlmD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1462, "taxa" 7056, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6207}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
