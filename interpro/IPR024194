{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The biochemically characterised members of this group are enzymes that transfer organic acids, typically fatty acids, onto hydroxyl groups of membrane-embedded targets. They contain a characteristic domain for O-acyl transferases, [pfam:PF03062], in which a conserved histidine has been suggested to be the active site residue [[cite:PUB00007478]]. These enzymes are multispan membrane proteins involved in the modification of bacterial surface and extracellular polyliposaccharides that play a variety of roles in bacterial survival. Based on sequence similarity this family has been classified into two subgroups:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. DltB ([pirsf:PIRSF500216]): DltB orthologues are present in Gram-positive bacteria. The dlt operon is responsible for D-alanine esterification of both lipoteichoic acid and wall teichoic acid. The dlt operon contains five genes, dltA-dltE; dltB codes for the enzyme that transfers D-alanine to the wall lipotechtoic acids [[cite:PUB00013853]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. AlgI ([pirsf:PIRSF500217]): AlgI homologues are present mainly in Gram-negative bacteria, though there are a few members from Gram-positive bacteria. The<i>algI</i>gene is often linked to genes for type II membrane proteins that have the conserved amino acid motifs: P[x]K and RTD[x]HW. In Gram-negative bacteria, AlgI is involved in the synthesis of alginate (linear polymer of alpha L-gulunorate and beta-D-mannuronate linked by beta1-4 glycosidic bonds) [[cite:PUB00027722]]. AlgI paralogues in Pseudomonas syringae and Pseudomonas fluorescens are involved in the O-acetylation of cellulose [[cite:PUB00027792], [cite:PUB00027736]]. In the Gram-positive strain Clostridium acetobutylicum, an<i>algI</i>homologue is also adjacent to the cellulose biosynthetic genes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016636" "Alginate O-acetyltransferase AlgI/D-alanyl transfer protein DltB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alginate O-acetyltransferase AlgI/D-alanyl transfer protein DltB", "short" "Ac/AlaTfrase_AlgI/DltB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3301, "taxa" 15031, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26857, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19811}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
