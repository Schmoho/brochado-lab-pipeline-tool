{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Notch cell surface receptors are large, single-pass type-1 transmembrane proteins found in a diverse range of metazoan species, from human to Caenorhabditis species. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, possesses only one Notch protein, whereas in C.elegans, two receptors have been found; by contrast, four Notch paralogues (designated N1-4) have been identified in mammals, playing both unique and redundant roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hetero-oligomer Notch comprises a large extracellular domain (ECD), containing 10-36 tandem Epidermal Growth Factor (EFG)-like repeats, which are involved in ligand interactions; a negative regulatory region, including three cysteine-rich Lin12-Notch Repeats (LNR); a single trans-membrane domain (TM); a small intracellular domain (ICD), which includes a RAM (RBPjk-association module) domain; six ankyrin repeats (ANK), which are involved in protein-protein interactions; and a PEST domain. Drosophila Notch also contains an OPA domain [[cite:PUB00053622]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notch signalling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway involved in a wide variety of developmental processes, including adult homeostasis and stem cell maintenance, cell proliferation and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00013432]]. Notch is activated by a range of ligands -the so-called DSL ligands (Delta/Seratte/LAG-2). Activation is also mediated by a sequence of proteolytic events: ligand binding leads to cleavage of Notch by ADAM proteases [[cite:PUB00053623]] at site 2 (S2) and presenilin-1/g-secretase at sites 3 (S3)and 4 (S4) [[cite:PUB00053638]].The last cleavage releases the Notch intracellular part of the protein (NICD) from the membrane and, upon release, the NICD translocates to the nucleus where it associates with a CBF1/RBJk/Su(H)/Lag1 (CSL) family of DNA-binding proteins. The subsequent recruitment of a co-activator mastermind like (MAML1) protein [[cite:PUB00053624]] promotes transcriptional activation of Notch target genes: well established Notch targets are the Hes and Hey gene families.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Notch 4 is selectively expressed in vascular endothelium, and regulates vascular remodelling [[cite:PUB00053661]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01987" "Neurogenic locus Notch protein 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neurogenic locus Notch 4", "short" "Notch_4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2134, "sets" 0, "proteins" 321, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022355", :literature {"PUB00053624" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wu L" "Aster JC" "Blacklow SC" "Lake R" "Artavanis-Tsakonas S" "Griffin JD."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
