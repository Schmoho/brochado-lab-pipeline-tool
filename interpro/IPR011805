{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonuclease R (RNaseR) is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease that releases 5'-nucleoside monophosphates and is involved in maturation of structured RNAs [[cite:PUB00015537], [cite:PUB00056800]]. It is one of the eight exoribonucleases reported in Escherichia coli and is broadly distributed throughout the bacteria. In E. coli, double mutants of this protein and polynucleotide phosphorylase are not viable.
