{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Defects in human HPS1 are the cause of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 (HPS1). Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an often-fatal autosomal recessive disease in which albinism, bleeding, and lysosomal storage result from defects of diverse cytoplasmic organelles: melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and lysosomes [[cite:PUB00059923], [cite:PUB00059924]].</p>\n\n<p>Human HPS1 is a transmembrane protein component of the BLOC-3 complex, a complex that acts as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for RAB32 and RAB38, promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting them from an inactive GDP-bound form into an active GTP-bound form. The BLOC-3 complex plays an important role in the control of melanin production and melanosome biogenesis and promotes the membrane localization of RAB32 and RAB38 [[cite:PUB00094653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12761" "HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BLOC-3 complex member HPS1", "short" "HPS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 828, "taxa" 3523, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1920, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1920, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1258}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026053", :literature {"PUB00059923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Oh J" "Ho L" "Ala-Mello S" "Amato D" "Armstrong L" "Bellucci S" "Carakushansky G" "Ellis JP" "Fong CT" "Green JS" "Heon E" "Legius E" "Levin AV" "Nieuwenhuis HK" "Pinckers A" "Tamura N" "Whiteford ML" "Yamasaki H" "Spritz RA."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
