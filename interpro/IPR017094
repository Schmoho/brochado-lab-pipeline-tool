{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents biliverdin reductase A enzymes ([ec:1.3.1.24]), reduces biliverdin (the product of haem oxygenases HO-1 and HO-2 activity) to the antioxidant bilirubin. It works by catalysing the reduction of the gamma-methene bridge of the open tetrapyrrole, biliverdin IX alpha, to bilirubin with the concomitant oxidation of a NADH or NADPH cofactor. This reaction is involved in the protohaem degradation pathway as part of porphyrin metabolism. Some enzymes are thought to use zinc as a cofactor. Human biliverdin reductase may also functions as a kinase and as a transcription factor in the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling cascade [[cite:PUB00044616]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gcu", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF RAT BILIVERDIN REDUCTASE AT 1.4 A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037032" "Biliverdin reductase A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biliverdin reductase A", "short" "Biliverdin_Rdtase_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 378, "taxa" 1311, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 588, "sets" 0, "proteins" 574, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 407}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
