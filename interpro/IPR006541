{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences represent a family of integral membrane proteins, most of which are about 650 residues in size and predicted to span the membrane seven times. Nearly half of the members of this family are found in association with a member of the lactococcin 972 family of bacteriocins ([interpro:IPR006540]) [[cite:PUB00009668]]. Others may be associated with uncharacterised proteins that may also act as bacteriocins. Although this protein is suggested to be an immunity protein, and the bacteriocin is suggested to be exported by a Sec-dependent process, the role of this protein is unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07242" "Protein of unknown function (DUF1430)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01654" "bacteriocin-associated integral membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriocin-associated integral membrane protein", "short" "Bacteriocin_ass"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 131, "taxa" 837, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1435, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1115}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0809", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0809"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006541", :literature {"PUB00009668" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Martinez B" "Fernandez M" "Suarez JE" "Rodriguez A."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Synthesis of lactococcin 972, a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis IPLA 972, depends on the expression of a plasmid-encoded bicistronic operon.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "3155-61", "volume" "145 ( Pt 11)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10589723}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006541", "name" "Bacteriocin-associated integral membrane protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016976", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP031601", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 17, "alignment:full" 146}}}
