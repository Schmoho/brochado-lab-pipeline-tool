Eukaryotes usually have two separate enzymes, while most prokaryotes have a single bifunctional protein that can carry out both catalyses, although exceptions occur in both cases. While eukaryotic monofunctional riboflavin kinase is orthologous to the bifunctional prokaryotic enzyme [[cite:PUB00030175]], the monofunctional FAD synthetase differs from its prokaryotic counterpart, and is instead related to the PAPS-reductase family [[cite:PUB00035657]]. The bacterial FAD synthetase that is part of the bifunctional enzyme has remote similarity to nucleotidyl transferases and, hence, it may be involved in the adenylylation reaction of FAD synthetases [[cite:PUB00010127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036620" "Predicted FAD synthetase with molybdopterin binding domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAD synthetase with the MoaB/Mog domain", "short" "FAD_synth_MoaB/Mog-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 446, "taxa" 1520, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 654, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 464}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
