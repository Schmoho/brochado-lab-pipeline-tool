{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins found in Caenorhabditis called LIN-8, previously known as DUF278.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIN-8 is a nuclear protein, present at the sites of transcriptional repressor complexes, which interacts with LIN-35 Rb. Lin35 Rb is a product of the class B synMuv gene lin-35 which silences genes required for vulval specification through chromatin modification and remodelling [[cite:PUB00083139]]. The biological role of the interaction has not yet been determined however predictions have been made. The interaction shows that class A synMuv genes control vulval induction through the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. LIN-8 normally functions as part of a protein complex however when the complex is absent, other family members can partially replace LIN-8 activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32020" "LIN-8 DOMAIN CONTAINING-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03353" "Ras-mediated vulval-induction antagonist"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein LIN-8", "short" "LIN-8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 28, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 254, "sets" 0, "proteins" 218, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 178}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005020", :literature {"PUB00083139" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Davison EM" "Harrison MM" "Walhout AJ" "Vidal M" "Horvitz HR."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.034173", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "lin-8, which antagonizes Caenorhabditis elegans Ras-mediated vulval induction, encodes a novel nuclear protein that interacts with the LIN-35 Rb protein.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1017-31", "volume" "171", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16020796}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005020", "name" "Protein LIN-8", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 19, "alignment:full" 147}}}
