{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, is also called ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The plant form is an alpha2, beta2 heterodimer, allosterically regulated in plants [[cite:PUB00032683]]. Both subunits are homologous and included in this entry. In bacteria, both homomeric forms of GlgC and more active heterodimers of GlgC and GlgD have been described [[cite:PUB00086423]]. This entry describes the GlgC subunit only. This enzyme appears in variants of glycogen synthesis pathways that use ADP-glucose, rather than UDP-glucose as in animals.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5w5t", "name" "Agrobacterium tumefaciens ADP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase bound to activator ethyl pyruvate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43523" "GLUCOSE-1-PHOSPHATE ADENYLYLTRANSFERASE-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02091" "glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase", "short" "ADP-Glc_PPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5519, "taxa" 21648, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35830, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35830, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26618}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1247", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1247"} {"accession" "GenProp0168", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0168"} {"accession" "GenProp0264", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0264"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
