Uracil is removed in a base-excision repair pathway by uracil DNA-glycosylase (UDG), which excises uracil from both single- and double-stranded DNA. The uracil DNA glycosylase family 2 consists of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) from eukaryotes and mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) from prokaryotes.</p>\n\n<p>Thymine DNA glycosylases (TDG) in eukaryotic organisms are known for their double-stranded glycosylase activity on guanine/uracil (G/U) base pairs [[cite:PUB00095804]]. In human TDG removes uracil and thymine from G:U and G:T mismatches in double-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00008091], [cite:PUB00080609]]. In E. coli MUG is highly specific to G:U mismatches but also repairs G:T mismatches at high enzyme concentration. Structural studies of E. coli MUG reveal its structural homology to UDG despite low sequence identity. It has a specific uracil-binding pocket located in a DNA-binding groove and this specificity is likely the result of a multistep lesion recognition process [[cite:PUB00008091]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mug", "name" "G:T/U MISMATCH-SPECIFIC DNA GLYCOSYLASE FROM E.COLI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036895", "name" "Uracil-DNA glycosylase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01956" "G/U mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase [mug]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G/U mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase MUG, bacterial", "short" "MUG_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 725, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 833, "sets" 0, "proteins" 833, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 612}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
