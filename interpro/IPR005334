{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tctex-1 is a dynein light chain. Dynein translocates rhodopsin-bearing vesicles along microtubules and it has been shown that Tctex-1 can bind to the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin for retrograde or apical transport [[cite:PUB00038504]]. An efficient vectorial transport system must be required to deliver large numbers of newly synthesised rhodopsin molecules (~10<SUP>7</SUP>molecules per day per photoreceptor) to the base of the outer segment of the photoreceptor, Tctex-1 may well play a role in this process. C-terminal rhodopsin mutations responsible for retinitis pigmentosa inhibit the interaction between Tctex-1 and rhodopsin, which may be the molecular basis of retinitis pigmentosa [[cite:PUB00020416]].</p>\n\n<p>In the mouse, the chromosomal location and pattern of expression of Tctex-1 make it a candidate for involvement in male sterility [[cite:PUB00007752]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Topoisomerase I damage affected protein 2 (TDA2) whose crystal structure revealed that it belongs to the dynein light chain family. It is part of the endocytic machinery and required for normal internalisation of native cargo in yeast [[cite:PUB00095613]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ygt", "name" "Dynein Light Chain TcTex-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038586", "name" "Tctex-1-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03645" "Tctex-1 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR21255" "T-COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED-TESTIS-EXPRESSED 1/ DYNEIN LIGHT CHAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dynein light chain Tctex-1 like", "short" "Tctex-1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 131, "proteomes" 2254, "taxa" 7787, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7665}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005334", :literature {"PUB00007752" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Lader E" "Ha HS" "O'Neill M" "Artzt K" "Bennett D."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(89)90948-3", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "tctex-1: a candidate gene family for a mouse t complex sterility locus.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "969-79", "volume" "58", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2570638}, "PUB00020416" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Tai AW" "Chuang JZ" "Bode C" "Wolfrum U" "Sung CH."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80800-4", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Rhodopsin's carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail acts as a membrane receptor for cytoplasmic dynein by binding to the dynein light chain Tctex-1.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "877-87", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10399916}, "PUB00095613" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Farrell KB" "McDonald S" "Lamb AK" "Worcester C" "Peersen OB" "Di Pietro SM."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "Novel function of a dynein light chain in actin assembly during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "2565-2580", "volume" "216", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28706108}, "PUB00038504" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Williams JC" "Xie H" "Hendrickson WA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
