{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic GPP34 like proteins. GPP34 (also known as golgi phosphoprotein 3) localises to the Golgi complex and is conserved from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to humans. The cytosolic-ally exposed location of GPP34 predicts a role for a novel coat protein in Golgi trafficking [[cite:PUB00011343]]. The budding yeast GPP34 homologue, also known as Vps74, is a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-binding protein that links Golgi membranes to the cytoskeleton and may participate in the tensile force required for vesicle budding from the Golgi [[cite:PUB00061522]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family also includes uncharacterized proteins from bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038261", "name" "Golgi phosphoprotein 3-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12704" "TRANS-GOLGI PROTEIN GMX33"}, "pfam" {"PF05719" "Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GPP34)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Golgi phosphoprotein 3-like", "short" "GPP34-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 64, "proteomes" 3508, "taxa" 11686, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11903, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11819, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8288}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008628", :literature {"PUB00011343" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Bell AW" "Ward MA" "Blackstock WP" "Freeman HN" "Choudhary JS" "Lewis AP" "Chotai D" "Fazel A" "Gushue JN" "Paiement J" "Palcy S" "Chevet E" "Lafreniere-Roula M" "Solari R" "Thomas DY" "Rowley A" "Bergeron JJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
