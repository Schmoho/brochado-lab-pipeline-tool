{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several neural proliferation differentiation control-1 (NPDC1) proteins. NPDC1 plays a role in the control of neural cell proliferation and differentiation. It has been suggested that NPDC1 may be involved in the development of several secretion glands. This family also contains the C-terminal region of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein CAB-1 ([swissprot:Q93249]) which is known to interact with AEX-3 [[cite:PUB00012844]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06809" "Neural proliferation differentiation control-1 protein (NPDC1)"}, "panther" {"PTHR23352" "NEURAL PROLIFERATION DIFFERENTIATION AND CONTROL PROTEIN-1 NPDC-1 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neural proliferation differentiation control-1", "short" "NPDC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 933, "taxa" 3706, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2118, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1986, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1317}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009635", :literature {"PUB00012844" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Iwasaki K" "Toyonaga R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/19.17.4806", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange factor homolog AEX-3 has a dual function in synaptic transmission.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "4806-16", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10970871}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009635", "name" "Neural proliferation differentiation control-1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 1497}}}
