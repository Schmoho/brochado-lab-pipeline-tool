{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family refers to Alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate 5-triphosphate diphosphatase (also known as RPnTP diphosphatase or PhnM). PhnM is associated with phosphonate utilization in a number of bacterial species. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate triphosphate (RPnTP) to form alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate phosphate (PRPn) and diphosphate [[cite:PUB00079189]]. It is one of seven gene products (PhnG-PhnM) that participate in the catalysis of degradation of alkylphosphonates and are components of membrane associated C-P lyase complex [[cite:PUB00033214]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011059", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase, composite domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01306" "PhnM"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF038971" "Predicted metal dependent hydrolase, PhnM type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02318" "phosphonate metabolism protein PhnM"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonate metabolism PhnM", "short" "PhnM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1395, "taxa" 5921, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6952, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6863, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5360}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"} {"accession" "GenProp1630", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1630"} {"accession" "GenProp1381", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1381"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
