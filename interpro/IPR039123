{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Protein phosphatase PTC7 homologue fig from Drosophila, Protein phosphatase PTC7 homologue from human and related proteins. Human PTC7 is a protein phosphatase which positively regulates biosynthesis of the ubiquinone, coenzyme Q [[cite:PUB00101508]]. It dephosphorylates the ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ7 which is likely to lead to its activation [[cite:PUB00101508]]. The homologue from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is known as 5-azacytidine resistance protein azr1, because it suppresses sensitivity to the C5 DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine [[cite:PUB00089501]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ae9", "name" "X-ray structure of the photosystem II phosphatase PBCP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036457", "name" "PPM-type phosphatase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12320" "PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase PTC7 homolog", "short" "PPTC7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2618, "taxa" 8965, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6593}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
