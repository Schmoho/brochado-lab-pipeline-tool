Although the mechanisms of aminoacid racemisation and epimerisation are conserved between proline racemase and hydroxyproline epimerase, substrate specificity partly rely on constraints imposed by certain residues distinctively belonging to the catalytic pocket  [[cite:PUB00067368]]. A human proline racemase-like gene, lacking a specific cysteine residue critical for racemase activity, has been identified as a trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase [[cite:PUB00067369]].
