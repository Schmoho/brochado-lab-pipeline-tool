{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tellurite resistance protein TehB is part of a tellurite-reducing operon tehA and tehB. When present in high copy number, TehB is responsible for potassium tellurite resistance, probably by increasing the reduction rate of tellurite to metallic tellurium within the bacterium. TehB is a cytoplasmic protein which possesses three conserved motifs (I, II, and III) found in S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent non-nucleic acid methyltransferases [[cite:PUB00014885]]. Conformational changes in TehB are observed upon binding of both tellurite and SAM, suggesting that TehB utilises a methyltransferase activity in the detoxification of tellurite.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xvm", "name" "Crystal structure of the tellurite detoxification protein TehB from E. coli in complex with SAH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00477" "tellurite resistance methyltransferase TehB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tellurite resistance methyltransferase, TehB", "short" "Tellurite-R_MeTrfase_TehB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 234, "taxa" 2004, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2338, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2338, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1782}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
