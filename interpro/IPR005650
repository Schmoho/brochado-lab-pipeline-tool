{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are transcriptional regulators found in a variety of bacteria and a small number of archaea. Many are BlaI/MecI proteins which regulate resistance to penicillins (beta-lactams), though at least one protein ([swissprot:Q47839]) appears to be involved in the regulation of copper homeostasis [[cite:PUB00028063]]. BlaI regulators repress the expression of penicillin-degrading enzymes (penicillinases) until the cell encounters the antiobiotic, at which point repression ceases and penicillinase expression occurs, allowing cell growth [[cite:PUB00028064]]. MecI regulators repress the expression of MecA, a cell-wall biosynthetic enzyme not inhibited by penicillins at clinically achievable concentrations, until the presence of the antibiotic is detected [[cite:PUB00028065]]. At this point repression ends and MecA expression occurs which, together with the switching off of the penicillin-sensitive enzymes, allows the cell to grow despite the presence of antibiotic.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sd4", "name" "Crystal Structure of a SeMet derivative of BlaI at 2.0 A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03965" "Penicillinase repressor"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019455" "Copper-responsive transcriptional repressor, CopR/AtkY type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BlaI transcriptional regulatory family", "short" "BlaI_family"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 55, "proteomes" 4575, "taxa" 17196, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35292, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26647}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005650", :literature {"PUB00028063" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Odermatt A" "Solioz M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
