{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of Rossmann fold oxidoreductases that catalyse NADPH-dependent hydroxylation and are involved in siderophore biosynthesis. This family includes L-ornithine 5-monooxygenase, which catalyses the hydroxylation of L-ornithine at the N5 position [[cite:PUB00057881], [cite:PUB00097965]], and L-lysine 6-monooxygenase, which catalyses the hydroxylation of lysine at the N6 position [[cite:PUB00057882]]. This entry also includes Putrescine N-hydroxylase, an homologous of L-ornithine 5-monooxygenase and L-lysine 6-monooxygenase [[cite:PUB00154953]], involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophore putrebactin [[cite:PUB00154953]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3s5w", "name" "Ornithine Hydroxylase (PvdA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42802" "MONOOXYGENASE"}, "pfam" {"PF13434" "L-lysine 6-monooxygenase/L-ornithine 5-monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-lysine 6-monooxygenase/L-ornithine 5-monooxygenase", "short" "Lys/Orn_oxygenase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 86, "proteomes" 2875, "taxa" 11133, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14239, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14214, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10650}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
