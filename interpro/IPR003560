The enzymic machinery that produces vibrionectin in Vibrio cholerae is such a homologue [[cite:PUB00006668]].</p>\r\n<p>EntA, a 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase enzyme, is the third enzyme in the biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) from chorismate in Escherichia coli. It converts isochorismate to DHB, used for the synthesis of iron chelator enterobactin. Bacillus subtilis possesses similar genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00064927]].
