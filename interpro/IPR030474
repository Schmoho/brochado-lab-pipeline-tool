{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin-6 (IL6), also refered to as B-cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2) and interferon beta-2, is a cytokine involved in a wide variety of biological functions [[cite:PUB00003997]]. It plays an essential role in the final differentiation of B-cells into IG-secreting cells, as well as inducing myeloma/plasmacytoma growth, nerve cell differentiation and, in hepatocytes, acute phase reactants [[cite:PUB00003997], [cite:PUB00001608]].</p>\n\n<p>A number of other cytokines may be grouped with IL6 on the basis of sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00003997], [cite:PUB00001608], [cite:PUB00000150]]: these include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and myelomonocytic growth factor (MGF). GCSF acts in hematopoiesis by affecting the production, differentiation and function of 2 related white cell groups in the blood [[cite:PUB00000150]]. MGF also acts in hematopoiesis, stimulating proliferation and colony formation of normal and transformed avian cells of the myeloid lineage.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1alu", "name" "HUMAN INTERLEUKIN-6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00126" "Interleukin-6 homologues"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001935" "Interleukin-6"}, "prints" {"PR00433" "IL6GCSFMGF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-6/GCSF/MGF", "short" "IL-6/GCSF/MGF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 579, "taxa" 2032, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1645, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1204}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030474", :literature {"PUB00003997" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6092", "authors" ["Hirano T" "Yasukawa K" "Harada H" "Taga T" "Watanabe Y" "Matsuda T" "Kashiwamura S" "Nakajima K" "Koyama K" "Iwamatsu A."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/324073a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Complementary DNA for a novel human interleukin (BSF-2) that induces B lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin.", "year" 1986, "raw_pages" "73-6", "volume" "324", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3491322}, "PUB00001608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lutticken C" "Kruttgen A" "Moller C" "Heinrich PC" "Rose-John S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(91)80491-K", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Evidence for the importance of a positive charge and an alpha-helical structure of the C-terminus for biological activity of human IL-6.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "265-7", "volume" "282", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2037043}, "PUB00000150" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Clogston CL" "Boone TC" "Crandall BC" "Mendiaz EA" "Lu HS."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
