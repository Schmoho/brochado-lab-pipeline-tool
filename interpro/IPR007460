{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>BrnT is a ribonuclease toxin of a type II toxin-antitoxin system that exhibits a RelE-like fold. The antitoxin that neutralises this toxin is ([interpro:IPR025528]). BrnT is found in bacteria, archaea, bacteriophage, and plasmids. BrnT-BrnA forms a 2:2 tetrameric complex and autoregulates its own expression, which is induced by a number of different environmental stresses. Expression of BrnT alone results in cessation of bacterial growth which can be rescued after subsequent expression of BrnA [[cite:PUB00058380]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7vd7", "name" "Toxin - Antitoxin complex from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038573", "name" "Ribonuclease toxin BrnT superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04365" "Ribonuclease toxin, BrnT, of type II toxin-antitoxin system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease toxin, BrnT, of type II toxin-antitoxin system", "short" "BrnT_toxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 1379, "taxa" 8688, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15382, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15381, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11538}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007460", :literature {"PUB00058380" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Heaton BE" "Herrou J" "Blackwell AE" "Wysocki VH" "Crosson S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
