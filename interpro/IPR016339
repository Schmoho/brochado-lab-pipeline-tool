{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of haemoglobin-like proteins found in eubacteria, cyanobacteria, protozoa, and plants, but not in animals or yeast [[cite:PUB00073497]]. Truncated hemoglobins (TrHbs) have a truncated 2-over-2 rather than the canonical 3-over-3 Î±-helical sandwich fold [[cite:PUB00035871]]. The variability of the amino acid residues of the heme pocket suggested their partition into three groups that share less than 30% sequence similarity with each other [[cite:PUB00073497]]. This entry includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>HbN (or GlbN): a truncated haemoglobin-like protein that binds oxygen cooperatively with a very high affinity and a slow dissociation rate, which may exclude it from oxygen transport. It appears to be involved in bacterial nitric oxide detoxification and in nitrosative stress [[cite:PUB00035878], [cite:PUB00073498]].</li>\r\n<li>Cyanoglobin (or GlbN): a truncated haemoprotein found in cyanobacteria that has high oxygen affinity, and which appears to serve as part of a terminal oxidase, rather than as a respiratory pigment [[cite:PUB00035880]].</li>\r\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4max", "name" "Crystal structure of Synechococcus sp.
