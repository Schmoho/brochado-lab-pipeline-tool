{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein found encoded in F1F0-ATPase operons in several genomes, including Methanosarcina barkeri (archaeal) and Chlorobium tepidum (bacterial). It is a small protein (about 100 amino acids) with long hydrophobic stretches and is presumed to be a subunit of the enzyme. It carries two transmembrane helices and is a magnesium or calcium uniporter. The atp operon of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, as in most prokaryotes, contains the eight structural genes for the F-ATPase (ATP synthase), which are preceded by an atpI gene that encodes a membrane protein with 2 TMSs. A tenth gene, atpZ, has been found in this operon, which is upstream of and overlapping with atpI [[cite:PUB00013531]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09527" "Putative F0F1-ATPase subunit Ca2+/Mg2+ transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative F0F1-ATPase subunit, Ca2+/Mg2+ transporter", "short" "ATPase_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 3891, "taxa" 15503, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18879, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18875, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14603}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032820", :literature {"PUB00013531" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Hicks DB" "Wang Z" "Wei Y" "Kent R" "Guffanti AA" "Banciu H" "Bechhofer DH" "Krulwich TA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
