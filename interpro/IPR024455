{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this family are found in bacteria and viruses (Caudovirales) and represent bacteriophage capsid proteins. The major capsid protein of Enterobacteria phage HK97 assembles to form an icosahedral capsid [[cite:PUB00046522], [cite:PUB00100782]]. Included within the capsid protein is the delta domain which acts as the scaffold upon which the capsid is built [[cite:PUB00065553]]. Bacterial and archaeal encapsulin-like systems and HK97-type viruses share a common ancestor and it is likely that encapsulins have evolved from HK97-type phages [cite:PUB00100782]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01554" "phage major capsid protein, HK97 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage capsid", "short" "Phage_capsid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4071, "taxa" 17958, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22731, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22691, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13901}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024455", :literature {"PUB00046522" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5487", "authors" ["Wikoff WR" "Liljas L" "Duda RL" "Tsuruta H" "Hendrix RW" "Johnson JE."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5487.2129", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Topologically linked protein rings in the bacteriophage HK97 capsid.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2129-33", "volume" "289", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11000116}, "PUB00065553" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Huang RK" "Khayat R" "Lee KK" "Gertsman I" "Duda RL" "Hendrix RW" "Johnson JE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
