{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gluten is the protein component of Triticum aestivum (Wheat) flour. It consists of numerous proteins, which are of 2 different types responsible for different physical properties of dough: the glutenins, which are primarily responsible for the elasticity, and the gliadins, which contribute to the extensibility. The glutenins themselves are of 2 different types, termed low and high [[cite:PUB00004336]] molecular weight subunits. The latter have unusual structures: a central region contains multiple tandem repeats of blocks of amino acids, forming a loose helix based on Î² reverse turns, and is flanked by globular regions, which can be cross-linked by disulphide bonds. The result is an elastic network in which the elasticity may derive from the cross-linking, the helical structure, or a combination of these [[cite:PUB00004360]].</p>\n\n<p>The gliadins are also of different types (e.g., alpha/beta or gamma) and, like the glutenins, contain repetitive sequences [[cite:PUB00002416]] that form loose helical structures, but are usually associated with more extensive non-repetitive regions, which are compact and globular [[cite:PUB00001754]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes avenin-like proteins, which are considered atypical gluten constituents [[cite:PUB00082623]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036312", "name" "Bifunctional inhibitor/plant lipid transfer protein/seed storage helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33454" "PROLAMIN PPROL 14P"}, "prints" {"PR00208" "GLIADGLUTEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliadin/LMW glutenin", "short" "Glia_glutenin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 35, "taxa" 365, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7709, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4978, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4649}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001954", :literature {"PUB00004336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Thompson RD" "Bartels D" "Harberd NP."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/13.19.6833", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Nucleotide sequence of a gene from chromosome 1D of wheat encoding a HMW-glutenin subunit.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "6833-46", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3840588}, "PUB00004360" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Anderson OD" "Greene FC" "Yip RE" "Halford NG" "Shewry PR" "Malpica-Romero JM."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.1.461", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Nucleotide sequences of the two high-molecular-weight glutenin genes from the D-genome of a hexaploid bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L. cv Cheyenne.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "461-2", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2563152}, "PUB00002416" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Okita TW" "Cheesbrough V" "Reeves CD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
