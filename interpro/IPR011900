{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutaredoxins [[cite:PUB00001738], [cite:PUB00000560], [cite:PUB00002504]], also known as thioltransferases (disulphide reductases), are small proteins of approximately one hundred amino-acid residues which utilise glutathione and NADPH as cofactors. Oxidized glutathione is regenerated by glutathione reductase.  Together these components compose the glutathione system [[cite:PUB00014033]].</p>\n\n<p>Glutaredoxin functions as an electron carrier in the glutathione-dependent synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Like thioredoxin (TRX), which functions in a similar way, glutaredoxin possesses an active centre disulphide bond [[cite:PUB00015562]]. It exists in either a reduced or an oxidized form where the two cysteine residues are linked in an intramolecular disulphide bond. It contains a redox active CXXC motif in a TRX fold and uses a similar dithiol mechanism employed by TRXs for intramolecular disulfide bond reduction of protein substrates. Unlike TRX, GRX has preference for mixed GSH disulfide substrates, in which it uses a monothiol mechanism where only the N-terminal cysteine is required. The flow of reducing equivalents in the GRX system goes from NADPH ->GSH reductase ->GSH ->GRX ->protein substrates [[cite:PUB00023503], [cite:PUB00030238], [cite:PUB00080927], [cite:PUB00080925]]. By altering the redox state of target proteins, GRX is involved in many cellular functions including DNA synthesis, signal transduction and the defense against oxidative stress.</p>\n\n<p>Glutaredoxin has been sequenced in a variety of species. On the basis of extensive sequence similarity, it has been proposed [[cite:PUB00005575]] that Vaccinia virus protein O2L is most probably a glutaredoxin. Finally, it must be noted that Bacteriophage T4 thioredoxin seems also to be evolutionary related. In position 5 of the pattern T4 thioredoxin has Val instead of Pro.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This subfamily of bacterial glutaredoxins (GRX) includes Escherichia coli Grx1 (GrxC1) and Grx3 (GrxC).
