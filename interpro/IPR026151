{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The maspardin protein (Mast syndrome, spastic paraplegia, autosomal recessive with dementia) is a member of the AB hydrolase superfamily that has been shown to localise to intracellular endosomal/trans-Golgi transportation vesicles and may function in protein transport and sorting [[cite:PUB00060125]]. The protein has also been shown to interact with CD4, and may play a role as a negative regulatory factor in CD4-dependent T-cell activation [[cite:PUB00060125]]. Although sequence alignments show maspardin to be a member of the AB hydrolase superfamily, they also show it to lack the nucleophile-acid-histidine triad required for catalytic function, suggesting that maspardin is unlikely to function as an enzyme [[cite:PUB00060126]]. Defects in the maspardin gene are the cause of spastic paraplegia autosomal recessive type 21 (SPG21), also known as Mast syndrome. Mast syndrome is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a slow, gradual, progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs [[cite:PUB00060126]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15913" "ACID CLUSTER PROTEIN 33"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Maspardin", "short" "Maspardin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1230, "taxa" 5108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2724, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1836}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026151", :literature {"PUB00060125" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zeitlmann L" "Sirim P" "Kremmer E" "Kolanus W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
