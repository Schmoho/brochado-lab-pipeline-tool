{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents RNA guanine-N7 methyltransferase activating subunit (RAMAC; also known as RNMT-activating mini protein, RAM), which is an essential component of the mRNA-capping methyltransferase RNMT:RAMAC complex required for mRNA cap methylation [[cite:PUB00058118], [cite:PUB00090973]]. RAM consists of an N-terminal RNMT-activating domain and a C-terminal RNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00058118]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In eukaryotes, the 7-methylguanosine cap added to the 5' end of mRNA is required for efficient gene expression. In mammals, methylation of the guanosine cap requires RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase) [[cite:PUB00058118]]. The interaction between RNMT and RAM enhances the mRNA binding capacity and cap methyltransferase activity [[cite:PUB00058118]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48168" "RNA GUANINE-7 METHYLTRANSFERASE-ACTIVATING SUBUNIT-LIKE (PSEUDOGENE)-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF15320" "mRNA cap methylation, RNMT-activating mini protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA guanine-N7 methyltransferase activating subunit", "short" "RAMAC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 826, "taxa" 3313, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1197, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1173, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 803}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028271", :literature {"PUB00058118" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis T" "Dunn S" "Bounds R" "Cowling VH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
