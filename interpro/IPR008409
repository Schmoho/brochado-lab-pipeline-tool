{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family are involved in mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00063011]]. This family includes pre-mRNA-splicing factor SPF27, SNT309 and Cwf7. In humans, SPF27 is a component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. It may have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex [[cite:PUB00063012]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05700" "Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2)"}, "panther" {"PTHR13296" "BCAS2 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SPF27", "short" "SPF27"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 48, "proteomes" 2472, "taxa" 8406, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4086, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2642}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008409", :literature {"PUB00063011" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Palma K" "Zhao Q" "Cheng YT" "Bi D" "Monaghan J" "Cheng W" "Zhang Y" "Li X."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1559607", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Regulation of plant innate immunity by three proteins in a complex conserved across the plant and animal kingdoms.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1484-93", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17575050}, "PUB00063012" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Grote M" "Wolf E" "Will CL" "Lemm I" "Agafonov DE" "Schomburg A" "Fischle W" "Urlaub H" "Luhrmann R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
