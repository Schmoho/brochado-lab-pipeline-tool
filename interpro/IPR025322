{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Pathogen and abiotic stress response, cadmium tolerance, disordered region-containing (PADRE) domain, which is specifically found in plants. PADRE typically occurs in small single-domain proteins with a bipartite architecture. PADRE contains conserved sequence motifs at the N-terminal, and its C-terminal includes an intrinsically disordered region with multiple phosphorylation sites. This domain is associated with plant defense upon diverse stress stimulus and has a role in disease resistance to fungi [[cite:PUB00098607]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14009" "PADRE domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PADRE domain", "short" "PADRE_dom"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 132, "proteomes" 250, "taxa" 1008, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14258, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8379}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025322", :literature {"PUB00098607" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Didelon M" "Khafif M" "Godiard L" "Barbacci A" "Raffaele S."], "ISO_journal" "Front Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Genet", "title" "Patterns of Sequence and Expression Diversification Associate Members of the <i>PADRE</i> Gene Family With Response to Fungal Pathogens.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "491", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32547597}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025322", "name" "PADRE domain", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 172, "alignment:full" 8210}}}
