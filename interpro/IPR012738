{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a set of known and predicted TetR-like transcriptional regulators associated with operons encoding PEP-dependent dihydroxyacteone  (Dha) kinases. The Lactococcus lactis DhaS protein has been shown to interact with the Dha-binding protein DhaQ to form a stable complex [[cite:PUB00036010]]. In the presence of Dha this complex activates transcription of the Dha kinase operon, leading to the utilisation of this substrate. Thus, unlike most TetR-like regulators, DhaS acts as an activator of gene expression rather than a repressor. The DhaS protein is composed of two monomers which fold into a wedge-shaped homodimer.  Each monomer is composed of nine Î± helices and is divided into two domains: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain with a typical TetR fold, and a core domain involved in dimerisation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2iu5", "name" "Dihydroxyacetone kinase operon activator DhaS"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02366" "dihydroxyacetone kinase transcriptional activator DhaS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription regulator DhaS", "short" "Tscrpt_reg_DhaS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 156, "taxa" 764, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 767, "sets" 0, "proteins" 767, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 566}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012738", :literature {"PUB00036010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Christen S" "Srinivas A" "Bahler P" "Zeller A" "Pridmore D" "Bieniossek C" "Baumann U" "Erni B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
