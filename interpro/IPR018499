{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tetraspanins are a distinct family of proteins, containing four transmembrane domains: a small outer loop (EC1), a larger outer loop (EC2), a small inner loop (IL) and short cytoplasmic tails. They contain characteristic structural features, including 4-6 conserved extracellular cysteine residues, and polar residues within transmembrane domains. A fundamental role of tetraspanins appears to be organizing other proteins into a network of multimolecular membrane microdomains, sometimes called the 'tetraspanin web'.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents tetraspanin proteins. It also recognises a number of peripherins. These are related retinal-specific members of the tetraspanin family which are located at the rims of the photoreceptor disks, where they may act jointly in disk morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00004308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008952", "name" "Tetraspanin, EC2 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19282" "TETRASPANIN"}, "pfam" {"PF00335" "Tetraspanin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetraspanin/Peripherin", "short" "Tetraspanin/Peripherin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 588, "proteomes" 1842, "taxa" 7298, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61825, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39901}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018499", :literature {"PUB00004308" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Bascom RA" "Manara S" "Collins L" "Molday RS" "Kalnins VI" "McInnes RR."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0896-6273(92)90137-3", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Cloning of the cDNA for a novel photoreceptor membrane protein (rom-1) identifies a disk rim protein family implicated in human retinopathies.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "1171-84", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1610568}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018499", "name" "Tetraspanin/Peripherin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000301", "name" "Tetraspanin, animals", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR000830", "name" "Peripherin/rom-1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044991", "name" "Tetraspani, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 110, "alignment:full" 41874}}}
