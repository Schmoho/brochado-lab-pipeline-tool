{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This subfamily belongs to bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein family 3. In that family, most members are ABC transporter periplasmic substrate-binding proteins. However, members of the present subfamily are orphans, in the sense of being adjacent to neither ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins or permease subunits. Instead, most members are encoded next to the two signature proteins of the proposed Glycine-Rich Repeat Modification (GRRM) system, a radical SAM/SPASM protein GrrM ([interpro:IPR026357]) and the Gly-rich repeat protein itself GrrA ([interpro:IPR026356]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04262" "extracellular substrate binding-like orphan protein GrrP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Substrate-binding orphan protein, GRRM family", "short" "Orph_peri_GRRM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 65, "taxa" 503, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 395, "sets" 0, "proteins" 395, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 328}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1037"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026358", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026358", "name" "Substrate-binding orphan protein, GRRM family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
