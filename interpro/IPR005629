{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the beta-glucan synthesis-associated proteins SKN1, KRE6 and Sbg1. Beta1,6-Glucan is a key component of the yeast cell wall, interconnecting cell wall proteins, beta1,3-glucan, and chitin. SKN1 and KRE6 show similarities to glycoside hydrolase family 16 glycoside hydrolases, suggesting that they are glycosyl hydrolases or transglycosylases [[cite:PUB00016652]]. Loss of KRE6 shows reduced levels of both beta-1,3-glucan and beta-1,6-glucan synthesis, while loss of SKN1 affects sphingolipid biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00095439]], being related with the synthesis and anchorage of cell wall proteins of glucan polymers of the yeast cell wall, although they play redundant roles [[cite:PUB00095438]]. SKN1, KRE6 and Sbg1 share the SKN1 domain, which is conserved in SKN1 and KRE6 proteins of many fungal species. Sbg1 is an integral membrane protein essential for contractile-ring constriction and septum formation during cytokinesis, which interacts with the conserved beta-glucan synthase Bgs1 and regulates its protein levels and localisation [[cite:PUB00095438], [cite:PUB00095437]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02180" "Saccharomyces cerevisiae KRE6 and related glucanses, member of glycosyl hydrolase family 16"}, "panther" {"PTHR31361" "BETA-GLUCAN SYNTHESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KRE6-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03935" "Beta-glucan synthesis-associated protein SKN1/KRE6/Sbg1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-glucan synthesis-associated protein Skn1/Kre6/Sbg1", "short" "Skn1/Kre6/Sbg1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 140, "proteomes" 977, "taxa" 3016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5852, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5405, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3388}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005629", :literature {"PUB00016652" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Montijn RC" "Vink E" "Muller WH" "Verkleij AJ" "Van Den Ende H" "Henrissat B" "Klis FM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
