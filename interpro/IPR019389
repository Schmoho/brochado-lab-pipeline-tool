{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents selenoprotein T (SelT), which is conserved from plants to humans. SelT is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum through a hydrophobic domain. The protein binds to UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein, which is known to be involved in the quality control of protein folding [[cite:PUB00044486], [cite:PUB00053378]]. Selenium (Se) plays an essential role in cell survival and most of the effects of Se are probably mediated by selenoproteins, including selenoprotein T. SelT may have thioredoxin reductase-like oxidoreductase activity and it may have a role in PACAP signaling during PC12 cell differentiation [[cite:PUB00044487], [cite:PUB00053379]]. SelT protects dopaminergic neurons against oxidative stress and cell death [[cite:PUB00106851]] and in fibroblasts, it plays a role in anchorage and redox regulation [[cite:PUB00106853]]. In pancreatic islets, it is involved in the control of glucose homeostasis, contributes to prolonged ADCYAP1/PACAP-induced insulin secretion [[cite:PUB00106852]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13544" "SELENOPROTEIN T"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenoprotein T", "short" "Selenoprotein_T"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1312, "taxa" 5385, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2775, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2775, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1830}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
