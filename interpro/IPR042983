{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PKDCC (also known as vertebrate lonesome kinase, VLK) is a secreted tyrosine kinase that mediates phosphorylation of extracellular proteins and endogenous proteins in the secretory pathway, which is essential for patterning at organogenesis stages [[cite:PUB00093546]]. It contains an N-terminal signal sequence and a divergent C-terminal catalytic protein kinase-like domain that replaces the canonical kinase 'DFG' and 'HRD' motifs with alternate, yet functional residues [[cite:PUB00093549]]. It has been shown to interact with Gli3 to regulate chondrocyte differentiation during mouse long bone development [[cite:PUB00093547]].</p>\n\n<p>In Xenopus, there are two members of the PKDCC family, Pkdcc1 and Pkdcc2.
