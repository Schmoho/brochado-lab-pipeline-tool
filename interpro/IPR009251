{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents several alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase ([ec:2.4.99]) proteins, most of which are found in the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. Sialyltransferases transfer a sialic acid moiety from cytidine-5'-monophospho-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) to terminal positions of various key glycoconjugates, which play critical roles in cell recognition and adherence [[cite:PUB00030744]]. The structure of Cst-II alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase from C. jejuni consists of a 3-layer α/β/α topology. Cst-II catalytic mechanism involves an essential histidine (general base) and two tyrosine residues (coordination of the phosphate leaving group) to carry out substrate binding and glycosyl transfer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2x61", "name" "Crystal structure of the sialyltransferase CST-II in complex with trisaccharide acceptor and CMP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036715", "name" "Alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06002" "Alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (CST-I)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase", "short" "A-2_3-sialyltransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 227, "sets" 0, "proteins" 220, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 190}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009251", :literature {"PUB00030744" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Chiu CP" "Watts AG" "Lairson LL" "Gilbert M" "Lim D" "Wakarchuk WW" "Withers SG" "Strynadka NC."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
