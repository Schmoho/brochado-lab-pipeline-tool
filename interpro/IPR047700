{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents NrtS from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and similar bacterial sequences. It includes both NrtS1 and NrtS2 proteins, which share significant sequence similarity and conserved motifs. These proteins are encoded by two neighboring genes on Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 genome. NrtS1 and NrtS2 form a heteromeric transporter complex that was shown to transport nitrite as well as nitrate [[cite:PUB00105538]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038050" "nitrate/nitrite transporter NrtS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrate/nitrite transporter NrtS-like", "short" "NrtS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 233, "taxa" 1854, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1333, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1330, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 945}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047700", :literature {"PUB00105538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Maeda SI" "Aoba R" "Nishino Y" "Omata T."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "A Novel Bacterial Nitrate Transporter Composed of Small Transmembrane Proteins.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "2180-2192", "volume" "60", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31198965}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047700", "name" "Nitrate/nitrite transporter NrtS-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
