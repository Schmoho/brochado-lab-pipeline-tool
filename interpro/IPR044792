TAR1 might be involved in regulation of respiratory metabolism expression as it is induced under respiratory conditions to maintain oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Its levels in mitochondria are tightly controlled and usually low. It is down-regulated to manage oxidative stress when respiration is defective  [[cite:PUB00097085]].
