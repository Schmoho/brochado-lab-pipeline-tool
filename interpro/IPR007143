{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) complexes form the machinery driving protein sorting from endosomes to lysosomes. ESCRT complexes are central to receptor down-regulation, lysosome biogenesis, and budding of HIV. Yeast ESCRT-I consists of three protein subunits, Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37. In humans, ESCRT-I comprises TSG101, VPS28, and one of four potential human VPS37 homologues. The main role of ESCRT-I is to recognise ubiquitinated cargo via the UEV domain of the VPS23/TSG101 subunit. The assembly of the ESCRT-I complex is directed by the C-terminal steadiness box (SB) of VPS23, the N-terminal half of VPS28, and the C-terminal half of VPS37. The structure is primarily composed of three long, parallel helical hairpins, each corresponding to a different subunit. The additional domains and motifs extending beyond the core serve as gripping tools for ESCRT-I critical functions [[cite:PUB00039953], [cite:PUB00040552]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2j9u", "name" "2 Angstrom X-ray structure of the yeast ESCRT-I Vps28 C-terminus in complex with the NZF-N domain from ESCRT-II"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037206", "name" "VPS28, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038358", "name" "VPS28, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12937" "VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 28, ISOFORM 2 VPS28"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017535" "ESCRT-1 complex, Vps28 subunit"}, "pfam" {"PF03997" "VPS28 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated Vps28", "short" "Vps28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 72, "proteomes" 2324, "taxa" 8206, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4210, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2670}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007143", :literature {"PUB00039953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Teo H" "Gill DJ" "Sun J" "Perisic O" "Veprintsev DB" "Vallis Y" "Emr SD" "Williams RL."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.047", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "ESCRT-I core and ESCRT-II GLUE domain structures reveal role for GLUE in linking to ESCRT-I and membranes.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "99-111", "volume" "125", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16615893}, "PUB00040552" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kostelansky MS" "Sun J" "Lee S" "Kim J" "Ghirlando R" "Hierro A" "Emr SD" "Hurley JH."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.049", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural and functional organization of the ESCRT-I trafficking complex.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "113-26", "volume" "125", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16615894}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0032509", "name" "endosome transport via multivesicular body sorting pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000813", "name" "ESCRT I complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007143", "name" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated Vps28", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 95, "alignment:full" 2363}}}
