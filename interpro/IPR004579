{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins includes Rad10 from budding yeasts, Swi10 from fission yeasts and ERCC-1 from animals and plants. All proteins in this family for which functions are known are components in a multiprotein endonuclease complex (usually made up of Rad1 and Rad10 homologues). This complex is used primarily for nucleotide excision repair but also for some aspects of recombination repair.</p>\n\n<p>In budding yeast, Rad10 works as a heterodimer with Rad1, and is involved in nucleotide excision repair of DNA damaged with UV light, bulky adducts or cross-linking agents. The complex forms an endonuclease which specifically degrades single-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00075513]].</p>\n\n<p>ERCC1 and XPF (xeroderma pigmentosum group F-complementing protein) are two structure-specific endonucleases of a class of seven containing an ERCC4 domain. Together they form an obligate complex that functions primarily in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a versatile pathway able to detect and remove a variety of DNA lesions induced by UV light and environmental carcinogens, and secondarily in DNA inter-strand cross-link repair and telomere maintenance. This domain in fact binds simultaneously to both XPF and single-stranded DNA; this ternary complex explains the important role of Ercc1 in targeting its catalytic XPF partner to the NER pre-incision complex [[cite:PUB00044709]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2a1i", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Central Domain of Human ERCC1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12749" "EXCISION REPAIR CROSS-COMPLEMENTING 1 ERCC1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ERCC1/RAD10/SWI10 family", "short" "ERCC1/RAD10/SWI10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2294, "taxa" 8023, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4090, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4090, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2645}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004579", :literature {"PUB00044709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Tripsianes K" "Folkers GE" "Zheng C" "Das D" "Grinstead JS" "Kaptein R" "Boelens R."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm503", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Analysis of the XPA and ssDNA-binding surfaces on the central domain of human ERCC1 reveals evidence for subfunctionalization.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "5789-98", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17720715}, "PUB00075513" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Guzder SN" "Sommers CH" "Prakash L" "Prakash S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
