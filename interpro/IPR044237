{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes ATXR2 from Arabidopsis. ATXR2 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the accumulation of histone H3 proteins that are trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus formation on callus-inducing medium. It promotes early stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) genes and acts as a regulator of de novo root organogenesis [[cite:PUB00095534], [cite:PUB00095533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47436" "HISTONE-LYSINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE ATXR2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase ATXR2-like", "short" "ATXR2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 361, "taxa" 1482, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 988, "sets" 0, "proteins" 988, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 667}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
