{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A large group of bacterial exotoxins are referred to as \"A/B toxins\", essentially because they are formed from two subunits. The \"A\" subunit possesses enzyme activity, and is transferred to the host cell following a conformational change in the membrane-bound transport \"B\" subunit [[cite:PUB00006643]].</p>\n\n<p>Clostridial species are one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastro-intestinal illnesses. They are Gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur naturally in the soil [[cite:PUB00006643]]. Included in the family are: Clostridium botulinum, which produces one of the most potent toxins in existence; Clostridium tetani, causative agent of tetanus; and Clostridium perfringens, commonly found in wound infections and diarrhoea cases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01390" "BINARYTOXINA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Binary exotoxin A, clostridial type", "short" "Binary_toxinA_clost-typ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 87, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 116, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 80}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016013", :literature {"PUB00006643" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Perelle S" "Gibert M" "Boquet P" "Popoff MR."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
