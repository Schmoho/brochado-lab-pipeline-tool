{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of zinc finger proteins, including MBS1/2 from Arabidopsis and ZNF706 from animals. MBS1/2 are required for induction of singlet oxygen-dependent gene expression and is involved in ROS signalling [[cite:PUB00098323]]. ZNF706 may act as a transcription repressor involved in the exit of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from self-renewal [[cite:PUB00084306]].
