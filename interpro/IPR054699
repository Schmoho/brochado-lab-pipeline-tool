{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are radical SAM enzymes with an N-terminal apparent B12-binding domain. Some members of the family have Cys-Cys motif about 10 amino acids before the C-terminal, but the majority of the family are selenoproteins with the second Cys replaced by selenocysteine, in a strongly conserved motif W[YF]C[CU]AEP. The proximity of the selenocysteine-encoding TGA codon to the C-terminal may have impeded recognition of this novel family of selenoproteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040546" "CUAEP/CCAEP-tail radical SAM (seleno)protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CUAEP/CCAEP-tail radical SAM protein", "short" "rSAM_CUAEP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 53, "taxa" 589, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 740, "sets" 0, "proteins" 740, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 544}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054699", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054699", "name" "CUAEP/CCAEP-tail radical SAM protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
