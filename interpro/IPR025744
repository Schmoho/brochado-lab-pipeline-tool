{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of ribosomally synthesised peptides from Streptomyces species and related to microviridin and marinostatin. They are usually in the gene neighbourhood of one or more RimK-like ATP-grasp. The gene-context suggests that it is further modified by the ATP-grasp. The peptide is predicted to function in a defensive or developmental role, or as an antibiotic [[cite:PUB00057486]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14404" "Ribosomally synthesized peptide in Streptomyces species"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomally synthesised peptide in Streptomyces", "short" "Rbsml_synth_pep_Strp"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 199, "taxa" 605, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 612, "sets" 0, "proteins" 612, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 412}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1000", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1000"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025744", :literature {"PUB00057486" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Abhiman S" "Maxwell Burroughs A" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b917682a", "medline_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "title" "Amidoligases with ATP-grasp, glutamine synthetase-like and acetyltransferase-like domains: synthesis of novel metabolites and peptide modifications of proteins.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1636-60", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20023723}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025744", "name" "Ribosomally synthesised peptide in Streptomyces", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 223}}}
