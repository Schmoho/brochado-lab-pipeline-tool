{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3-dehydroquinate dehydratase ([ec:4.2.1.10]), or dehydroquinase, catalyzes the conversion of 3-dehydroquinate into 3-dehydroshikimate. It is the third step in the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids from chorismate. Two classes of dehydroquinases exist, known as types I and II. Class-II enzymes are homododecameric enzymes of about 17kDa. They are found in some bacteria such as actinomycetales [[cite:PUB00003743], [cite:PUB00003855]] and some fungi where they act in a catabolic pathway that allows the use of quinic acid as a carbon source.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hsa", "name" "The crystal structure of type II Dehydroquinase from Butyrivibrio crossotus DSM 2876"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036441", "name" "Dehydroquinase, class II superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00466" "DHQase_II"}, "hamap" {"MF_00169" "3-dehydroquinate dehydratase [aroQ]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001399" "3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, type II"}, "panther" {"PTHR21272" "CATABOLIC 3-DEHYDROQUINASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01088" "3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, type II"}, "pfam" {"PF01220" "Dehydroquinase class II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dehydroquinase, class II", "short" "DHquinase_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 78, "domain_architectures" 64, "proteomes" 8310, "taxa" 30073, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 36576, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28048}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00789", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00789"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
