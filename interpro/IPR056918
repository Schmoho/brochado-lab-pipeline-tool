{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents uncharacterised bacterial proteins. They are predicted as integral membrane proteins composed of three integral membrane α-helices. Structure prediction suggests that these proteins form an octameric complex ([swissprot:A0A0D0Q6W1]) ipTM = 0.81 pTM = 0.82). This complex contains a central pore. The predicted complex has a flat face on the predicted extracellular face that suggests it may form a complex with another as yet unidentified partner. The α-helices could project into the cytoplasm.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24838" "Octameric membrane protein family (8xMP)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Octameric membrane protein", "short" "8xMP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 317, "taxa" 2582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1563, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1563, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1172}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056918", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056918", "name" "Octameric membrane protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 212, "alignment:full" 328}}}
