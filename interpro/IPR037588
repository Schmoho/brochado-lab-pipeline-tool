{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents target of rapamycin complex subunit LST8 (MLST8 or GbetaL), a component of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, complexes that regulate cell growth in response to nutrients.  The mTORC1 complex consists of MTOR, MLST8, RPTOR, AKT1S1/PRAS40 and DEPTOR.  The mTORC2 complex contains MTOR, MLST8, PRR5, RICTOR, MAPKAP1 and DEPTOR [[cite:PUB00015261]].  In mTORC1, MLST8 interacts directly with MTOR and enhances its kinase activity [[cite:PUB00087296]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes the target of rapamycin complex subunit wat1 (pop3 or wat1) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is also a component of yeast TORC1 and TORC2 complexes. The subunits of TORC1 in fission yeasts are known as mip1, pop3/wat1, tco89, toc1 and tor2; and the subunits of the TORC2 complex are bit61, pop3/wat1, sin1, ste20 and tor1 [[cite:PUB00044236]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19842" "G BETA-LIKE PROTEIN GBL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Target of rapamycin complex subunit LST8", "short" "MLST8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2450, "taxa" 8674, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5320, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5320, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3325}, "pathways" 99}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2030", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2030"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037588", :literature {"PUB00015261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Loewith R" "Jacinto E" "Wullschleger S" "Lorberg A" "Crespo JL" "Bonenfant D" "Oppliger W" "Jenoe P" "Hall MN."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
