{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of plant regulatory factors that bind to G-box or G-box-like motifs (5'-CCACGTGG-3') in gene promoters. They are involved in responses to fungal pathogen infection and abiotic stresses. G-box and G-box-like motifs are cis-acting elements defined in promoters of certain plant genes which are regulated by such diverse stimuli as light-induction or hormone control. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the G-group includes G-box-binding factors 1-3 and bZIP transcription factors 16/68 which have a conserved protein structure containing a highly homological basic region and a proline-rich domain in the N-terminal region [[cite:PUB00097167], [cite:PUB00045227]]. Transcription factor HBP-1a and bZIP transcription factors 1-A/B/D from wheat are also included in this entry (Zhang Y. et al. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 73:88-94(2009)).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45967" "G-BOX-BINDING FACTOR 3-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G-box-binding factor-like", "short" "GBF-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 285, "taxa" 1226, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4240, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2592}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044827", :literature {"PUB00045227" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Shen H" "Cao K" "Wang X."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMB Rep", "title" "AtbZIP16 and AtbZIP68, two new members of GBFs, can interact with other G group bZIPs in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "132-8", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18315949}, "PUB00097167" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Shaikhali J" "Noren L" "de Dios Barajas-Lopez J" "Srivastava V" "Konig J" "Sauer UH" "Wingsle G" "Dietz KJ" "Strand A."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Redox-mediated mechanisms regulate DNA binding activity of the G-group of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "27510-25", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22718771}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0043565", "name" "sequence-specific DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044827", "name" "G-box-binding factor-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
