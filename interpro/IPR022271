{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ApoD-type lipocalins, including retinol-binding protein 4 as well as other retinol-binding proteins. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is mainly associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and appears to be able to transport a variety of ligands in a number of different contexts [[cite:PUB00034502]]. Insect Lazarillo is an homologue of ApoD [[cite:PUB00087485]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The lipocalins are a diverse, interesting, yet poorly understood family of proteins composed, in the main, of extracellular ligand-binding proteins displaying high specificity for small hydrophobic molecules [[cite:PUB00005094]]. Functions of these proteins include transport of nutrients, control of cell regulation, pheromone transport, cryptic colouration, and the enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandins. For example, retinol-binding protein 4 transfers retinol from the stores in the liver to peripheral tissues [[cite:PUB00083135]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structures of several lipocalins have been solved and show a novel 8-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel fold well conserved within the family. Sequence similarity within the family is at a much lower level and would seem to be restricted to conserved disulphides and 3 motifs, which form a juxtaposed cluster that may act as a common cell surface receptor site [[cite:PUB00000205], [cite:PUB00005013]]. By contrast, at the more variable end of the fold are found an internal ligand binding site and a putative surface for the formation of macromolecular complexes [[cite:PUB00003448]]. The anti-parallel β-barrel fold is also exploited by the fatty acid-binding proteins, which function similarly by binding small hydrophobic molecules. Similarity at the sequence level, however, is less obvious, being confined to a single short N-terminal motif.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1h91", "name" "The crystal structure of lobster apocrustacyanin A1 using softer X-rays."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012674", "name" "Calycin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036893" "Lipocalin, ApoD type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipocalin, ApoD type", "short" "Lipocalin_ApoD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 70, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2964, "taxa" 14121, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16991, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16841, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12290}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
