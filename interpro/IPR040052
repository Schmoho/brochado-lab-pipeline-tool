{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes proteins with a G-patch domain and a RNA recognition motif domain, including mammalian splicing factor 45 (SPF45; also known as RNA-binding motif protein 17 or RBM17) and plant DNA-damage-repair/toleration protein DRT111 (also known as RSN2). SPF45 is an mRNA spliceosomal protein that is required for alternative splicing and the utilization of cryptic splice sites.  The beta-110 mutation in the haemoglobin beta causes activation of a cryptic 3' splice site that is the cause of human beta-thalassemia (sickle-cell anemia) [[cite:PUB00090465]]. DRT111 is also required for pre-mRNA splicing, particularly the mRNA for receptor-like kinase SNC4, which activates the defence response to microbial pathogens in plants [[cite:PUB00090466]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hip", "name" "Structure of SPF45 UHM bound to HIV-1 Rev ULM"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13288" "SPLICING FACTOR 45 SPF45"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF031066" "Splicing factor, SPF45 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Splicing factor 45", "short" "RBM17"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2341, "taxa" 8080, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4378, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4281, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2783}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040052", :literature {"PUB00090465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lallena MJ" "Chalmers KJ" "Llamazares S" "Lamond AI" "Valcarcel J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00730-4", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Splicing regulation at the second catalytic step by Sex-lethal involves 3' splice site recognition by SPF45.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "285-96", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12015979}, "PUB00090466" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zhang Z" "Liu Y" "Ding P" "Li Y" "Kong Q" "Zhang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Plant", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/mp/ssu103", "medline_journal" "Mol Plant", "title" "Splicing of receptor-like kinase-encoding SNC4 and CERK1 is regulated by two conserved splicing factors that are required for plant immunity.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1766-75", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25267732}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045292", "name" "mRNA cis splicing, via spliceosome", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040052", "name" "Splicing factor 45", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
