{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of a group of proteins predominantly found in Firmicutes, including Uncharacterized protein YfhH from Bacillus subtilis and protein GK0453 from Geobacillus kaustophilus.  GK0453 shows two small domains: an helix-turn-helix like motif is found in its N-terminal domain while an SH3-like Î²-barrel like structure is observed its C-terminal region. Its specific function is unknown [[cite:PUB00100670]]. Some of the members of this protein family are annotated as being transcriptional regulators (see [swissprot:Q3EXU7], [swissprot:Q81I96]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sf9", "name" "Crystal Structure of Bacillus subtilis YfhH Protein : Putative Transcriptional Regulator"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036289", "name" "Hypothetical protein YfhH", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08838" "Protein of unknown function (DUF1811)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YfhH-like", "short" "YfhH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 435, "taxa" 1384, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1255, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 960}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014938", :literature {"PUB00100670" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Padmanabhan B" "Nakamura Y" "Antonyuk SV" "Strange RW" "Hasnain SS" "Yokoyama S" "Bessho Y."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun", "title" "Structure of the hypothetical DUF1811-family protein GK0453 from Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "342-5", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23545635}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014938", "name" "YfhH-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 21, "alignment:full" 425}}}
