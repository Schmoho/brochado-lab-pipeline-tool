{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In prokaryotes, the major role of DNA methylation is to protect host DNA against degradation by restriction enzymes. Adenine modification methylases are a large group of enzymes, most of which form so-called 'restriction-modification systems'. Methylation of specific adenine residues is required for both restriction and modification activities. This methylase catalyses the reaction: <reaction>S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA adenine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 6-methylaminopurine</reaction></p>\n\n<p>It recognises the double-stranded sequence 5'-GGATG-3' in one strand and 3'-CATCC-5' in the other, causing specific methylation on the A of both strands. This protects the DNA from cleavage by the FokI endonuclease. The 2 domains of the protein participate in the modification of the two strands.</p>\n\n<p>This group represents a modification methylase (adenine-specific), M.StsI type.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036638" "Modification methylase (adenine-specific), M.StsI type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenine modification methylase, M.StsI-type", "short" "Ade-mod_methylase_MStsI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 618, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 273, "sets" 0, "proteins" 254, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 197}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
