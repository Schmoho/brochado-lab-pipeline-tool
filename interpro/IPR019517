{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ICAP-1 is a serine/threonine-rich protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domains of beta-1 integrins in a highly specific manner, binding to a NPXY sequence motif on the beta-1 integrin. The cytoplasmic domains of integrins are essential for cell adhesion, and the fact that phosphorylation of ICAP-1 by interaction with the cell-matrix implies an important role of ICAP-1 during integrin-dependent cell adhesion [[cite:PUB00044310]]. Over expression of ICAP-1 strongly reduces the integrin-mediated cell spreading on extracellular matrix and inhibits both Cdc42 and Rac1. In addition, ICAP-1 induces release of Cdc42 from cellular membranes and prevents the dissociation of GDP from this GTPase [[cite:PUB00044311]]. An additional function of ICAP-1 is to promote differentiation of osteoprogenitors by supporting their condensation through modulating the integrin high affinity state [[cite:PUB00044312]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4jif", "name" "Co-crystal structure of ICAP1 PTB domain in complex with a KRIT1 peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32055" "INTEGRIN BETA-1-BINDING PROTEIN 1"}, "pfam" {"PF10480" "Beta-1 integrin binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Integrin binding protein, ICAP-1", "short" "Integrin-bd_ICAP-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 715, "taxa" 2505, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1276, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1195, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 823}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019517", :literature {"PUB00044310" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Chang DD" "Wong C" "Smith H" "Liu J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
