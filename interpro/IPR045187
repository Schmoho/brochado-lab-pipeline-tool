{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:7.1.1.9]) [[cite:PUB00000581], [cite:PUB00002253]] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a component of the respiratory chain and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane. The number of polypeptides in the complex ranges from 3-4 (prokaryotes), up to 13 (mammals). In Archaea, a cytochrome-c-type oxidase from Natronobacterium (cytochrome ba3) has been shown to consists of four subunits [[cite:PUB00061601]].</p>\n\n<p>Subunit 2 (CO II) transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to the catalytic subunit 1. It contains two adjacent transmembrane regions in its N terminus and the major part of the protein is exposed to the periplasmic or to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, respectively. CO II provides the substrate-binding site and contains a copper centre called Cu(A), probably the primary acceptor in cytochrome c oxidase. An exception is the corresponding subunit of the cbb3-type oxidase which lacks the copper A redox-centre. Several bacterial CO II have a C-terminal extension that contains a covalently bound haem c.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7coh", "name" "Dimeric Form of Bovine Heart Cytochrome c Oxidase in the Fully Oxidized State"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036257", "name" "Cytochrome C oxidase subunit II, transmembrane domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22888" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE, SUBUNIT II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c/quinol oxidase subunit II", "short" "CcO_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 185, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7579, "taxa" 100710, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 117743, "sets" 0, "proteins" 117743, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 98333}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
