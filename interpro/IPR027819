{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The entry includes Guanine nucleotide exchange factor C9orf72 protein, a component of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, which has guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity [[cite:PUB00085172]] and regulates autophagy [[cite:PUB00085173], [cite:PUB00100251]]. The C9orf72 protein is proposed to be a catalytic component for the exchange of GDP to GTP and promoting autophagosome maturation by converting inactive GDP-bound RAB8A and RAB39B into their active forms [[cite:PUB00085174]].  Defects in the C9orf72 gene are the cause of frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTDALS) which is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. The disorder is caused by a large expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleotide within the first C9orf72 intron located between the first and the second non-coding exons. The expansion leads to the loss of transcription of one of the two transcripts encoding isoform 1 and to the formation of nuclear RNA foci [[cite:PUB00067377]]. This family is found in eukaryotes.</p>\n\n<p>C9orf72 contains the DENN domain, which forms a heart-shaped structure ([pdbe:3TW8]), with the N-terminal residues forming one lobe and the C-terminal residues forming the second one. The tripartite DENN (after differentially expressed in neoplastic versus normal cells) domain is found in several proteins that share common structural features and have been shown to be guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rab GTPases, which are regulators of practically all membrane trafficking events in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00065679], [cite:PUB00100258]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15019" "C9orf72-like protein family"}, "panther" {"PTHR31855" "GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE C9ORF72"}, "profile" {"PS51835" "Tripartite DENN C9ORF72-type domain profile"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine nucleotide exchange factor C9orf72", "short" "C9orf72"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 835, "taxa" 3093, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1509, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1508, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 995}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027819", :literature {"PUB00067377" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["DeJesus-Hernandez M" "Mackenzie IR" "Boeve BF" "Boxer AL" "Baker M" "Rutherford NJ" "Nicholson AM" "Finch NA" "Flynn H" "Adamson J" "Kouri N" "Wojtas A" "Sengdy P" "Hsiung GY" "Karydas A" "Seeley WW" "Josephs KA" "Coppola G" "Geschwind DH" "Wszolek ZK" "Feldman H" "Knopman DS" "Petersen RC" "Miller BL" "Dickson DW" "Boylan KB" "Graff-Radford NR" "Rademakers R."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.011", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in noncoding region of C9ORF72 causes chromosome 9p-linked FTD and ALS.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "245-56", "volume" "72", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21944778}, "PUB00085172" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Jung J" "Nayak A" "Schaeffer V" "Starzetz T" "Kirsch AK" "Muller S" "Dikic I" "Mittelbronn M" "Behrends C."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23063", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Multiplex image-based autophagy RNAi screening identifies SMCR8 as ULK1 kinase activity and gene expression regulator.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28195531}, "PUB00085173" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sullivan PM" "Zhou X" "Robins AM" "Paushter DH" "Kim D" "Smolka MB" "Hu F."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Neuropathol Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-016-0324-5", "medline_journal" "Acta Neuropathol Commun", "title" "The ALS/FTLD associated protein C9orf72 associates with SMCR8 and WDR41 to regulate the autophagy-lysosome pathway.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "51", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27193190}, "PUB00085174" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Sellier C" "Campanari ML" "Julie Corbier C" "Gaucherot A" "Kolb-Cheynel I" "Oulad-Abdelghani M" "Ruffenach F" "Page A" "Ciura S" "Kabashi E" "Charlet-Berguerand N."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201593350", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Loss of C9ORF72 impairs autophagy and synergizes with polyQ Ataxin-2 to induce motor neuron dysfunction and cell death.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1276-97", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27103069}, "PUB00100251" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Tang D" "Sheng J" "Xu L" "Zhan X" "Liu J" "Jiang H" "Shu X" "Liu X" "Zhang T" "Jiang L" "Zhou C" "Li W" "Cheng W" "Li Z" "Wang K" "Lu K" "Yan C" "Qi S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Cryo-EM structure of C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 reveals the role as a GAP for Rab8a and Rab11a.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "9876-9883", "volume" "117", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32303654}, "PUB00100258" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Norpel J" "Cavadini S" "Schenk AD" "Graff-Meyer A" "Hess D" "Seebacher J" "Chao JA" "Bhaskar V."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Structure of the human C9orf72-SMCR8 complex reveals a multivalent protein interaction architecture.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e3001344", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34297726}, "PUB00065679" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Wu X" "Bradley MJ" "Cai Y" "Kummel D" "De La Cruz EM" "Barr FA" "Reinisch KM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
