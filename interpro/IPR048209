{:metadata {:description [{"text" "This entry represents a group of proteins from enterobacterales, including YmiC from Escherichia coli, an uncharacterised predicted protein about 32 amino acids long predicted to be a membrane protein based on conservation across multiple gammaproteobacteria with constant length and hydrophobic character. Expression was verified for a construct with an added C-terminal epitope. Homologues tend to show a pattern of conservative amino acid substitutions. A usual feature is three perfectly invariant Trp residues, and a highly conserved fourth, in a stretch of 19 residues [[cite:PUB00106067]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041484" "small membrane protein YmiC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YmiC-like", "short" "YmiC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 83, "sets" 0, "proteins" 83, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048209", :literature {"PUB00106067" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["VanOrsdel CE" "Kelly JP" "Burke BN" "Lein CD" "Oufiero CE" "Sanchez JF" "Wimmers LE" "Hearn DJ" "Abuikhdair FJ" "Barnhart KR" "Duley ML" "Ernst SEG" "Kenerson BA" "Serafin AJ" "Hemm MR."], "ISO_journal" "Proteomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteomics", "title" "Identifying New Small Proteins in Escherichia coli.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "e1700064", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29645342}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048209", "name" "YmiC-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
