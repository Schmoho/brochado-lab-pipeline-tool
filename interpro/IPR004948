{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of nucleoside-triphosphatases which have activity towards ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP and UTP and may hydrolyse nucleoside diphosphates with lower efficiency [[cite:PUB00041591]]. It includes proteins from bacteria to human, and the function was determined first in a hyperthermophilic bacterium to be an NTPase [[cite:PUB00055956]]. The structure of one member-sequence represents a variation of the RecA fold, and implies that the function might be that of a DNA/RNA modifying enzyme [[cite:PUB00032635]]. The sequence carries both a Walker A and Walker B motif which together are characteristic of ATPases or GTPases. The protein exhibits an increased expression profile in human liver cholangiocarcinoma when compared to normal tissue [[cite:PUB00041591]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ye8", "name" "Crystal Structure of THEP1 from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43146" "CANCER-RELATED NUCLEOSIDE-TRIPHOSPHATASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00796" "Nucleoside-triphosphatase <locus_tag>"}, "pfam" {"PF03266" "NTPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoside-triphosphatase, THEP1 type", "short" "Nuc-triphosphatase_THEP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 74, "proteomes" 1585, "taxa" 8055, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6771, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6710, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5033}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1635", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1635"} {"accession" "GenProp1617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1617"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
