{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains proteins involved in the first step of pre-mRNA splicing to remove introns. Splicing is performed by the spliceosome, which is a complex of snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 and proteins such as pre-mRNA-processing factor 19 (Prp19). The yeast protein Cwc2 contains motifs known to bind RNA, a zinc finger and an RNA recognition motif. Because mutations in the gene are lethal and lead to accumulation of pre-mRNA, and reduced levels of U1, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and U4/U6 snRNA complex levels, Cwc2 has been proposed to link the Prp19 complex to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00082819]]. Because Cwc2 is at the spliceosome catalytic centre, it induces an active conformation of the spliceosome's catalytic RNA elements [[cite:PUB00089039]]. Cwc2 is a component of the CWC complex [[cite:PUB00008533]]. The human homologue, known as RBM22 [[cite:PUB00089039]], also translocates the protein SLU7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or vice versa in the case of the calcium-binding protein PDCD6 [[cite:PUB00089042]].</p>\n\n<p>Also included in this entry is the pre-mRNA-splicing factor Slt11 (also known as Ecm2) [[cite:PUB00089043]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3u1l", "name" "Structure of the mRNA splicing complex component Cwc2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14089" "PRE-MRNA-SPLICING FACTOR RBM22"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor Cwc2/Slt11", "short" "Cwc2/Slt11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 58, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2632, "taxa" 8853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9178, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9178, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5956}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039171", :literature {"PUB00008533" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Ohi MD" "Link AJ" "Ren L" "Jennings JL" "McDonald WH" "Gould KL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
