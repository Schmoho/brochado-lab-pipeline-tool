They show considerable diversity at the sequence level, on the basis of which they can be separated into distinct groups [[cite:PUB00053635]]. The term clan can be used to describe the GPCRs, as they embrace a group of families for which there are indications of evolutionary relationship, but between which there is no statistically significant similarity in sequence [[cite:PUB00004961]]. The currently known clan members include rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Class A, GPCRA), secretin-like GPCRs (Class B, GPCRB), metabotropic glutamate receptor family (Class C, GPCRC), fungal mating pheromone receptors (Class D, GPCRD), cAMP receptors (Class E, GPCRE) and frizzled/smoothened (Class F, GPCRF) [[cite:PUB00004961], [cite:PUB00063577], [cite:PUB00063578], [cite:PUB00063579], [cite:PUB00063580]].  GPCRs are major drug targets, and are consequently the subject of considerable research interest. It has been reported that the repertoire of GPCRs for endogenous ligands consists of approximately 400 receptors in humans and mice [[cite:PUB00053635]]. Most GPCRs are identified on the basis of their DNA sequences, rather than the ligand they bind, those that are unmatched to known natural ligands are designated by as orphan GPCRs, or unclassified GPCRs [[cite:PUB00063816]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has only 14 types of chemosensory neuron, yet is able to sense and respond to several hundred different chemicals because each neuron detects several stimuli [[cite:PUB00007387]]. Chemoperception is one of the central senses of soil nematodes like C. elegans which are otherwise 'blind' and 'deaf' [[cite:PUB00044128]]. Chemoreception in C. elegans is mediated by members of the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor class (7TM GPCRs). More than 1300 potential chemoreceptor genes have been identified in C. elegans, which are generally prefixed sr for serpentine receptor. The receptor superfamilies include Sra (Sra, Srb, Srab, Sre), Str (Srh, Str, Sri, Srd, Srj, Srm, Srn) and Srg (Srx, Srt, Srg, Sru, Srv, Srxa), as well as the families Srw, Srz, Srbc, Srsx and Srr [[cite:PUB00000924], [cite:PUB00044128], [cite:PUB00044129]].
