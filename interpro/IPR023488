{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MarR-type HTH domain is a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain of about 135 amino acids present in transcription regulators of the MarR/SlyA family, involved in the development of antibiotic resistance. The MarR family of transcription regulators is named after Escherichia coli MarR, a repressor of genes which activate the multiple antibiotic resistance and oxidative stress regulons, and after slyA from Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli, a transcription regulator that is required for virulence and survival in the macrophage environment. Regulators with the MarR-type HTH domain are present in bacteria and archaea and control a variety of biological functions, including resistance to multiple antibiotics, household disinfectants, organic solvents, oxidative stress agents and regulation of the virulence factor synthesis in pathogens of humans and plants. Many of the MarR-like regulators respond to aromatic compounds [[cite:PUB00015407], [cite:PUB00015408], [cite:PUB00015410]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structures of MarR, MexR and SlyA have been determined and show a winged HTH DNA-binding core flanked by helices involved in dimerisation. The DNA-binding domains are ascribed to the superfamily of winged helix proteins, containing a three (four)-helix (H) bundle and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (B) in the topology: H1-(H1')-H2-B1-H3-H4-B2-B3-H5-H6. Helices 3 and 4 comprise the helix-turn-helix motif and the β-sheet is called the wing. Helix 4 is termed the recognition helix, like in other HTHs where it binds the DNA major groove. The helices 1, 5 and 6 are involved in dimerisation, as most MarR-like transcription regulators form dimers [[cite:PUB00015410], [cite:PUB00015409]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The proteins in this entry are all of the hpr type found in bacteria and function as negative regulators of protease production and sporulation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01911" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator Hpr [hpr]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator Hpr", "short" "HTH_tscrpt_reg_Hpr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 119, "taxa" 554, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 527, "sets" 0, "proteins" 527, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 378}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023488", :literature {"PUB00015407" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Alekshun MN" "Levy SB."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Microbiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0966-842X(99)01589-9", "medline_journal" "Trends Microbiol", "title" "The mar regulon: multiple resistance to antibiotics and other toxic chemicals.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "410-3", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10498949}, "PUB00015408" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Egland PG" "Harwood CS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
