{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many peptide-modifying radical SAM enzymes have two 4Fe4S-binding regions, an N-terminal one recognised by [interpro:IPR007197] and a C-terminal one recognised by [interpro:IPR023885]. Members of this protein family occur in cassettes with such a radical SAM family [interpro:IPR026407] and with a peptide modification target [interpro:IPR026408]. Surprisingly, members of this family show full-length homology to each other, with several scoring at least borderline hits to both [interpro:IPR007197] and [interpro:IPR023885], and yet differ in the presence/absence of a signature CX(3)CX(2)CX(9)C motif. Instead, members are best-conserved in the [interpro:IPR023885]-like C-terminal region. Therefore, this protein family is designated a quasi-radical-SAM protein, which likely works in partnership with a  [interpro:IPR026407] family protein [[cite:PUB00055953]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04150" "TIGR04150 pseudo-rSAM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pseudo-rSAM protein, GG-Bacteroidales system", "short" "Pseudo_rSAM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 157, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 188, "sets" 0, "proteins" 188, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 148}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0984", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0984"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026418", :literature {"PUB00055953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Basu MK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
