{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme family shares sequence similarity and a requirement for a molydenum cofactor as the only prosthetic group. The form of the cofactor is a single molybdenum atom coordinated by two molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide molecules. Members of the family include biotin sulphoxide reductase, dimethylsulphoxide reductase, and trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase, although a single member may show all those activities and related activities; it may not be possible to resolve the primary function for members of this family by sequence comparison alone. A number of similar molybdoproteins in which the N-terminal region contains a CXXXC motif and may bind an iron-sulphur cluster are excluded from this set, including formate dehydrogenases and nitrate reductases. Also excluded is the A chain of a heteromeric, anaerobic DMSO reductase, which also contains the CXXXC motif [[cite:PUB00007981]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dms", "name" "STRUCTURE OF DMSO REDUCTASE"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00509" "molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide-containing S/N-oxide reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide-containing S/N-oxide reductase", "short" "BisC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 253, "taxa" 1961, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3905, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3905, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3005}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1535", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1535"} {"accession" "GenProp1582", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1582"} {"accession" "GenProp1341", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1341"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
