{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Anti-adapter protein SpxO from Bacillus subtilis and similar sequences from Bacillus species. SpxO is an inhibitor of Spx proteolytic control, while Spx is a global regulator of the oxidative stress response [[cite:PUB00151439]]. SpxO acts by interacting with SpxH/YjbH, which disrupts interaction between SpxH and Spx, and inhibits SpxH-enhanced proteolysis of Spx by ClpXP [[cite:PUB00151321]]. It is required for the stabilisation of Spx and activation of Spx-regulated genes in response to cell wall stress [[cite:PUB00151322]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041458" "anti-adapter protein SpxO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-adapter protein SpxO-like", "short" "SpxO-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048179", :literature {"PUB00151321" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Kommineni S" "Garg SK" "Chan CM" "Zuber P."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "YjbH-enhanced proteolysis of Spx by ClpXP in Bacillus subtilis is inhibited by the small protein YirB (YuzO).", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "2133-40", "volume" "193", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21378193}, "PUB00151322" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Rojas-Tapias DF" "Helmann JD."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "Stabilization of Bacillus subtilis Spx under cell wall stress requires the anti-adaptor protein YirB.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "e1007531", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30001325}, "PUB00151439" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Schafer H" "Turgay K."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Genet", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00294-019-00950-6", "medline_journal" "Curr Genet", "title" "Spx, a versatile regulator of the Bacillus subtilis stress response.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "871-876", "volume" "65", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30830258}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048179", "name" "Anti-adapter protein SpxO-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
