{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are VapC proteins that consist almost entirely of a PIN (PilT N terminus) domain. This family was originally defined a set of twelve closely related paralogs found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but additional members are found now Synechococcus sp. WH8102, etc. This family includes ribonucleases VapC24 and Vap25 among others. They are the toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. They act as an RNase and all their toxic effects are neutralised by coexpression with cognate antitoxin [[cite:PUB00067485]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7vwo", "name" "TA complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029060", "name" "PIN-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00028" "TA system VapC family ribonuclease toxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PIN domain toxin", "short" "Mtu_PIN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 457, "taxa" 2658, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4271, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4271, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3030}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006226", :literature {"PUB00067485" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Ramage HR" "Connolly LE" "Cox JS."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000767", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "Comprehensive functional analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis toxin-antitoxin systems: implications for pathogenesis, stress responses, and evolution.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e1000767", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20011113}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016788", "name" "hydrolase activity, acting on ester bonds", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022907", "name" "VapC family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006226", "name" "PIN domain toxin", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016647", "name" "Probable ribonuclease VapC, Thermococci", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
