{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents Zygote arrest protein 1 (ZAR1) and its homologues ZAR1-like proteins. ZAR1 is essential for female fertility and oocyte-to-embryo transition by coordinating maternal mRNA storage, translation and degradation [[cite:PUB00061780], [cite:PUB00103615], [cite:PUB00103616]]. It is a mRNA-binding protein that mediates formation of MARDO (mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain), a membraneless compartment that stores maternal mRNAs in oocytes [[cite:PUB00103616]]. MARDO assembly around mitochondria is directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth [[cite:PUB00103616]]. ZAR1 binds to the 3'-UTR of maternal mRNAs [[cite:PUB00103615]]. Maternal mRNAs stored in the MARDO are translationally repressed [[cite:PUB00103616]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31054" "ZYGOTE ARREST PROTEIN 1-LIKE ISOFORM X1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zygote arrest protein 1", "short" "Zar1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 651, "taxa" 2252, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1701, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1701, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1150}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026775", :literature {"PUB00103615" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Rong Y" "Ji SY" "Zhu YZ" "Wu YW" "Shen L" "Fan HY."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "ZAR1 and ZAR2 are required for oocyte meiotic maturation by regulating the maternal transcriptome and mRNA translational activation.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "11387-11402", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31598710}, "PUB00103616" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6617", "authors" ["Cheng S" "Altmeppen G" "So C" "Welp LM" "Penir S" "Ruhwedel T" "Menelaou K" "Harasimov K" "Stutzer A" "Blayney M" "Elder K" "Mobius W" "Urlaub H" "Schuh M."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Mammalian oocytes store mRNAs in a mitochondria-associated membraneless compartment.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "eabq4835", "volume" "378", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36264786}, "PUB00061780" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wu X" "Viveiros MM" "Eppig JJ" "Bai Y" "Fitzpatrick SL" "Matzuk MM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
