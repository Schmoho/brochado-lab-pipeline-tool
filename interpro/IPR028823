{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sodium leak channel non-selective protein (NALCN) was first described as a voltage-independent, cation-nonselective channel which is permeable to sodium, potassium and calcium ions [[cite:PUB00069387]], however, it was recently reported to be selective only for monovalent cations and to be blocked by extracellular divalent cations [[cite:PUB00100244]]. Coexpression of NALCN, UNC79, UNC80, and NALF1 results in voltage-dependent NALCN currents [[cite:PUB00100244], [cite:PUB00100247]]. It is responsible for the background sodium ion leak current in neurons and controls neuronal excitability. It is activated either by neuropeptides substance P or neurotensin [[cite:PUB00069388]]. NALCN is required for normal respiratory rhythm and neonatal survival [[cite:PUB00069387]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46141" "SODIUM LEAK CHANNEL NON-SELECTIVE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sodium leak channel NALCN", "short" "NALCN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 900, "taxa" 3668, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3062, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3062, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 907}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028823", :literature {"PUB00069387" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lu B" "Su Y" "Das S" "Liu J" "Xia J" "Ren D."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.041", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "The neuronal channel NALCN contributes resting sodium permeability and is required for normal respiratory rhythm.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "371-83", "volume" "129", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17448995}, "PUB00069388" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7230", "authors" ["Lu B" "Su Y" "Das S" "Wang H" "Wang Y" "Liu J" "Ren D."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature07579", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Peptide neurotransmitters activate a cation channel complex of NALCN and UNC-80.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "741-4", "volume" "457", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19092807}, "PUB00100247" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bouasse M" "Impheng H" "Servant Z" "Lory P" "Monteil A."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Functional expression of CLIFAHDD and IHPRF pathogenic variants of the NALCN channel in neuronal cells reveals both gain- and loss-of-function properties.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "11791", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31409833}, "PUB00100244" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Chua HC" "Wulf M" "Weidling C" "Rasmussen LP" "Pless SA."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "The NALCN channel complex is voltage sensitive and directly modulated by extracellular calcium.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "eaaz3154", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32494638}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005261", "name" "monoatomic cation channel activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR028823", "name" "Sodium leak channel NALCN", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
