{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HINT (histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein) are related to the HIT family members that carry a motif HxHxH/Qxx (x, is a hydrophobic amino acid) [[cite:PUB00005228]]. On the basis of sequence, substrate specificity, structure, evolution and mechanism, HIT proteins are classified into three branches: the Hint branch, which consists of adenosine 5' -monophosphoramide hydrolases, the FHIT branch, that consists of diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolases, and the GalT branch consisting of specific nucloside monophosphate transferases [[cite:PUB00008005]].</p>\n\n<p>HINT family includes members from all three forms of cellular life. In budding yeast Hnt1 has been shown to have adenosine monophosphoramidase activity [[cite:PUB00008002]]. It is involved in secretion, peroxisome formation and gene expression [[cite:PUB00008002], [cite:PUB00003069]].
