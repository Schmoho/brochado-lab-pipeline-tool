{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences represent 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase ([ec:1.1.1.60]), also called tartronate semialdehyde reductase. It follows glyoxylate carboligase and precedes glycerate kinase in D-glycerate pathway of glyoxylate degradation. The eventual product, 3-phosphoglycerate, is an intermediate of glycolysis and is readily metabolized. Tartronic semialdehyde, the substrate of this enzyme, may also come from other pathways, such as D-glucarate catabolism [[cite:PUB00009608], [cite:PUB00009609]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1vpd", "name" "X-Ray Crystal Structure of Tartronate Semialdehyde Reductase [Salmonella Typhimurium LT2]"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01505" "2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase"}, "hamap" {"MF_02032" "2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase [garR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase", "short" "Tartro_sem_red"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1674, "taxa" 7698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8624, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8624, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6785}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1514", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1514"} {"accession" "GenProp0716", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0716"} {"accession" "GenProp1675", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1675"} {"accession" "GenProp1225", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1225"} {"accession" "GenProp0714", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0714"} {"accession" "GenProp1374", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1374"} {"accession" "GenProp0689", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0689"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
