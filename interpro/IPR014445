{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents the glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetases with the GAT domain from archaea, bacteria to humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAD+ is involved electron transport and redox reactions and in DNA ligation and protein ADP-ribosylation. In yeast and most other organisms, NAD is generated through the de novo pathway and the salvage pathway. In the de novo pathway, quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). In the salvage pathway, NaMN is generated by recycling of nicotinamide. Both pathways converge on NaMN, which is then converted into deamido-NAD+. Subsequently, deamido-NAD+ is converted to NAD+ by NAD+ synthetase [[cite:PUB00070122]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAD+ synthetase has been extensively studied in bacteria. It is encoded by nadE gene in E. coli and by outB gene in B. subtilis [[cite:PUB00070123]]. However, these enzymes are ammonia-dependent (containing an ammonia-utilising domain) and are not included in this entry [[cite:PUB00070124]]. The pokaryotic proteins in this family, such as that from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contain a nitrilase-related domain, are glutamine-dependent and are included in this entry [[cite:PUB00070124]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4f4h", "name" "Crystal structure of a Glutamine dependent NAD+ synthetase from Burkholderia thailandensis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR041856", "name" "Glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006630" "Glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase with GAT domain"}, "hamap" {"MF_02090" "Glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase [nadE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase", "short" "Gln-dep_NAD_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8721, "taxa" 31316, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33315, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32340, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23789}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
