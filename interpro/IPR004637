{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of L-diaminobutyric acid transaminases. This general designation covers both [ec:2.6.1.76] (diaminobutyrate-2-oxoglutarate transaminase, which uses glutamate as the amino donor in DABA biosynthesis), and [ec:2.6.1.46] (diaminobutyrate--pyruvate transaminase, which uses alanine as the amino donor). Most members with known function are [ec:2.6.1.76], and at least some annotations as [ec:2.6.1.46] in current databases at time of model revision are incorrect. A distinct branch of this family contains examples of [ec:2.6.1.76] nearly all of which are involved in ectoine biosynthesis. \r\n[ec:2.6.1.76] has also been characterised as part of an alternative polyamine biosynthetic pathway in Vibrio cholerae. A related enzyme is 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (EC [ec:2.6.1.19]), also called GABA transaminase. These enzymes all are pyridoxal phosphate-containing class III aminotransferase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00709" "diaminobutyrate--2-oxoglutarate transaminase family protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR43552" "DIAMINOBUTYRATE--2-OXOGLUTARATE AMINOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2,4-diaminobutyrate 4-transaminase", "short" "Dat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2237, "taxa" 9489, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11263, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11262, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8756}, "pathways" 48}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
