{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TATA box binding protein associated factor RNA Polymerase I subunit A (TAF1A/TAFI48) is found in eukaryotes and is encoded by the gene TAF1A in humans. Its function is to aid transcription of DNA into RNA by binding to the promoter at the -10 TATA box site. It is a component of the transcription factor SL1/TIF-IB complex, involved in PIC assembly (pre-initiation complex) during RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. The rate of PIC formation depends on the rate of association of this protein. This protein also stabilises nucleolar transcription factor 1/UBTF on rDNA [[cite:PUB00089723], [cite:PUB00088436]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes TAF1A homologues from plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14929" "TAF RNA Polymerase I subunit A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TATA box-binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase I subunit A", "short" "TAF1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 1015, "taxa" 3757, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1975, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1912, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1230}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039495", :literature {"PUB00089723" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5193", "authors" ["Comai L" "Zomerdijk JC" "Beckmann H" "Zhou S" "Admon A" "Tjian R."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7801123", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Reconstitution of transcription factor SL1: exclusive binding of TBP by SL1 or TFIID subunits.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "1966-72", "volume" "266", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7801123}, "PUB00088436" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Friedrich JK" "Panov KI" "Cabart P" "Russell J" "Zomerdijk JC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
