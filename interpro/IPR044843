{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trans-Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthases (Trans_IPPS) catalyze a head-to-head (HH) (1'-1) condensation reaction [[cite:PUB00081722]]. This entry includes squalene and phytoene synthases which catalyze the 1'-1 condensation of two 15-carbon (farnesyl) and 20-carbon (geranylgeranyl) isoprenyl diphosphates, respectively [[cite:PUB00081714], [cite:PUB00081719], [cite:PUB00081717], [cite:PUB00081718]]. The catalytic site consists of a large central cavity formed by mostly antiparallel Î± helices with two aspartate-rich regions (DXXXD) located on opposite walls [[cite:PUB00081715]]. These residues mediate binding of prenyl phosphates [[cite:PUB00010618]]. A two-step reaction has been proposed for squalene synthase (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase) in which, two molecules of FPP react to form a stable cyclopropylcarbinyl diphosphate intermediate, and then the intermediate undergoes heterolysis, isomerization, and reduction with NADPH to form squalene, a precursor of cholesterol. The carotenoid biosynthesis enzyme, phytoene synthase (CrtB), catalyses the condensation reaction of two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to produce phytoene, a precursor of beta-carotene [[cite:PUB00081720]]. These enzymes produce the triterpene and tetraterpene precursors for many diverse sterol and carotenoid end products and are widely distributed among eukaryota, bacteria, and archaea [[cite:PUB00081721]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes squalene and phytoene synthases found in bacteria, archaea, fungi, plant chloroplasts and insects.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8is9", "name" "CrtMLIKE with one FsPP molecule"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008949", "name" "Isoprenoid synthase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDG01212" "Phytoene synthase like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, bacterial-type", "short" "Trans_IPPS_bact-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5225, "taxa" 19066, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26285, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26218, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19684}, "pathways" 55}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
