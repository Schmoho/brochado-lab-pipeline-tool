{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AHH containing protein is a predicted nuclease of the HNH/ENDO VII superfamily of the treble clef fold. The name is derived from the conserved motif, AHH. It is found in bacterial polymorphic toxin systems [[cite:PUB00057479]] and functions as a toxin module. Like WHH and LHH, the AHH nuclease contains 4 conserved histidines of which, the first one is predicted to bind a metal-ion and the other three ones are involved in activation of a water molecule for hydrolysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14412" "A nuclease family of the HNH/ENDO VII superfamily with conserved AHH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AHH domain-containing protein", "short" "AHH_dom_containing"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 174, "proteomes" 443, "taxa" 2716, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2902, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2902, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1903}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032871", :literature {"PUB00057479" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Zhang D" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr036", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "A novel immunity system for bacterial nucleic acid degrading toxins and its recruitment in various eukaryotic and DNA viral systems.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "4532-52", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21306995}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR032871", "name" "AHH domain-containing protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 53, "alignment:full" 694}}}
