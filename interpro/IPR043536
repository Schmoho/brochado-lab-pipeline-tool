{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Host cell factor 1 (HCF1) and Host cell factor 2 (HCF2) from humans. They contain an N-terminal kelch domain and a C-terminal FnIII domain. However, HCF2 is smaller than HCF-1, lacking the complete central region including the HCF1 specific repeats and as a result is not subject to proteolytic processing [[cite:PUB00094183]]. This entry also includes their Drosophila melanogaster homologue, dHCF, which is involved in both activation and repression of transcription during fly development [[cite:PUB00088156]].

HCFC1 recruits and is a part of several different complexes, including the SET1 histone methyltransferase complex (transcription activation), the SIN3 histone deacetylase complex (transcription repression) [[cite:PUB00033478]], the THAP1/THAP3-HCFC1-OGT complex (required for the regulation of the transcriptional activity of RRM1) [[cite:PUB00060556]], and the NSL complex (acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4) [[cite:PUB00060167]].</p>\n\n<p>HCF2 is involved in activation of differentiation and morphogenesis gene expression programs, and in parallel in inhibition of cellular growth and metabolism [[cite:PUB00094184]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46003" "HOST CELL FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Host cell factor", "short" "HCF1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 979, "taxa" 4064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3675, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3675, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1548}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043536", :literature {"PUB00100195" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sabina RL" "Ogasawara N" "Holmes EW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell Biol", "title" "Expression of three stage-specific transcripts of AMP deaminase during myogenesis.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "2244-6", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2568582}, "PUB00033478" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wysocka J" "Myers MP" "Laherty CD" "Eisenman RN" "Herr W."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.252103", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Human Sin3 deacetylase and trithorax-related Set1/Ash2 histone H3-K4 methyltransferase are tethered together selectively by the cell-proliferation factor HCF-1.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "896-911", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12670868}, "PUB00060556" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Mazars R" "Gonzalez-de-Peredo A" "Cayrol C" "Lavigne AC" "Vogel JL" "Ortega N" "Lacroix C" "Gautier V" "Huet G" "Ray A" "Monsarrat B" "Kristie TM" "Girard JP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
