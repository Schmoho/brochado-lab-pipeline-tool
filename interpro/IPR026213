{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GRINL1, also known as Gdown1, is a component of the Pol II (G) complex form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Pol II synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs and is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Gdown1 associates with Pol II, in competition with TFIIF, during the early stage of transcript elongation, where it facilitates the pausing for promoter-dependent pol II complexes [[cite:PUB00103731], [cite:PUB00103729], [cite:PUB00103730], [cite:PUB00103735]]. Pausing during the earliest stage of transcript elongation by Pil II is an universal control point in metazoan gene expression. Gdown1 is a negative regulator of transcriptional activation; this repression is relieved by the Mediator complex, which restores Pol II(G) activator-dependent transcription to a level equivalent to that of Pol II [[cite:PUB00103730], [cite:PUB00103735], [cite:PUB00060225]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02085" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit GRINL1"}, "pfam" {"PF15328" "Putative GRINL1B complex locus protein 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit GRINL1", "short" "GRINL1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 809, "taxa" 3131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3621, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1076}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026213", :literature {"PUB00060225" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Hu X" "Malik S" "Negroiu CC" "Hubbard K" "Velalar CN" "Hampton B" "Grosu D" "Catalano J" "Roeder RG" "Gnatt A."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
