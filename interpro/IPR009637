{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of transmembrane proteins, including mammalian GPR107, GPR108, TMEM87A and TMEM87B which have been collectively termed lung seven transmembrane receptor or LUSTR and are evolutionary related. Together with GPR180, TMEM145, TMEM181, and WLS, they have been described as GOST proteins (for GOLD domain seven-transmembrane helix proteins)  given they share the same domain architecture consisting of a GOLD domain atop of a membrane-spanning seven-transmembrane helix domain [[cite:PUB00151072]].</p>\n\n<p>GPR107 and GPR108 localize to the Golgi and have suggested roles in protein trafficking [[cite:PUB00151072], [cite:PUB00077130]]. GPR107 is implicated in the transport of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exotoxin A, Campylobacter jejuni cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), and ricin, while GPR107 knockout cells display deficits in receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling [[cite:PUB00151075]]. GPR108 is critical for the transduction of a majority of AAV serotypes [[cite:PUB00151074], [cite:PUB00151076]]. It may play a potential role in the regulation of Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling [[cite:PUB00151073]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes proteins from fungi and plants [[cite:PUB00077131]]. The plant proteins in this entry, including CAND6 and CAND7, are predicted to be G-protein coupled receptors [[cite:PUB00093391]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21229" "LUNG SEVEN TRANSMEMBRANE RECEPTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane protein GPR107/GPR108-like", "short" "GPR107/GPR108-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2583, "taxa" 8861, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11984, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7530}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009637", :literature {"PUB00151073" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Dong D" "Zhou H" "Na SY" "Niedra R" "Peng Y" "Wang H" "Seed B" "Zhou GL."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "GPR108, an NF-ÎºB activator suppressed by TIRAP, negatively regulates TLR-triggered immune responses.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "e0205303", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30332431}, "PUB00151076" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Meisen WH" "Nejad ZB" "Hardy M" "Zhao H" "Oliverio O" "Wang S" "Hale C" "Ollmann MM" "Collins PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev", "title" "Pooled Screens Identify GPR108 and TM9SF2 as Host Cell Factors Critical for AAV Transduction.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "601-611", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32280726}, "PUB00151072" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hoel CM" "Zhang L" "Brohawn SG."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Structure of the GOLD-domain seven-transmembrane helix protein family member TMEM87A.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e81704", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36373655}, "PUB00151075" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 18", "authors" ["Zhou GL" "Na SY" "Niedra R" "Seed B."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Sci", "title" "Deficits in receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling in cells from mice with Gpr107 locus disruption.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "3916-27", "volume" "127", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24849652}, "PUB00151074" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Dudek AM" "Zabaleta N" "Zinn E" "Pillay S" "Zengel J" "Porter C" "Franceschini JS" "Estelien R" "Carette JE" "Zhou GL" "Vandenberghe LH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Ther", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Ther", "title" "GPR108 Is a Highly Conserved AAV Entry Factor.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "367-381", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31784416}, "PUB00077130" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Tafesse FG" "Guimaraes CP" "Maruyama T" "Carette JE" "Lory S" "Brummelkamp TR" "Ploegh HL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
