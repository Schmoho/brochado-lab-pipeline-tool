{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (BGP), also known as osteocalcin, and matrix gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP) are the only vitamin K-dependent proteins that have been isolated from bone. MGP is a small protein found in bone, dentin and cartilage. It contains five gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues (formed by post-translational modification of glutamic acid by vitamin K-dependent carboxylase) and a single disulphide bond. BGP is a 49 residue protein found in bone. It contains three Gla residues and a single disulphide bond. There is little similarity between these vitamin K-dependent bone proteins and the blood coagulation proteins, though they are believed to have diverged from a common ancestor [[cite:PUB00004648]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4mzz", "name" "Crystal structure of Bovine 3 Glu-Osteocalcin."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035972", "name" "Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (GLA) domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00002" "GLABONE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Osteocalcin/matrix Gla protein", "short" "Osteocalcin/MGP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 378, "taxa" 1290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1278, "sets" 0, "proteins" 639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 471}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002384", :literature {"PUB00004648" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Price PA" "Fraser JD" "Metz-Virca G."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
