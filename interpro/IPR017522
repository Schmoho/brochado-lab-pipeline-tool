{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family contain a glycosyl transferase group 1 domain. Nearly all are found in species that encode the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system predicted to act in protein sorting in a number of Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, these transferases are found proximal to a particular variant of exosortase, EpsH1, which appears to travel with a conserved group of genes summarized by [genprop:GenProp0652]. The nature of the sugar transferase reaction catalysed by members of this clade is unknown and may conceivably be variable with respect to substrate by species, but we hypothesize a conserved substrate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03088" "TIGR03088 family PEP-CTERM/XrtA system glycosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sugar transferase, PEP-CTERM, Stp2", "short" "Sugar_tfrase_PEP-CTERM_Stp2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 916, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 789, "sets" 0, "proteins" 789, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 603}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0652", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0652"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017522", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017522", "name" "Sugar transferase, PEP-CTERM, Stp2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
