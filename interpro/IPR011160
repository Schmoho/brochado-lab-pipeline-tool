{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, or sphingomyelinase (SMase), enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) and phosphorylcholine. There are six types of SMases: acid SMase, secretory SMase, neutral magnesium-dependent SMase, neutral magnesium-independent SMase, alkaline SMase, and bacterial SMase [[cite:PUB00014800]]. This entry covers the acid SMases.</p>\r\n<p>Sphingomyelin is a ubiquitous lipid found in plasma membranes, as well in lipoproteins; in mammalian cells, it is the most abundant sphingolipid. Sphingoid molecules generated from the breakdown of sphingolipids can act as intracellular bio-modulators. In particular, ceramide can act as a second messenger in diverse signalling pathways leading to different cellular responses, such as apoptosis [[cite:PUB00014801]]. Hence, SMase activation can be an early event in the apoptosis-signalling cascade. SMase is regulated by several mechanisms, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated protein FAN (Factor Associated with N-sphingomyelinase activation) and oxidative stress.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000948" "Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (acid sphingomyelinase)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase", "short" "Sphingomy_PDE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1212, "taxa" 4466, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3459, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3212, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1981}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
