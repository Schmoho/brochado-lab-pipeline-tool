{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Plant-specific TFIIB-related protein PTF2 is characterised by its unique role in plant development, particularly in pollen germination and embryogenesis. Members of this family, such as PTF2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, are known to interact with TBP2 and RNA polymerase subunits, suggesting a regulatory function in gene expression. These proteins have the ability to bind double-stranded DNA in vitro, which further supports their involvement in transcriptional regulation [[cite:PUB00154397]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48428" "PLANT-SPECIFIC TFIIB-RELATED PROTEIN PTF2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plant-specific TFIIB-related protein PTF2", "short" "PTF2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 237, "taxa" 941, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 569, "sets" 0, "proteins" 569, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 315}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053340", :literature {"PUB00154397" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Niu QK" "Liang Y" "Zhou JJ" "Dou XY" "Gao SC" "Chen LQ" "Zhang XQ" "Ye D."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Plant", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst083", "medline_journal" "Mol Plant", "title" "Pollen-expressed transcription factor 2 encodes a novel plant-specific TFIIB-related protein that is required for pollen germination and embryogenesis in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1091-108", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23713077}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053340", "name" "Plant-specific TFIIB-related protein PTF2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
