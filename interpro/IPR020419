{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily comprises more than 20 type-I transmembrane proteins. Family members are defined based on similarity in their extracellular domain - a region that contains many cysteine residues arranged in a specific repetitive pattern [[cite:PUB00046030]]. The cysteines allow formation of an extended rod-like structure, responsible for ligand binding [[cite:PUB00000892]].</p>\n\n<p>Upon receptor activation, different intracellular signalling complexes are assembled for different members of the TNFR superfamily, depending on their intracellular domains and sequences [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Activation of TNFRs can therefore induce a range of disparate effects, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, or apoptotic cell death, depending upon the receptor involved [[cite:PUB00046032], [cite:PUB00046033]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TNFRs are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial biological processes, such as lymphoid and neuronal development, innate and adaptive immunity, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Drugs that manipulate their signaling have potential roles in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, such as viral infections, coronary heart disease, transplant rejection, and immune disease [[cite:PUB00046034]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011029", "name" "Death-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01918" "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 1A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 1A", "short" "TNFR_1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 449, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 950, "sets" 0, "proteins" 265, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 178}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020419", :literature {"PUB00046030" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Armitage RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
