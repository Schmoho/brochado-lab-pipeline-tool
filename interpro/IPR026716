{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the PPP2R1A-PPP2R2A-interacting phosphatase regulators (PABIRs), also known as FAM122 which includes PABIR1, PABIR2 and PABIR3 family members (FAM122A, B and C, respectively). The most studied member is PABIR1/FAM122A, which was identified as an inhibitor of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity [[cite:PUB00096699], [cite:PUB00096700]]. It potentiates ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PPP2CA) [[cite:PUB00096699]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22227" "FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 122B ISOFORM X1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PABIR1/2/3", "short" "PBIR1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 902, "taxa" 3564, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2874, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2874, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1887}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026716", :literature {"PUB00096700" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Li F" "Kozono D" "Deraska P" "Branigan T" "Dunn C" "Zheng XF" "Parmar K" "Nguyen H" "DeCaprio J" "Shapiro GI" "Chowdhury D" "D'Andrea AD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "CHK1 Inhibitor Blocks Phosphorylation of FAM122A and Promotes Replication Stress.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "410-422.e6", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33108758}, "PUB00096699" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Fan L" "Liu MH" "Guo M" "Hu CX" "Yan ZW" "Chen J" "Chen GQ" "Huang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Oncotarget", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncotarget", "title" "FAM122A, a new endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "63887-63900", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27588481}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0004865", "name" "protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026716", "name" "PABIR1/2/3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
