{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum. GldF is believed to be a ABC transporter permease protein (along with ATP-binding subunit, GldA and a substrate-binding subunit, GldG) and is linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Knockouts of GldF abolish the gliding phenotype [[cite:PUB00045356]]. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species C. johnsonae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03518" "gliding motility-associated ABC transporter permease subunit GldF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility-associated ABC transporter permease protein GldF", "short" "Motility-assoc_ABC_perm_GldF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 678, "taxa" 2063, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2144, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2144, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1648}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019860", :literature {"PUB00045356" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hunnicutt DW" "Kempf MJ" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
