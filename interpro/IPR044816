{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The BURP domain was named after the proteins in which it was first identified: BNM2, USP, RD22, and PG1beta. It is found in the C terminus of a number of plant cell wall proteins, which are defined not only by the BURP domain, but also by the overall similarity in their modular construction. The BURP domain-containing proteins consists of either three or four modules: (i) an N-terminal hydrophobic domain - a presumptive transit peptide, joined to (ii) a short conserved segment or other short segment, (iii) an optional segment consisting of repeated units which is unique to each member, and (iv) the C-terminal BURP domain. Although the BURP domain proteins share primary structural features, their expression patterns and the conditions under which they are expressed differ. The presence of the conserved BURP domain in diverse plant proteins suggests an important and fundamental functional role for this domain [[cite:PUB00007716]]. It is possible that the BURP domain represents a general motif for localization of proteins within the cell wall matrix. The other structural domains associated with the BURP domain may specify other target sites for intermolecular interactions [[cite:PUB00043785]].</p>\n\n<p>Some proteins known to contain a BURP domain are listed below [[cite:PUB00007716], [cite:PUB00043785], [cite:PUB00043786]]:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brassica protein BNM2, which is expressed during the induction of microspore embryogenesis.</li>\n<li>Field bean USPs, abundant non-storage seed proteins with unknown function.</li>\n<li>Soybean USP-like proteins ADR6 (or SALI5-4A), an auxin-repressible, aluminium-inducible protein and SALI3-2, a protein that is up-regulated by aluminium.</li>\n<li>Soybean seed coat BURP-domain protein 1 (SCB1).
