{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are small (~ 80 amino acids) and occur in biosynthesis clusters for cyanobactins, a type of ribosomal natural product, thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM). The function of this protein family is unknown, and the recognised cyanobactin precursors (e.g., microcyclamides and patellamides) are encoded by a different protein. In this protein family, however, a core region of about 62 amino acids is followed by a hypervariable region of 5 to 23 amino acids, with hallmarks of possible cyclodehydratase modification sites. The hallmarks include Cys residues flanked by Gly, and variable length Ser-rich tripeptide repeats. Further, members of this family were shown dispensible for patellamide biosynthesis, and two may occur in a cluster. Therefore, this family may represent a precursor of another type of ribosomal natural product [[cite:PUB00060495]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04220" "cyanobactin biosynthesis system PatB/AcyB/McaB family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyanobactin biosynthesis protein, PatB/AcyB/McaB family", "short" "PatB_AcyB_McaB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 333, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 191, "sets" 0, "proteins" 191, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 168}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1083", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1083"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026473", :literature {"PUB00060495" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Leikoski N" "Fewer DP" "Jokela J" "Wahlsten M" "Rouhiainen L" "Sivonen K."], "ISO_journal" "Appl.
