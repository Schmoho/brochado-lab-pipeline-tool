{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are integral membrane proteins that belong to the small multidrug resistance (SMR) protein family. They confer resistance to a wide range of toxic compounds by removing them for the cells. The efflux is coupled to an influx of protons. An example is Escherichia coli EmrE ([swissprot:P23895]) which plays a role in pH and osmotic stress response and biofilm formation. It confers resistance to a wide range of toxic compounds, including ethidium, methyl viologen [[cite:PUB00009428], [cite:PUB00098572]], benzalkonium, propidium, dequalinium, different aromatic cation antibiotics, being also involved in ethidium bromide efflux [[cite:PUB00009429], [cite:PUB00095577]]. It simultaneously binds and co-transports proton and drug [[cite:PUB00098572], [cite:PUB00095576]]. Structural studies of EmrE revealed that the transmembrane (TM) helices undergo a complex reorientation to bind and transport diverse substrates. It may function not only as a proton-coupled antiporter but also as a proton-coupled symporter or uncoupled uniporter that potentially confers susceptibility rather than resistance, because the inward proton motive force and negative-inside membrane potential in bacteria would lead to concentrative uptake of toxic cations [[cite:PUB00098572]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00893" "Small Multidrug Resistance protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small multidrug resistance protein", "short" "Small_multidrug_res"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 24, "proteomes" 6098, "taxa" 23833, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 47003, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46998, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36983}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045324", :literature {"PUB00098572" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shcherbakov AA" "Hisao G" "Mandala VS" "Thomas NE" "Soltani M" "Salter EA" "Davis JH Jr" "Henzler-Wildman KA" "Hong M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structure and dynamics of the drug-bound bacterial transporter EmrE in lipid bilayers.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "172", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33420032}, "PUB00009428" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Morimyo M" "Hongo E" "Hama-Inaba H" "Machida I."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/20.12.3159", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Cloning and characterization of the mvrC gene of Escherichia coli K-12 which confers resistance against methyl viologen toxicity.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "3159-65", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1320256}, "PUB00095576" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["Robinson AE" "Thomas NE" "Morrison EA" "Balthazor BM" "Henzler-Wildman KA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "New free-exchange model of EmrE transport.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "E10083-E10091", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29114048}, "PUB00009429" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Purewal AS."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
