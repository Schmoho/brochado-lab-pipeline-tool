{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of metallopeptidases belong to the MEROPS peptidase family M18, (clan MH). The proteins have two catalytic zinc ions at the active site, bound by His/Asp, Asp, Glu, Asp/Glu and His. The catalysed reaction involves the release of an N-terminal aminoacid, usually neutral or hydrophobic, from a polypeptide [[cite:PUB00003579]].</p>\n\n<p>The type example is aminopeptidase I from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), the sequence of which has been deduced, and the mature protein shown to consist of 469 amino acids [[cite:PUB00002544]]. A 45-residue presequence contains both positively- and negatively-charged and hydrophobic residues, which could be arranged in an N-terminal amphiphilic Î±-helix [[cite:PUB00002544]]. The presequence differs from signal sequences that direct proteins across bacterial plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticulum or into mitochondria. It is unclear how this unique presequence targets aminopeptidase I to yeast vacuoles, and how this sorting utilises classical protein secretory pathways [[cite:PUB00002544]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5jgf", "name" "Crystal structure of mApe1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023358", "name" "Peptidase M18, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28570" "ASPARTYL AMINOPEPTIDASE"}, "pfam" {"PF02127" "Aminopeptidase I zinc metalloprotease (M18)"}, "prints" {"PR00932" "AMINO1PTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M18", "short" "Peptidase_M18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 116, "proteomes" 5101, "taxa" 18394, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21184, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20698, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14934}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
