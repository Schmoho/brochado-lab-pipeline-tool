{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents protein spackle from Bacteriophage T4, which inhibits viral DNA ejection into the host cytoplasm, thereby conferring the infected host bacteria with immunity against secondary phage infection [[cite:PUB00100549]]. It localizes to the periplasm and inhibits the activity of tail-associated lysozyme, thereby preventing penetration by the tail tube of incoming phages [[cite:PUB00100548], [cite:PUB00100550]]. It interacts with the baseplate central spike protein gp5, therefore, spackle selectively inhibits the lysozyme activity of gp5, but not that of T4 lysozyme.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7cn7", "name" "T4 phage spackle protein gp61.3 complex with lysozyme domain of gp5 tail lysozyme"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04159" "Protein spackle [sp]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein spackle", "short" "SPACKLE_T4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 538, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 391, "sets" 0, "proteins" 391, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046391", :literature {"PUB00100548" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kanamaru S" "Uchida K" "Nemoto M" "Fraser A" "Arisaka F" "Leiman PG."], "ISO_journal" "Viruses", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Viruses", "title" "Structure and Function of the T4 Spackle Protein Gp61.3.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32987925}, "PUB00100549" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Cornett JB."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Spackle and immunity functions of bacteriophage T4.", "year" 1974, "raw_pages" "312-21", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 4589853}, "PUB00100550" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shi K" "Oakland JT" "Kurniawan F" "Moeller NH" "Banerjee S" "Aihara H."], "ISO_journal" "Commun Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Commun Biol", "title" "Structural basis of superinfection exclusion by bacteriophage T4 Spackle.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "691", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33214665}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0098669", "name" "superinfection exclusion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046391", "name" "Protein spackle", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
