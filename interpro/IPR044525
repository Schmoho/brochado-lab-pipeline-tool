{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthases, including DGDG1 and DGDG2 from Arabidopsis. They are involved in the synthesis of the chloroplast lipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) [[cite:PUB00096348]]. DGDG provides stability to the photosystem I (PSI) complex, especially to the PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaL and PsaH subunits [[cite:PUB00096349], [cite:PUB00096350]]. The DGDG1 and DGDG2  homologues can also be found in soybean and Lotus. Besides in plastids, they are also expressed during later stages of nodule development in infected cells and in cortical tissue [[cite:PUB00096351]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46132" "DIGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHASE 2, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase 1/2", "short" "DGDG1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 333, "taxa" 1533, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1999, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1999, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1325}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
