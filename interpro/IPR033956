{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Translin (also known as TB-RBP for Testis Brain RNA-binding protein, a mouse orthologue), is a paralogue of its binding partner protein TRAX (translin-associated factor-X) [[cite:PUB00005776]] and together they form oligomeric complexes known as C3PO proteins (for component 3 promoter of  RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC) [[cite:PUB00081871]].  DNA damage has been proposed to stimulate transport of Translin into nuclei. It binds to RNA and single-stranded DNA, and its selectivity is modulated by interactions with GTP and TRAX. Translin may also regulate dendritic trafficking of BDNF RNAs as well as function as a key activator of siRNA-mediated silencing in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00081872]]. Translin and Trax participate in a variety of nucleic acid metabolism pathways in addition to RNAi and have been implicated in a wide range of biological activities, including mRNA processing, cell growth regulation, spermatogenesis, neuronal development/function, genome stability regulation and carcinogenesis [[cite:PUB00081875], [cite:PUB00081874], [cite:PUB00081876]]; however, their precise role in some of the processes remains unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036081", "name" "Translin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016068", "name" "Translin, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14819" "Translin, also known as TB-RBP (testis brain RNA-binding protein)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translin", "short" "Translin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2131, "taxa" 7114, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3219, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3219, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2072}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033956", :literature {"PUB00081874" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Li Z" "Wu Y" "Baraban JM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
