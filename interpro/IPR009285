{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents A26L from Vaccinia virus, also known as Envelop protein OPG153, and similar sequences from poxvirus. A26L is an envelop protein that mediates acid-dependent endocytosis into host cells [[cite:PUB00103659]]. It plays an important role in endocytic entry of the virus by acting as an acid-sensitive membrane fusion suppressor [[cite:PUB00103657], [cite:PUB00103658]]. Low pH in host endosomes triggers conformational changes to allow de-repression of viral fusion complex activity and membrane fusion within vesicles [[cite:PUB00103658]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6a9s", "name" "The crystal structure of vaccinia virus A26 (residues 1-397)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06086" "Orthopoxvirus A26L/A30L protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus A26L", "short" "Poxvirus_A26L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 290, "sets" 0, "proteins" 289, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009285", :literature {"PUB00103657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Chang SJ" "Shih AC" "Tang YL" "Chang W."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Vaccinia mature virus fusion regulator A26 protein binds to A16 and G9 proteins of the viral entry fusion complex and dissociates from mature virions at low pH.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "3809-18", "volume" "86", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22278246}, "PUB00103658" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Chang HW" "Yang CH" "Luo YC" "Su BG" "Cheng HY" "Tung SY" "Carillo KJD" "Liao YT" "Tzou DM" "Wang HC" "Chang W."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Vaccinia viral A26 protein is a fusion suppressor of mature virus and triggers membrane fusion through conformational change at low pH.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "e1007826", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31220181}, "PUB00103659" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Chang SJ" "Chang YX" "Izmailyan R" "Tang YL" "Chang W."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Vaccinia virus A25 and A26 proteins are fusion suppressors for mature virions and determine strain-specific virus entry pathways into HeLa, CHO-K1, and L cells.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "8422-32", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20538855}, "PUB00012257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Szajner P" "Weisberg AS" "Wolffe EJ" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
