{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein is conserved in Mycobacteriaceae and is likely to be a lipoprotein [[cite:PUB00044336]]. lpqN is involved in cell envelope lipid changes during biofilm maturation. It interacts with periplasmic loop domains of the MmpL3 and MmpL11 transporters that export mycolic acid-containing cell envelope lipids. It also interacts with secreted cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes such as Ag85A [[cite:PUB00095088]]. It has been shown to interact with host CBL, a host ubiquitin ligase, and probably blocks the normal functions of CBL and disturbs CBL-mediated antibacterial activity [[cite:PUB00095089]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes LpqT and Mtc28.
