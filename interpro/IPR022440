{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are restricted to the Proteobacteria. Each contains a C-terminal sortase-recognition motif, transmembrane domain, and basic residues cluster at the the C terminus, and is encoded adjacent to a sortase gene. This protein is frequently the only sortase target in its genome, which is as unusual its occurrence in Gram-negative rather than Gram-positive genomes. Many bacteria with this system are marine. In addition to the LPXTG signal, members carry a vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor domain ([pfam:PF08487]) and a von Willebrand factor type A domain ([pfam:PF00092]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03788" "marine proteobacterial sortase target protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03788", "short" "CHP03788"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 254, "taxa" 1538, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1371, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1020}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0859", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0859"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022440", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022440", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03788", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
