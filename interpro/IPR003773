These enzymes comprise two domains with α/β structures, a large domain and a small domain. A pocket between the two domains may form the active site, a conserved histidine located within this pocket could be the catalytic base [[cite:PUB00057460]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2czl", "name" "Crystal structure of MqnD (TTHA1568), a menaquinone biosynthetic enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (Cys11 modified with beta-mercaptoethanol)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02621" "Menaquinone biosynthesis"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Menaquinone biosynthesis enzyme", "short" "Menaquinone_biosynth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 33, "proteomes" 1726, "taxa" 7265, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16328, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15896, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11937}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0829", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0829"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
