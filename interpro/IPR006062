{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Histidine is formed by several complex and distinct biochemical reactions catalysed by eight enzymes. Proteins involved in steps 4 and 6 of the histidine biosynthesis pathway are contained in one family. These enzymes are called His6 and His7 in eukaryotes and HisA and HisF in prokaryotes. HisA is a phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.16]), involved in the fourth step of histidine biosynthesis. The bacterial HisF protein is a cyclase which catalyses the cyclization reaction that produces D-erythro-imidazole glycerol phosphate during the sixth step of histidine biosynthesis. The yeast His7 protein is a bifunctional protein which catalyses an amido-transferase reaction that generates imidazole-glycerol phosphate and 5-aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide. The latter is the ribonucleotide used for purine biosynthesis. The enzyme also catalyses the cyclization reaction that produces D-erythro-imidazole glycerol phosphate, and is involved in the fifth and sixth steps in histidine biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qo2", "name" "Crystal structure of N-((5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino)-5-aminoimidazol-4-carboxamid ribonucleotid isomerase (EC 3.1.3.15, HisA)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00977" "Histidine biosynthesis protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine biosynthesis protein", "short" "His_biosynth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 100, "domain_architectures" 195, "proteomes" 10196, "taxa" 38279, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 86749, "sets" 0, "proteins" 86178, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 65751}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
