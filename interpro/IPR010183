{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Recombination protein bet from Bacteriophage lambda (Bet, also known as red-beta). Bet functions in general recombination and in the late, rolling-circle mode of lambda DNA replication. It has a function similar to that of E.coli recT. It is a single-stranded DNA binding protein that can promote renaturation of DNA [[cite:PUB00099991], [cite:PUB00099988], [cite:PUB00099990]]. Members of this protein family are found in tailed bacteriophagues and bacterial prophagues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01913" "phage recombination protein Bet"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage lambda, Recombination protein bet", "short" "Phage_lambda_Bet"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 359, "taxa" 2700, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2073, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2073, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1406}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010183", :literature {"PUB00099991" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Smith CE" "Bell CE."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Domain Structure of the Redβ Single-Strand Annealing Protein: the C-terminal Domain is Required for Fine-Tuning DNA-binding Properties, Interaction with the Exonuclease Partner, and Recombination in vivo.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "561-578", "volume" "428", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26780547}, "PUB00099990" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Zakharova K" "Caldwell BJ" "Ta S" "Wheat CT" "Bell CE."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Mutational Analysis of Redβ Single Strand Annealing Protein: Roles of the 14 Lysine Residues in DNA Binding and Recombination In Vivo.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34299376}, "PUB00099988" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Caldwell BJ" "Zakharova E" "Filsinger GT" "Wannier TM" "Hempfling JP" "Chun-Der L" "Pei D" "Church GM" "Bell CE."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Crystal structure of the Redβ C-terminal domain in complex with λ Exonuclease reveals an unexpected homology with λ Orf and an interaction with Escherichia coli single stranded DNA binding protein.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1950-1963", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30624736}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006310", "name" "DNA recombination", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018330", "name" "RecT family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004590", "name" "DNA single-strand annealing protein RecT", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010183", "name" "Bacteriophage lambda, Recombination protein bet", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
