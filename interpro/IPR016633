{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes family members such as EarP enzymes which are essential for post-translational activation of elongation factor P (EF-P). It was identified as EF-P arginine R32 specific rhamnosyl transferase in Shewanella oneidensis using dTDP-beta-L-rhamnose as donor substrate [[cite:PUB00091040]]. This was further confirmed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa [[cite:PUB00091041], [cite:PUB00097941]], Pseudomonas putida [[cite:PUB00091042]] and Neisseria meningitidis [[cite:PUB00091043]]. As for S. oneidensis [[cite:PUB00091044]] and P. aeruginosa [[cite:PUB00091045]], EarP enzyme acts as an inverting glycosyltransferase, thus mediating the formation of an alpha-L-rhamnosidic linkage. Structural analysis show that EarP is composed of two opposing domains with Rossmann folds, thus constituting a B pattern-type glycosyltransferase (GT-B) and provide basis for arginine glycosylation by EarP [[cite:PUB00091042]]. Mutational analysis of efp and earP genes, resulted in a substantial decrease in the production of rhamnolipids and pyocyanin (important factors for colonization and invasion during infection) of P. aeruginosa. Collectively this indicates that EarP and EF-P are essential for P. aeruginosa pathogenicity [[cite:PUB00091040]]. The protein family is also annotated in the CaZy Database as GT104.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5wxk", "name" "EarP bound with domain I of EF-P"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03837" "elongation factor P maturation arginine rhamnosyltransferase EarP"}, "pfam" {"PF10093" "Elongation-Factor P (EF-P) rhamnosyltransferase EarP"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015557" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP015557 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein-arginine rhamnosyltransferase EarP", "short" "EarP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 785, "taxa" 3454, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3997, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3938, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2976}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
