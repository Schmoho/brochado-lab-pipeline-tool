{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family occur with a cassette of lanthionine-type peptide modification enzymes. Members are small (about 60 amino acids long), rich in Cys, and variable in copy number per genome (from one to three). These features suggest that members of this family are modified to become lantipeptides, although not necessarily a lantibiotic. There is no GlyGly cleavage motif to separate a leader peptide from core region.The considerable abundance in Streptomyces and relatively strong consideration hints at a non-antibiotic function. The motif FxLD in the N-terminal region is nearly invariant.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04363" "FxLD family lanthipeptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FxLD family lantipeptide", "short" "LD_lanti_pre"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 788, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 832, "sets" 0, "proteins" 832, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 609}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1069", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1069"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027575", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027575", "name" "FxLD family lantipeptide", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
