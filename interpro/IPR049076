{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Acetyl-CoA carboxylases, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (also known as acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase alpha, ACACA), which is cytosolic and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (also known as ACC-beta), which is mitochondrial. These enzymes catalyse the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the first and rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00152124], [cite:PUB00152123], [cite:PUB00152122]]. This is a 2 steps reaction starting with the ATP-dependent carboxylation of the biotin carried by the biotin carboxyl carrier (BCC) domain, followed by the transfer of the carboxyl group from carboxylated biotin to acetyl-CoA [[cite:PUB00152124], [cite:PUB00152123], [cite:PUB00152122]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1w96", "name" "Crystal Structure of Biotin Carboxylase Domain of Acetyl-coenzyme A Carboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Complex with Soraphen A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45728" "ACETYL-COA CARBOXYLASE, ISOFORM A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase", "short" "ACCA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 56, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2647, "taxa" 11706, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12109, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12109, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3961}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
