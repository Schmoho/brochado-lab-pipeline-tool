{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant WRKY transcription factors. In Arabidopsis, WRKY1 binds to a 5'-CGTTGACCGAG-3' consensus core sequence which contains a W box, a frequently occurring elicitor-responsive cis-acting element [[cite:PUB00097116]]. WRKY33 regulates the antagonistic relationship between defense pathways mediating responses to the bacterial pathogen P. syringae and the necrotrophic pathogen B.cinerea [[cite:PUB00097120]]. It functions as a convergent substrate of CPK5/CPK6 and MPK3/MPK6, which cooperatively regulate camalexin (an antimicrobial compound) biosynthesis via the differential phospho-regulation of WRKY33 activity [[cite:PUB00097119]]. WRKY33 also functions with WRKY25 as positive regulator of salt stress response and abscisic acid (ABA) signalling [[cite:PUB00097121]] and with WRKY25/WRKY26 as positive regulator of plant thermotolerance by partially participating in ethylene-response signal transduction pathway [[cite:PUB00097122]]. WRKY5 from rice acts as positive regulator of leaf senescence being involved in onset and progression of this process [[cite:PUB00101061]]. It acts as negative regulator of drought tolerance by inhibiting ABA-induced stomatal closure during drought stress [[cite:PUB00101060]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5w3x", "name" "Crystal structure of PopP2 in complex with IP6, AcCoA and the WRKY domain of RRS1-R ."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036576", "name" "WRKY domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31429" "WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 36-RELATED", "PTHR31221" "WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR PROTEIN 1-RELATED", "PTHR31282" "WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 21-RELATED", "PTHR32096" "WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 30-RELATED-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WRKY transcription factor, plant", "short" "WRKY_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 304, "taxa" 1988, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38400, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38400, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23836}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044810", :literature {"PUB00101060" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lim C" "Kang K" "Shim Y" "Yoo SC" "Paek NC."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Inactivating transcription factor OsWRKY5 enhances drought tolerance through abscisic acid signaling pathways.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "1900-1916", "volume" "188", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34718775}, "PUB00101061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Kim T" "Kang K" "Kim SH" "An G" "Paek NC."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "OsWRKY5 Promotes Rice Leaf Senescence via Senescence-Associated NAC and Abscisic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway.
