{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic corticotropin-releasing factor binding proteins (CRF-BP or CRH-BP). Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays multiple roles in vertebrate species. In mammals, it is the major hypothalamic releasing factor for pituitary adrenocorticotropin secretion, and is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at other sites in the central nervous system. In non-mammalian vertebrates, CRH not only acts as a neurotransmitter and hypophysiotropin, it also acts as a potent thyrotropin-releasing factor, allowing CRH to regulate both the adrenal and thyroid axes, especially in development. CRH-BP is thought to play an inhibitory role in which it binds CRH and other CRH-like ligands and prevents the activation of CRH receptors. There is however evidence that CRH-BP may also exhibit diverse extra and intracellular roles in a cell specific fashion and at specific times in development [[cite:PUB00011280]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF009279" "Corticotropin-releasing factor binding protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR10278" "CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING FACTOR-BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Corticotropin-releasing factor-binding protein", "short" "CRF-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 811, "taxa" 3252, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1429, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1420, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 990}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008435", :literature {"PUB00011280" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Seasholtz AF" "Valverde RA" "Denver RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
