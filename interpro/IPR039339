{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TEX14 is an inactive serine/threonine-protein kinase because the active site aspartic acid residue has been replaced.  It localizes to germ cell intercellular bridges during spermatogenesis. In germ cell cytokinesis a permanent intercellular bridge connecting the daughter cells through a large cytoplasmic channel forms, unlike in somatic cells.  This bridge does not form in TEX14 deficient mice and male mice are sterile [[cite:PUB00089463]]; female knockout mice are fertile [[cite:PUB00089464]].  TEX14 binds to CEP55, which is a stable component of the intercellular bridge, via a GPPX3Y motif and preventing proteins with a similar motif (such as ALIX and TSG101) from binding to CEP55 [[cite:PUB00089465]]. During mitosis, TEX14 is recruited to kinetochores by Plk1 and without TEX14, kinetochores are unable to bind other essential components leading to chromosome instability.  Phosphorylation of TEX14 by Plk1 leads to its degradation, which is essential for metaphase-to-anaphase transition and chromosome segregation [[cite:PUB00089466]].  TEX14 contains ankyrin repeat-containing domains and a protein kinase domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23060" "TESTIS EXPRESSED GENE 14"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inactive serine/threonine-protein kinase TEX14", "short" "Tex14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 513, "taxa" 2021, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1277, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1277, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 399}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039339", :literature {"PUB00089463" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Greenbaum MP" "Yan W" "Wu MH" "Lin YN" "Agno JE" "Sharma M" "Braun RE" "Rajkovic A" "Matzuk MM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
