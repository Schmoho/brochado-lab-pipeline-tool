{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes TESPA1, ITPRID1 (also known CCDC129) and ITPRID2 (also known as SSFA2).</p>\n\n<p>SSFA2, also known as Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein (KRAP), interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R, also known as ITPR) [[cite:PUB00060892]]. SSFA2 was first localised as a membrane-bound form with extracellular regions suggesting it might be involved in the regulation of filamentous actin and signals from the outside of the cells [[cite:PUB00060892]]. It has now been shown to be critical for the proper subcellular localisation and function of IP3R. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor functions as the Ca2+ release channel on specialised endoplasmic reticulum membranes, so the subcellular localisation of IP3R is crucial for its proper function [[cite:PUB00069998]].</p>\n\n<p>TESPA1 (Thymocyte-expressed positive selection-associated protein 1) is required for the development and maturation of T-cells, its function being essential for the late stages of thymocyte development. It plays a role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of the ERK and NFAT signaling pathways, possibly by serving as a scaffolding protein that promotes the assembly of the LAT signalosome in thymocytes [[cite:PUB00068025]]. TESPA1 shows sequence homology to SSFA2 and physically associates with IP3R in T and B lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00069999]].</p>\n\n<p>The function of ITPRID1 is not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17469" "SPERM SPECIFIC ANTIGEN 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein TESPA1-like", "short" "TESPA1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 799, "taxa" 3164, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3078, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3078, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1731}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043444", :literature {"PUB00069999" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Matsuzaki H" "Fujimoto T" "Ota T" "Ogawa M" "Tsunoda T" "Doi K" "Hamabashiri M" "Tanaka M" "Shirasawa S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Open Bio", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fob.2012.08.005", "medline_journal" "FEBS Open Bio", "title" "Tespa1 is a novel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding protein in T and B lymphocytes.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "255-9", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23650607}, "PUB00068025" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wang D" "Zheng M" "Lei L" "Ji J" "Yao Y" "Qiu Y" "Ma L" "Lou J" "Ouyang C" "Zhang X" "He Y" "Chi J" "Wang L" "Kuang Y" "Wang J" "Cao X" "Lu L."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
