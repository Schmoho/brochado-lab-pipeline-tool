{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial virulence proteins, including EspG from Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia coli and VirA from Shigella flexneri. Both EspG and VirA are delivered into infected host epithelial cells by a type III secretory system [[cite:PUB00012887], [cite:PUB00043282]]. These proteins function through the disruption of the host cell microtubule network [[cite:PUB00043283]]. VirA acts as a cysteine protease ([ec:3.4.22]) on alpha-tubulin, a major component of microtubules, in order to destabilise surrounding microtubules and invade the cytoplasm of their target host cells [[cite:PUB00043284]]. VirA also promotes the formation of membrane ruffles through the activation of host rac1, which is associated with the destruction of microtubule networks [[cite:PUB00043285]]. In this way, VirA creates a tunnel inside the host cell cytoplasm by breaking down the microtubule infrastructure, which facilitates the bacterium's movement through the cytoplasm and also helps other bacteria move faster during the invasion of the eukaryotic cell.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3q1c", "name" "Structure of EspG Protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043098", "name" "Cysteine protease, VirA/EspG, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06872" "EspG protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011515" "Microatubule degradation protein EspG/VirA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine protease, VirA/EspG", "short" "Cys_protease_VirA/EspG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 53, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 82, "sets" 0, "proteins" 82, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 65}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
