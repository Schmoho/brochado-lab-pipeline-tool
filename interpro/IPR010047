{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the Ni-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) family ([ec:1.2.99.2]). These enzymes reversibly oxidise CO to CO(2), and play key roles in the energy-yielding pathways of various autotrophic anaerobes, allowing these organisms to grow with CO as the sole carbon source [[cite:PUB00015143]]. The active sites of these enzymes contain Ni-iron-sulphur (NiFeS) clusters. This family also includes the CODH subunit of bifunctional CODH/acetyl-CoA synthetase (CODH/ACS), which contains two Ni-containing active sites to catalyse the formation of acetyl-CoA from CO(2)-derived CO [[cite:PUB00015141], [cite:PUB00015142]].</p>\r\n<p>CODH is related to hybrid cluster proteins (HCP, or prismane) ([interpro:IPR010048]), a complex whose activity is not yet fully described; the hybrid Fe-S cluster in HCPs is similar to the NiFeS cluster in CODH [[cite:PUB00015144]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7b7q", "name" "CooS-V with oxidized hybrid cluster"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011254", "name" "Prismane-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016101", "name" "CO dehydrogenase, alpha-bundle", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01915" "CODH"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005023" "Predicted carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase, beta subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01702" "anaerobic carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase catalytic subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ni-containing CO dehydrogenase", "short" "CODH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 72, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 473, "taxa" 2869, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3648, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2887}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
