{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rab proteins, a family of small Ras-related GTP-binding proteins, are involved in regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking [[cite:PUB00000785]]. Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) forms a soluble complex with Rab proteins, thereby preventing exchange of GDP for GTP. Rab GDI exists in several isoforms, and belongs to the TCD/MRS6 family of GDP dissociation inhibitors. <p>The crystal structure of the bovine alpha-isoform of Rab GDI has been determined to a resolution of 1.81A [[cite:PUB00004235]]. The protein is composed of two main structural units: a large complex multi-sheet domain I, and a smaller Î±-helical domain II.</p>\n\n<p>The structural organisation of domain I is closely related to FAD-containing monooxygenases and oxidases [[cite:PUB00004235]]. Conserved regions common to GDI and the choroideraemia gene product, which delivers Rab to catalytic subunits of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II, are clustered on one face of the domain [[cite:PUB00000785]]. The two most conserved regions form a compact structure at the apex of the molecule; site-directed mutagenesis has shown these regions to play a critical role in the binding of Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00004235]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00892" "RABGDI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab GDI protein", "short" "RabGDI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2628, "taxa" 9099, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 53923, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7143, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4568}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000806", :literature {"PUB00000785" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Nishimura N" "Goji J" "Nakamura H" "Orita S" "Takai Y" "Sano K."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/55/22/5445", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "Cloning of a brain-type isoform of human Rab GDI and its expression in human neuroblastoma cell lines and tumor specimens.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "5445-50", "volume" "55", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7585614}, "PUB00004235" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6577", "authors" ["Schalk I" "Zeng K" "Wu SK" "Stura EA" "Matteson J" "Huang M" "Tandon A" "Wilson IA" "Balch WE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/381042a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure and mutational analysis of Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "42-8", "volume" "381", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8609986}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005093", "name" "Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0015031", "name" "protein transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018203", "name" "GDP dissociation inhibitor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000806", "name" "Rab GDI protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR001738", "name" "Rab protein geranylgeranyltransferase component A", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017230", "name" "Rab geranylgeranyltransferase complex component A", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
