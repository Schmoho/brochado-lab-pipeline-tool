{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The plant augmin complex is involved in assembly of microtubules (MT) arrays during mitosis and contains eight subunits (AUG1 -AUG8). Among them, AUG1 to AUG6 share similarity with their animal counterparts, but AUG7 and AUG8 share homology only with proteins of plant origin [[cite:PUB00068102]]. AUG8 belongs to the plant QWRF motif-containing protein family, which also includes microtubule-associated protein ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE 1 [[cite:PUB00076700], [cite:PUB00076701]] and SNOWY COTYLEDON 3 [[cite:PUB00076702]]. AUG8 binds the microtubule and participates in the reorientation of microtubules in hypocotyls (the stem of a germinating seedling) [[cite:PUB00076699]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04484" "QWRF family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "QWRF family", "short" "QWRF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 89, "proteomes" 322, "taxa" 1338, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4389, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4120, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2390}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007573", :literature {"PUB00068102" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Hotta T" "Kong Z" "Ho CM" "Zeng CJ" "Horio T" "Fong S" "Vuong T" "Lee YR" "Liu B."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.112.096610", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Characterization of the Arabidopsis augmin complex uncovers its critical function in the assembly of the acentrosomal spindle and phragmoplast microtubule arrays.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1494-509", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22505726}, "PUB00076699" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Farquharson KL."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.113.250612", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "AUGMIN subunit8 participates in microtubule reorientation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1913", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23749846}, "PUB00076700" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pignocchi C" "Minns GE" "Nesi N" "Koumproglou R" "Kitsios G" "Benning C" "Lloyd CW" "Doonan JH" "Hills MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.061812", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 Is a Novel Microtubule-Associated Protein Essential for Seed Development in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "90-105", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19151224}, "PUB00076701" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Hehenberger E" "Kradolfer D" "Kohler C."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.077057", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Endosperm cellularization defines an important developmental transition for embryo development.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "2031-9", "volume" "139", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22535409}, "PUB00076702" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Albrecht V" "Simkova K" "Carrie C" "Delannoy E" "Giraud E" "Whelan J" "Small ID" "Apel K" "Badger MR" "Pogson BJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.110.074781", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The cytoskeleton and the peroxisomal-targeted snowy cotyledon3 protein are required for chloroplast development in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "3423-38", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20978221}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007573", "name" "QWRF family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 30, "alignment:full" 2540}}}
