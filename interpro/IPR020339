{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Uncharacterised protein C20orf85, also known as Ciliary microtubule inner protein 1 (CIMIP1) is part of a family found in eukaryotes. It is 137 amino acids long in protein sequence length and mass is approximately 15.7kDa. The protein is present in the normal lung epithelium, but absent or downregulated in most primary non-small lung cancers. The gene is also known as Low in Lung Cancer 1 (LLC1). This protein is thought to have a role in the maintenance of normal lung function and its absence may lead to lung tumourigenesis [[cite:PUB00069933]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14945" "Normal lung function maintenance, Low in Lung Cancer 1 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ciliary microtubule inner protein 1-like", "short" "C20orf85-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 467, "taxa" 2154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 861, "sets" 0, "proteins" 845, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 479}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020339", :literature {"PUB00069933" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Hong KM" "Yang SH" "Chowdhuri SR" "Player A" "Hames M" "Fukuoka J" "Meerzaman D" "Dracheva T" "Sun Z" "Yang P" "Jen J."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
