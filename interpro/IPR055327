{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents TNF receptor-associated factor homolog 1a/b from Arabidopsis thaliana, which function redundantly and are involved in the regulation of plant immune responses and autophagy [[cite:PUB00155354], [cite:PUB00155355]]. Members of this family contribute to the turnover of specific nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NB-LRR) immune receptors, which are crucial for recognising pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiating immune responses. They are thought to interact with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes to modulate the ubiquitination and degradation of these immune receptors, thereby maintaining their homeostasis. Additionally, these proteins function as molecular adapters in autophagy, influencing the stability of ATG6, an essential component of the autophagy machinery. Their role in autophagy also involves cooperation with SINAT1 and SINAT2 for the ubiquitination and destabilisation of ATG6, which is necessary for the proper formation of autophagosomes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47477" "TNF RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED FACTOR HOMOLOG 1A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TNF receptor-associated factor homolog 1a/b", "short" "TRAF1A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 277, "taxa" 1077, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1747, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1747, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1056}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055327", :literature {"PUB00155355" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Qi H" "Xia FN" "Xie LJ" "Yu LJ" "Chen QF" "Zhuang XH" "Wang Q" "Li F" "Jiang L" "Xie Q" "Xiao S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.17.00056", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "TRAF Family Proteins Regulate Autophagy Dynamics by Modulating AUTOPHAGY PROTEIN6 Stability in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "890-911", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28351989}, "PUB00155354" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Huang S" "Chen X" "Zhong X" "Li M" "Ao K" "Huang J" "Li X."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.005", "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "Plant TRAF Proteins Regulate NLR Immune Receptor Turnover.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "204-15", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26867179}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055327", "name" "TNF receptor-associated factor homolog 1a/b", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
