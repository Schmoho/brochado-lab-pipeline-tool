{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins from various mammals known as DEPP proteins, which are decidual proteins induced by progesterone.</p>\n\n<p>Decidualization of the endometrial stromal cells (ESC) is thought to be stimulated by progesterone and/or cAMP and is crucial for embryo implantation and placentation. Increased expression of Depp was observed in endometria during mid- and late-secretory phases and 1st trimester deciduas. Depp increased the level of phosphorylated Erk and activated the Elk-1 transcription factor in human embryonal kidney 293 cells, suggesting that Depp modulates the effects of progesterone during decidualization and in the decidua by affecting gene expression [[cite:PUB00045931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15426" "PROTEIN DEPP1"}, "pfam" {"PF15343" "Decidual protein induced by progesterone family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Decidual protein, progesterone induced", "short" "DEPP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 230, "taxa" 1014, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 405, "sets" 0, "proteins" 405, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 224}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020133", :literature {"PUB00045931" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Watanabe H" "Nonoguchi K" "Sakurai T" "Masuda T" "Itoh K" "Fujita J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
