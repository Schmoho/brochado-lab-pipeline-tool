{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ribosomal protein S6 kinase II [[cite:PUB00042703]]. This enzyme acts as a serine/threonine kinase required for the mitogen or stress-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factors CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and ATF1 (activating transcription factor-1). It plays an essential role in the control of RELA transcriptional activity in response to TNF. It directly represses transcription via phosphorylation of Ser-1 of histone H2A. It phosphorylates Ser-10 of histone H3 in response to mitogenics, stress stimuli and epidemal growth-factor (EGF), which results in the transcriptional activation of several immediate early genes, including proto-oncogenes c-fos/FOS and c-jun/JUN. It mediates the mitogen- and stress-induced phosphorylation of high mobility group protein 14 (HMG-14). It requires magnesium ions as a cofactor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000606" "Ribosomal protein S6 kinase II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal protein S6 kinase II", "short" "Ribosomal_S6_kinase_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 950, "taxa" 3778, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11322, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9933, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5694}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
