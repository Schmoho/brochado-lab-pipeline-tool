{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes proteins from fungi, plants and bacteria. Proteins in this entry contain a ferredoxin-like fold. They are predicted ferredoxins, which are iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins that may play a role in redox sensing and electron transfer [[cite:PUB00078077]]. Some members appear to have sucrolytic activity [[cite:PUB00012969]]. The putative active site of the ferredoxin-like domain of the enzyme contains two cysteines and two histidines for possible binding to iron-sulfur clusters, compared to four cysteines present in the active site of ferredoxin [[cite:PUB00012969]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two budding yeast proteins, Aim32 and Apd1, are included in this entry. Apd1 is an Fe-S protein and is involved in cellular defense against hydroxyurea [[cite:PUB00078077]]. It is required for normal localisation of actin patches in budding yeasts [[cite:PUB00033323]]. The function of Aim32 is not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03062" "TRX_Fd_Sucrase"}, "panther" {"PTHR31902" "ACTIN PATCHES DISTAL PROTEIN 1"}, "pfam" {"PF06999" "Sucrase/ferredoxin-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin-like ferredoxin", "short" "Aim32/Apd1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 120, "proteomes" 2641, "taxa" 8323, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8912, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8860, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6029}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009737", :literature {"PUB00033323" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4-5", "authors" ["Entian KD" "Schuster T" "Hegemann JH" "Becher D" "Feldmann H" "Guldener U" "Gotz R" "Hansen M" "Hollenberg CP" "Jansen G" "Kramer W" "Klein S" "Kotter P" "Kricke J" "Launhardt H" "Mannhaupt G" "Maierl A" "Meyer P" "Mewes W" "Munder T" "Niedenthal RK" "Ramezani Rad M" "Rohmer A" "Romer A" "Hinnen A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
