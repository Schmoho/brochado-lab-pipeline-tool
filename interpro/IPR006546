It induces female-specific alternative splicing of the transformer (tra) pre-mRNA by binding to the tra uridine-rich polypyrimidine tract at the non-sex-specific 3' splice site during the sex-determination process. SXL binds also to its own pre-mRNA and promotes female-specific alternative splicing [[cite:PUB00033013], [cite:PUB00083876]]. SXL contains an N-terminal Gly/Asn-rich domain that may be responsible for the protein-protein interaction, and tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that show high preference to bind single-stranded, uridine-rich target RNA transcripts [[cite:PUB00083879]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01659" "sex-lethal family splicing factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sex-lethal splicing factor", "short" "Sxl"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 139, "sets" 0, "proteins" 139, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 118}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006546", :literature {"PUB00009671" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Schutt C" "Nothiger R."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/127/4/667", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Structure, function and evolution of sex-determining systems in Dipteran insects.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "667-77", "volume" "127", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10648226}, "PUB00033013" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Crowder SM" "Kanaar R" "Rio DC" "Alber T."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
