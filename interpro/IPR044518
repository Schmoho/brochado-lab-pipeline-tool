{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs), such as  AGD11/12/13 from Arabidopsis. ArfGAPs are a family of proteins containing an ArfGAP catalytic domain that induces the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Arf, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. Of all known members belonging to the ARF-GAP protein family only AGD11, 12, and 13 possess a C2 domain enabling them to bind phospholipids, phosphoinositide and proteins in a calcium-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00096341]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46220" "ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN AGD12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein AGD11/12/13", "short" "ARF_GAP_AGD11/12/13"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 322, "taxa" 1293, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2224, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2224, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1325}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044518", :literature {"PUB00096341" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Dummer M" "Michalski C" "Essen LO" "Rath M" "Galland P" "Forreiter C."], "ISO_journal" "J Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Plant Physiol", "title" "EHB1 and AGD12, two calcium-dependent proteins affect gravitropism antagonistically in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "114-124", "volume" "206", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27728837}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005096", "name" "GTPase activator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005543", "name" "phospholipid binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044518", "name" "ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein AGD11/12/13", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
