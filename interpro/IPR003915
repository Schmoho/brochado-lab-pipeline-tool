{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are disorders characterised by large numbers of cysts distributed throughout grossly-enlarged kidneys. Cyst\ndevelopment is associated with impairment of kidney function, and ultimately kidney failure and death [[cite:PUB00004881], [cite:PUB00099174]]. Most cases of autosomal dominant PKD result from mutations in the PKD1 gene that cause premature protein termination. A second gene for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has been identified by positional cloning [[cite:PUB00007622]]. The predicted 968-amino acid sequence of the PKD2 gene product (polycystin-2) contains 6 transmembrane domains, with intracellular N- and C-termini. Polycystin-2 shares some similarity with the family of voltage-activated calcium (and sodium) channels, and contains a potential calcium-binding domain [[cite:PUB00099174]].</p>\n\n<p>Polycystin-2 is strongly expressed in ovary, foetal and adult kidney, testis, and small intestine. Polycystin-1 requires the presence of this protein for stable expression and is believed to interact with it via its C terminus. All mutations between exons 1 and 11 result in a truncated polycystin-2 that lacks a calcium-binding EF-hand domain and the cytoplasmic domains required for the interaction of polycystin-2 with polycystin-1 [[cite:PUB00007623]]. PKD2, although clinically milder than PKD1, has a deleterious impact on life expectancy.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01433" "POLYCYSTIN2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polycystic kidney disease type 2 protein", "short" "PKD_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1064, "taxa" 4516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48174, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7749, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3700}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003915", :literature {"PUB00004881" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ward CJ" "Turley H" "Ong AC" "Comley M" "Biddolph S" "Chetty R" "Ratcliffe PJ" "Gattner K" "Harris PC."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
