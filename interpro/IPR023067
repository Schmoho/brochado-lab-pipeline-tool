{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group belongs to the ferritin domain superfamily and has the ferritin-like structural fold. Ferritins constitute a broad superfamily of iron storage proteins, widespread in all domains of life [[cite:PUB00016824], [cite:PUB00016871]]. Ferritins and bacterioferritins have essentially the same architecture, assembling in a 24mer cluster to form a hollow, roughly spherical, construction. This consists of a mineral core of hydrated ferric oxide and a multi-subunit protein shell, which encloses the former and assures its solubility in an aqueous environment. Due to the absence of the C-terminal fifth helix of 24mer ferritins, members of the Dps group assemble only to dodecameric protein shells [[cite:PUB00016788]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this entry were originally discovered as stress proteins, which protect DNA against oxidative stress during nutrient starvation [[cite:PUB00001907]], hence the name Dps (DNA protection during starvation protein). Several members of the group, such as Dps from Escherichia coli, exhibit a DNA-binding activity that is at least partially linked with iron complexation [[cite:PUB00016788]]. DNA binding by these proteins was shown to suffice for protection against oxidative DNA damage and might be mediated by magnesium ions, which bridge the protein surfaces with the polyanionic DNA [[cite:PUB00016778], [cite:PUB00016848]]. Dps also contributes to defense against copper stress in growing cells of E. coli [[cite:PUB00054022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ak8", "name" "Crystal structure of the SEp22 dodecamer, a Dps-like protein from Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01441" "DNA protection during starvation protein [dps]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA protection during starvation protein, gammaproteobacteria", "short" "Dps_gammaproteobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 90, "taxa" 1064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 982, "sets" 0, "proteins" 982, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 755}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023067", :literature {"PUB00016788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Zeth K" "Offermann S" "Essen LO" "Oesterhelt D."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
