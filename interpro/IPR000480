{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutelins are major storage proteins that aggregate in protein bodies in the endosperm of Zea mays (Maize) [[cite:PUB00004575], [cite:PUB00004334]]. They comprise the second largest protein fraction in Maize endosperm [[cite:PUB00004334]] (zeins being the largest), and show sequence similarities to other cereal storage proteins, such as gliadins, glutenins, hordeins, etc. Glutelins have a well-defined structure, including an N-terminal region containing varying numbers of repeats of the sequence PPPHVL [[cite:PUB00004575]]; a Gln rich region that can be separated into 2 domains; and a Cys rich C-terminal domain that shows some regions of internal similarity. Glutelins have been shown [[cite:PUB00004334]] to exhibit structural similarity to other cereal storage proteins, including a beta-reverse turn region which forms a loose helix-like domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00211" "Glutelin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutelin", "short" "Glutelin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 209, "sets" 0, "proteins" 75, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 58}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000480", :literature {"PUB00004575" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Leite A" "de Freitas FA" "Yunes JA" "Arruda P."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/4/1604", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Nucleotide Sequence of a cDNA Clone Encoding gamma-Coixin from Coix lacryma-jobi Seeds.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "1604-1605", "volume" "97", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16668595}, "PUB00004334" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Prat S" "Cortadas J" "Puigdomenech P" "Palau J."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/13.5.1493", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Nucleic acid (cDNA) and amino acid sequences of the maize endosperm protein glutelin-2.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "1493-504", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3839076}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045735", "name" "nutrient reservoir activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000480", "name" "Glutelin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
