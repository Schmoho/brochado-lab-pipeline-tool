{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA helicases from the DEAD-box family are found in almost all organisms and have important roles in RNA metabolism, such as splicing, RNA transport, ribosome biogenesis, translation and RNA decay. They are enzymes that unwind double-stranded RNA molecules in an energy dependent fashion through the hydrolysis of NTP. DEAD-box RNA helicases belong to superfamily 2 (SF2) of helicases. As other SF1 and SF2 members they contain seven conserved motifs which are characteristic of these two superfamilies [[cite:PUB00033617]]. DEAD-box is named after the amino acids of motif II or Walker B (Mg2+-binding aspartic acid).</p>\n\n<p>SrmB is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that is involved in ribosome assembly.
