{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are found in all eukaryotes and are synthesized in a pathway that starts with the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI). This reaction is carried out by a protein complex consisting of four subunits in humans, three of which, Gpi1p, Pig-C and Pig-A, have sequence and functional counterparts in the\r\nS. cerevisiae Gpi1, Gpi2 and Gpi3 proteins, respectively [[cite:PUB00089730]].
