{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of S-type (slow current) anion channels that in Arabidopsis consists of SLAC1 (SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1, At1g12480) and SLAC1-homologue proteins 1-4 (SLAH1-4). They have in common their plasma membrane localisation, but show distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. They are distant homologues of bacterial and fungal C4-dicarboxylate transporters [[cite:PUB00071875]].</p>\n\n<p>SLAC1 is localised specifically to the plasma membrane of guard cells [[cite:PUB00071875]]. It mediates CO2 sensitivity and is essential for stomatal closure in response to various endogenous and environmental stimuli [[cite:PUB00071874], [cite:PUB00097263], [cite:PUB00097264]], such as abscisic acid, ozone, light/dark transitions, humidity change, calcium ions, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide [[cite:PUB00066754]]. It also functions as an essential negative regulator of inward potassium channels in guard cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038665", "name" "Voltage-dependent anion channel superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31269" "S-TYPE ANION CHANNEL SLAH3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-type anion channel", "short" "SLAC/SLAH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1135, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2899, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2899, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1751}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030183", :literature {"PUB00071874" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Laanemets K" "Wang YF" "Lindgren O" "Wu J" "Nishimura N" "Lee S" "Caddell D" "Merilo E" "Brosche M" "Kilk K" "Soomets U" "Kangasjarvi J" "Schroeder JI" "Kollist H."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12008", "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "Mutations in the SLAC1 anion channel slow stomatal opening and severely reduce K+ uptake channel activity via enhanced cytosolic [Ca2+] and increased Ca2+ sensitivity of K+ uptake channels.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "88-98", "volume" "197", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23126621}, "PUB00071875" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7186", "authors" ["Negi J" "Matsuda O" "Nagasawa T" "Oba Y" "Takahashi H" "Kawai-Yamada M" "Uchimiya H" "Hashimoto M" "Iba K."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06720", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "CO2 regulator SLAC1 and its homologues are essential for anion homeostasis in plant cells.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "483-6", "volume" "452", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18305482}, "PUB00066754" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7186", "authors" ["Vahisalu T" "Kollist H" "Wang YF" "Nishimura N" "Chan WY" "Valerio G" "Lamminmaki A" "Brosche M" "Moldau H" "Desikan R" "Schroeder JI" "Kangasjarvi J."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06608", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "SLAC1 is required for plant guard cell S-type anion channel function in stomatal signalling.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "487-91", "volume" "452", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18305484}, "PUB00097264" {"URL" nil, "issue" "518", "authors" ["Devireddy AR" "Zandalinas SI" "Gomez-Cadenas A" "Blumwald E" "Mittler R."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Signal", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Signal", "title" "Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf communication during light stress.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29463779}, "PUB00097263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zhang A" "Ren HM" "Tan YQ" "Qi GN" "Yao FY" "Wu GL" "Yang LW" "Hussain J" "Sun SJ" "Wang YF."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "S-type Anion Channels SLAC1 and SLAH3 Function as Essential Negative Regulators of Inward K+ Channels and Stomatal Opening in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "949-955", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27002025}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008308", "name" "voltage-gated monoatomic anion channel activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006873", "name" "intracellular monoatomic ion homeostasis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004695", "name" "Transporter protein SLAC1/Mae1/ Ssu1/TehA", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011552", "name" "Tellurite resistance protein TehA/malic acid transport protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR039264", "name" "Tellurite resistance protein TehA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR030183", "name" "S-type anion channel", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030185", "name" "Malic acid transport protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
