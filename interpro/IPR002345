{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The lipocalins are a diverse, interesting, yet poorly understood family of proteins composed, in the main, of extracellular ligand-binding proteins displaying high specificity for small hydrophobic molecules [[cite:PUB00005094]]. Functions of these proteins include transport of nutrients, control of cell regulation, pheromone transport, cryptic colouration, and the enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandins. For example, retinol-binding protein 4 transfers retinol from the stores in the liver to peripheral tissues [[cite:PUB00083135]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structures of several lipocalins have been solved and show a novel 8-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel fold well conserved within the family. Sequence similarity within the family is at a much lower level and would seem to be restricted to conserved disulphides and 3 motifs, which form a juxtaposed cluster that may act as a common cell surface receptor site [[cite:PUB00000205], [cite:PUB00005013]]. By contrast, at the more variable end of the fold are found an internal ligand binding site and a putative surface for the formation of macromolecular complexes [[cite:PUB00003448]]. The anti-parallel β-barrel fold is also exploited by the fatty acid-binding proteins, which function similarly by binding small hydrophobic molecules. Similarity at the sequence level, however, is less obvious, being confined to a single short N-terminal motif.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xst", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Human Lipocalin 15"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012674", "name" "Calycin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11430" "LIPOCALIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipocalin", "short" "Lipocalin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 280, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 858, "taxa" 3137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5711, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5711, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3601}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00187", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00187"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
