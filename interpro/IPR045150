{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes CYB561D1/2 from humans. CYB561D2 (also known as 101F6), a cytochrome b561 homologue, is a transmembrane reductase that may use ascorbate as an electron donor in the cytoplasm and transfer electrons across endoplasmic reticulum membranes to reduce monodehydro-L-ascorbate radical and iron cations Fe3  in the lumen of that compartment [[cite:PUB00098138]]. The function of CYB561D1 is not clear. This entry also includes cytochrome b561 domain-containing proteins such as At4g18260 and At2g30890 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00098139]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15422" "OS05G0565100 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane reductase CYB561D1/2", "short" "CYB561D1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2197, "taxa" 7783, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6095, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3925}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
