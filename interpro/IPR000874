{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bombesin-like peptides comprise a large family of peptides which were initially isolated from amphibian skin, where they stimulate smooth muscle contraction. They were later found to be widely distributed in mammalian neural and endocrine cells. The amphibian peptides which belong to this family are currently classified into three subfamilies [[cite:PUB00005958], [cite:PUB00005959]]; the Bombesin group, which includes bombesin and alytesin; the Ranatensin group, which includes ranatensins, litorin, and Rohdei litorin; and the Phyllolitorin group, which includes Leu(8)- and Phe(8)-phyllolitorins. In mammals and birds two categories of bombesin-like peptides are known [[cite:PUB00015298], [cite:PUB00002463]], gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which stimulates the release of gastrin as well as other gastrointestinal hormones, and neuromedin B (NMB), a neuropeptide that regulates exocrine and endocrine secretions, smooth muscle contraction, saciety, blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, and it is thought to play a role in reproduction and in different behavioral responses like stress or fear [[cite:PUB00095214], [cite:PUB00095215], [cite:PUB00101168]]. Bombesin-like peptides, like many other active peptides, are synthesized as larger protein precursors that are enzymatically converted to their mature forms. The final peptides are eight to fourteen residues long.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00257" "Bombesin-like peptides family signature"}, "panther" {"PTHR16866" "GASTRIN-RELEASING PEPTIDE"}, "pfam" {"PF02044" "Bombesin-like peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bombesin/neuromedin-B/ranatensin peptide family", "short" "Bombesin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 577, "taxa" 2163, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1425, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1425, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 930}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00230", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00230"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000874", :literature {"PUB00005958" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Erspamer V" "Erspamer GF" "Mazzanti G" "Endean R."], "ISO_journal" "Comp.
