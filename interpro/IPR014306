{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family, hydroxyisourate hydrolase, represent a distinct clade of transthyretin-related proteins. Bacterial members typically are encoded next to ureidoglycolate hydrolase and often near either xanthine dehydrogenase or xanthine/uracil permease genes and have been demonstrated to have hydroxyisourate hydrolase activity [[cite:PUB00034597]].  In eukaryotes, a clade separate from the transthyretins (a family of thyroid-hormone binding proteins) has also been shown to have HIU hydrolase activity in urate catabolizing organisms [[cite:PUB00043032]].
