{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the DVL family of proteins. In a gain-of-function genetic screen for genes that influence fruit development in Arabidopsis, DEVIL (DVL) gene was identified. DVL (also known as Small polypeptide ROTUNDIFOLIA) is a small protein and over expression of the protein results in pleiotropic phenotypes featured by shortened stature, rounder rosette leaves, clustered inflorescences, shortened pedicles, and siliques with pronged tips. DVL family is a novel class of small polypeptides and the overexpression phenotypes suggest that these polypeptides may have a role in plant development playing a role as negative regulators of cell proliferation [[cite:PUB00016535], [cite:PUB00097929], [cite:PUB00097930]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08137" "DVL family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DVL", "short" "DVL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 228, "taxa" 898, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3231, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3222, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2110}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012552", :literature {"PUB00016535" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Wen J" "Lease KA" "Walker JC."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2003.01994.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "DVL, a novel class of small polypeptides: overexpression alters Arabidopsis development.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "668-77", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14871303}, "PUB00097929" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Guo P" "Yoshimura A" "Ishikawa N" "Yamaguchi T" "Guo Y" "Tsukaya H."], "ISO_journal" "J Plant Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Plant Res", "title" "Comparative analysis of the RTFL peptide family on the control of plant organogenesis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "497-510", "volume" "128", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25701405}, "PUB00097930" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Valdivia ER" "Chevalier D" "Sampedro J" "Taylor I" "Niederhuth CE" "Walker JC."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "DVL genes play a role in the coordination of socket cell recruitment and differentiation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1405-12", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22112938}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008285", "name" "negative regulation of cell population proliferation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012552", "name" "DVL", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 31, "alignment:full" 1832}}}
