{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The nucleotide sequence of the RNA of Potato leafroll virus (PLrV) has been determined [[cite:PUB00001567], [cite:PUB00003126]]. The sequence contains six large ORFs. The 3' coding region encodes three polypeptides: a 23K coat protein, a 17K polypeptide encoded in a different frame, and a 53K polypeptide, immediately following the coat protein sequence in the same frame. It has been suggested that the 53K polypeptide is translated by readthrough of the amber termination codon of the coat protein gene. The amino acid sequences encoded within the 3' region show many similarities to analogous polypeptides of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), and Beet western yellows virus (BWYV). It is possible that the ORF5 protein is a VPG-precursor from which, at the onset of RNA synthesis, the VPG molecule is released, in a similar fashion to that proposed for Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01659" "Luteovirus putative VPg genome linked protein"}, "prints" {"PR00912" "LVIRUSORF5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Luteovirus VPG protein", "short" "Luteo_VPG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 169, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2727, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1573, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001964", :literature {"PUB00001567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["van der Wilk F" "Huisman MJ" "Cornelissen BJ" "Huttinga H" "Goldbach R."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(89)80190-5", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Nucleotide sequence and organization of potato leafroll virus genomic RNA.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "51-6", "volume" "245", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2466700}, "PUB00003126" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Mayo MA" "Robinson DJ" "Jolly CA" "Hyman L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
