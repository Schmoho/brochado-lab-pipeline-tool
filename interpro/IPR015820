{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ty are yeast transposons. A 5.7kb transcript codes for p3 a fusion protein of TYA and TYB. The TYA protein is analogous to the gag protein of retroviruses. TYA a is cleaved to form 46kd protein which can form mature virion like particles [[cite:PUB00003533]]. This entry corresponds to the capsid protein from Ty1 and Ty2 transposons.</p>\n\n<p>Yeast retrotransposon Ty1 produces its proteins as precursors that are subsequently cleaved by an aspartic protease encoded by the element. Cleavage of the gag and gag-Pol polyprotein precursors is a critical step in proliferation of retroviruses and retroelements. These cleavage events are essential for transposition as they release the active reverse transcriptase and integrase and they modify the structure of the virus-like particles in a way that is analogous to the morphological changes that occur during retrovirus core maturation [[cite:PUB00003533], [cite:PUB00011886], [cite:PUB00011887]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01021" "Ty transposon capsid protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ty transposon capsid protein", "short" "TYA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 114, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 226, "sets" 0, "proteins" 223, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 184}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
