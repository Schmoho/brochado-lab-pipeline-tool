{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents tRNA (guanine-N-7) methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.33]) mainly from bacteria, which catalyses the formation of N(7)-methylguanine at position 46 (m7G46) in tRNA. Capping of the pre-mRNA 5' end by addition a monomethylated guanosine cap (m(7)G) is an essential and the earliest modification in the biogenesis of mRNA [[cite:PUB00044795]]. The reaction is catalysed by three enzymes: triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and tRNA (guanine-N-7) methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00017356], [cite:PUB00043301]]. This entry includes Bacillus subtilis TrmB, which contains a unique variant of the Rossmann-fold methyltransferase (RFM) structure, with the N-terminal helix folded on the opposite site of the catalytic domain [[cite:PUB00040616]]. This entry also includes the bifunctional methyltransferase RFTRM from Rickettsia, in which this activity is found at the C-terminal.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7nzj", "name" "Structure of bsTrmB apo"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01057" "tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase [trmB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase TrmB, bacteria", "short" "tRNA_methyltr_TrmB_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8157, "taxa" 30419, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32617, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24981}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
