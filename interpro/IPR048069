{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are found mainly in cyanobacteria and show significant similarity to proteins belonging to Thioredoxin-like superfamily ([interpro:IPR036249]). However, the core region of the protein family alignment shows either one Cys residue or none, suggesting that these proteins may share the thioredoxin-like fold but lack redox capability. The founding member of the family, slr1796 ([swissprot:P72804]), proteomics analysis demonstrated that it localises to the thylakoid membrane, consistent with taxonomic restriction to cyanobacteria. Targeted mutagenesis of slr1796 suggested a role at post transcriptional level and in the insertion of photosystem I proteins into the thylakoid membrane [[cite:PUB00105560]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038096" "thylakoid membrane photosystem I accumulation factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thylakoid membrane accumulation factor slr1796", "short" "Thylak_slr1796"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 199, "taxa" 1225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 743, "sets" 0, "proteins" 743, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 531}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048069", :literature {"PUB00105560" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Zhu Y" "Liberton M" "Pakrasi HB."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "A Novel Redoxin in the Thylakoid Membrane Regulates the Titer of Photosystem I.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "18689-99", "volume" "291", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27382055}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048069", "name" "Thylakoid membrane accumulation factor slr1796", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
