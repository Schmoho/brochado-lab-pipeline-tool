{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UL20 is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with multiple membrane spans. It is involved in the trans-cellular transport of enveloped virions, and is therefore important for viral egress. However, UL20 operates in different cellular compartments and different stages of egress in Suid herpesvirus 1 (Pseudorabies virus) and herpes simplex virus. This is thought to be due to differences in egress pathways between these two viruses [[cite:PUB00010047]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04544" "Herpesvirus egress protein UL20"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL20, egress protein", "short" "Herpes_UL20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 161, "sets" 0, "proteins" 161, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007629", :literature {"PUB00010047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Fuchs W" "Klupp BG" "Granzow H" "Mettenleiter TC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
