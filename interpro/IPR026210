Based on shell morphology, they are traditionally divided into 3 groups: cone snails, augers and turrids. Most molluscan taxonomies assign cone snails to a single large genus, Conus, while augers are assigned to several different genera; by contrast, the turrids represent a group that is much more diverse, and is now thought to comprise the vast majority of conoidean biodiversity [[cite:PUB00060221]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The venom peptides from several species in the genus Gemmula, the gem turrids, have been characterised. Their translated open reading frames show characteristics typical of the venom peptides from Conus: an N-terminal signal sequence; a C-terminal cysteine-rich mature peptide; and an intervening pro-region. Two of these sequences, Gsp9.1 and Gsp9.2, have highly similar signal and propeptide regions, while their predicted mature peptides are more divergent (although the cysteine residues are completely conserved) [[cite:PUB00060221]]. This pattern of highly conserved and more variable regions is characteristic of gene superfamilies encoding the toxin peptides found in Conus venoms.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02080" "Toxin Pg family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin Pg family", "short" "Toxin_Pg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 23, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026210", :literature {"PUB00060221" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Heralde FM 3rd" "Imperial J" "Bandyopadhyay PK" "Olivera BM" "Concepcion GP" "Santos AD."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2007.12.022", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "A rapidly diverging superfamily of peptide toxins in venomous Gemmula species.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "890-7", "volume" "51", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18272193}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026210", "name" "Toxin Pg family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
