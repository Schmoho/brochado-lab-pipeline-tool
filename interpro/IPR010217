{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 5, organellar chromatophore 2 (NU5C2 or NdhF2). Proteins in this entry are mainly found in Cyanobacteria. These enzymes are responsible for the following reaction:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>plastoquinone + H<sup>+</sup> + NADPH = plastoquinol + H<sup>+</sup> + NADP+ </reaction></p>\n\n<p>It is restricted to two paralogs in each completed cyanobacterial genome, in which several subtypes of ndhF are found. Included in this family is NdhF3, shown to play a role in high-affinity CO2 uptake in Synechococcus sp. (strain PCC 7002) (Agmenellum quadruplicatum). In all cases, neighbouring genes include a paralog of ndhD but do include other NAD(P)H dehydrogenase subunits. Instead, genes related to C02 uptake tend to be found nearby [[cite:PUB00013515]].</p>\n\n<p>In the amoeba Paulinella chromatophora, which carries an endosymbiotic cyanobacterium, more than 30 cyanobacterial genes have moved to its cell nucleus [[cite:PUB00099652]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01960" "NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, subunit NdhF3 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 5, organellar chromatophore 2", "short" "NU5C2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 198, "taxa" 1207, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1238, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1238, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 859}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
