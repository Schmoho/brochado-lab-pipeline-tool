{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several variants of the human and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) sperm antigen proteins (HE2 and EP2 respectively). The EP2 gene codes for a family of androgen-dependent, epididymis-specific secretory proteins, known as sperm-associated antigen 11. The EP2 gene uses alternative promoters and differential splicing to produce a family of variant messages. The translated putative protein variants differ significantly from each other. Some of these putative proteins have similarity to beta-defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides [[cite:PUB00010486]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14081" "SPERM-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN 11A-RELATED-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF05324" "Sperm antigen HE2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sperm-associated antigen 11 A/B", "short" "Sperm_Ag_11A_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 108, "taxa" 403, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 337, "sets" 0, "proteins" 333, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 242}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007988", :literature {"PUB00010486" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Frohlich O" "Po C" "Murphy T" "Young LG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
