{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) forms a family with other growth factors. The receptors for most of the members of this growth factor family are related.

The C-terminal part of the extracellular domain is conserved. Some of the receptors of this family contain subclass-specific N-terminal extensions of this homology domain.
