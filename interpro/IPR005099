{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This non-structural protein is one of two found in pneumoviruses. The protein is about 140 amino acids in length. The NS1 protein appears to be important for efficient replication but not essential [[cite:PUB00007731]]. The NS1 protein has been shown by yeast two-hybrid to interact with the viral P protein [[cite:PUB00007732]]. This protein is also known as the 1C protein. It has also been shown that NS1 can potently inhibit transcription and RNA replication [[cite:PUB00007733]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03438" "Pneumovirus NS1 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pneumovirus NS1 protein", "short" "Pneumo_NS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 37, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 460, "sets" 0, "proteins" 459, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005099", :literature {"PUB00007731" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Teng MN" "Whitehead SS" "Bermingham A" "St Claire M" "Elkins WR" "Murphy BR" "Collins PL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
