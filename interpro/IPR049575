{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the anti-sigma factor RsiG from actinomycetes. RsiG binds and sequesters the sporulation-specific sigma factor WhiG in a fashion dependent on 3',5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP). RsiG can bind the cyclic dinucleotide in the absence of sigma factor WhiG, and does so in a specific manner via a unique signature conserved in all Streptomyces. This gene was originally named amfC (aerial mycelium formation protein) but no specific role was established, and was later renamed rsiG (regulator of sigma WhiG) [[cite:PUB00145669], [cite:PUB00145670], [cite:PUB00145671]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21107" "anti-sigma factor RsiG (AmfC)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-sigma factor RsiG/AmfC-like", "short" "RsiG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 555, "taxa" 1649, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1677, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1199}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049575", :literature {"PUB00145669" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gallagher KA" "Schumacher MA" "Bush MJ" "Bibb MJ" "Chandra G" "Holmes NA" "Zeng W" "Henderson M" "Zhang H" "Findlay KC" "Brennan RG" "Buttner MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "c-di-GMP Arms an Anti-Ïƒ to Control Progression of Multicellular Differentiation in Streptomyces.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "586-599.e6", "volume" "77", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31810759}, "PUB00145670" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yonekawa T" "Ohnishi Y" "Horinouchi S."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Involvement of amfC in physiological and morphological development in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "2273-2280", "volume" "145 ( Pt 9)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10517580}, "PUB00145671" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Kudo N" "Kimura M" "Beppu T" "Horinouchi S."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Cloning and characterization of a gene involved in aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "6401-10", "volume" "177", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7592414}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049575", "name" "Anti-sigma factor RsiG/AmfC-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
