{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Herpesviruses have been implicated as a cause of tumours in a number of species. The common tumour condition of the fowl is caused by Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 (MeHV-1). Although infection is ubiquitous, only a proportion of fowl develop tumours, and the precise details of the process of tumour induction remains to be elucidated. Secretory glycoprotein GP57-65 precursor (glycoprotein A - GA) is thought to play an immunoevasive role in the pathogenesis of Marek's disease. It is a candidate for causing the early-stage immunosuppression that occurs after MDHV infection. The protein is predominantly secreted, but a small amount of mature GP57-65 is anchored in the plasma membrane, or held by other interactions. GA is similar to Herpesvirus glycoprotein C, and belongs to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily [[cite:PUB00003483], [cite:PUB00005634]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00675" "MAREKSGPA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Marek's disease glycoprotein A", "short" "Marek_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 25, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 216, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001654", :literature {"PUB00003483" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Coussens PM" "Velicer LF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
