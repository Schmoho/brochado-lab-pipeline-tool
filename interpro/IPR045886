{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of E1-like enzymes that contain the NAD/FAD-binding fold [[cite:PUB00079807]]. Proteins in this entry include ThiF/MoeB/HesA from bacteria and E1-like enzymes from eukaryotes.</p>\n\n<p>ThiF/MoeB/HesA are involved in molybdopterin and thiamine biosynthesis. The common reaction mechanism catalysed by MoeB and ThiF, like other E1 enzymes, begins with a nucleophilic attack of the C-terminal carboxylate of MoaD and ThiS, respectively, on the alpha-phosphate of an ATP molecule bound at the active site of the activating enzymes, leading to the formation of a high-energy acyladenylate intermediate and subsequently to the formation of a thiocarboxylate at the C termini of MoaD and ThiS. MoeB, as the MPT synthase (MoaE/MoaD complex) sulfurase, is involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, a derivative of the tricyclic pterin, molybdopterin (MPT) [[cite:PUB00011756]]. ThiF catalyses the adenylation of ThiS, as part of the biosynthesis pathway of thiamin pyrophosphate (vitamin B1) [[cite:PUB00099202]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4d7a", "name" "Crystal structure of E. coli tRNA N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine dehydratase, TcdA, in complex with AMP at 1.801 Angstroem resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035985", "name" "Ubiquitin-activating enzyme", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023318", "name" "Ubiquitin activating enzyme, alpha domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43267" "TRNA THREONYLCARBAMOYLADENOSINE DEHYDRATASE", "PTHR10953" "UBIQUITIN-ACTIVATING ENZYME E1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ThiF/MoeB/HesA family", "short" "ThiF/MoeB/HesA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 111, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11471, "taxa" 45972, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 117172, "sets" 0, "proteins" 117172, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83065}, "pathways" 177}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
