{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes acetyltransferases such as N-acetyltransferase 9 (NAT9).  The NAT9 gene is an important reproduction related gene and is associated with psoriatic arthritis [[cite:PUB00088976]] and possibly with Crohn's disease [[cite:PUB00088977]]. NAT9 contains a GNAT domain and mediates the acetylation of the N-terminal residues of alpha- and beta-tubulin. It is required for microtubule stability and regulation of JNK signalling to promote cell survival during developmental stages [[cite:PUB00100222]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ovu", "name" "Crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana NAT9 in complex with AcCoA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13256" "N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE 9"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetyltransferase 9-like", "short" "NAT9-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2215, "taxa" 7652, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3801, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3801, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2529}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
