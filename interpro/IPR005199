Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a key role in the self- assembly, insolubility and barrier properties of basement membranes and extracellular matrices. Hence, cleavage of heparan sulphate (HS) affects the integrity and functional state of tissues and thereby fundamental normal and pathological phenomena involving cell migration and response to changes in the extracellular microenvironment. Heparanase degrades HS at specific intrachain sites. The enzyme is synthesized as a latent approximately 65kDa protein that is processed at the N terminus into a highly active approximately 50kDa form. Experimental evidence suggests that heparanase may facilitate both tumor cell invasion and neovascularization, both critical steps in cancer progression. The enzyme is also involved in cell migration associated with inflammation and autoimmunity [[cite:PUB00008371]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7eyo", "name" "Crystal structure of leech hyaluronidase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03662" "Glycosyl hydrolase family 79, N-terminal domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 79", "short" "Glyco_hydro_79"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 109, "proteomes" 1149, "taxa" 4851, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6189, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5832, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3485}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GH79", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GH79.html"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
