{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MBOAT (membrane bound O-acyl transferase) family of membrane proteins contains a variety of acyltransferase enzymes. A conserved histidine has been suggested to be the active site residue [[cite:PUB00007478]]. The structure of MBOAT has been revealed [[cite:PUB00095085]].</p>\n\n<p>This family includes Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 7 (MBOAT7) from humans. DGAT1 catalyses the terminal and only committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis by using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates [[cite:PUB00099655]]. It also functions as the major acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) in the skin, where it acts to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid toxicity leading to skin and hair disorders [[cite:PUB00099655]]. MBOAT7 participates in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism through the phosphatidylinositol acyl-chain remodeling regulation [[cite:PUB00099654]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03062" "MBOAT, membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane bound O-acyl transferase, MBOAT", "short" "MBOAT_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 372, "proteomes" 6053, "taxa" 24532, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 56025, "sets" 0, "proteins" 55551, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 37801}, "pathways" 291}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1316", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1316"} {"accession" "GenProp1575", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1575"} {"accession" "GenProp1558", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1558"} {"accession" "GenProp1718", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1718"} {"accession" "GenProp1761", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1761"} {"accession" "GenProp1398", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1398"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
