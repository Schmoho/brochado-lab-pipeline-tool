{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a highly conserved set of proteins which contains three pairs of cysteine residues within a length of 42 amino acids and is rich in proline residues towards the N terminus. It includes a membrane protein that has been found to be highly expressed in the mouse brain and consequently, several members have been assigned as BRI3 or brain protein i3 [[cite:PUB00083183]]. Their function is unknown but they appear to play a role in TNF-induced cell death [[cite:PUB00095376]]. They may be a target of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in the liver [[cite:PUB00151123]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10164" "Brain protein I3"}, "panther" {"PTHR13551" "BRAIN PROTEIN I3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane protein BRI3", "short" "BRI3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 1034, "taxa" 4006, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1855, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1848, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1186}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019317", :literature {"PUB00151123" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kavak E" "Najafov A" "Ozturk N" "Seker T" "Cavusoglu K" "Aslan T" "Duru AD" "Saygili T" "Hoxhaj G" "Hiz MC" "Unal DO" "Birgul-Iyison N" "Ozturk M" "Koman A."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Signal", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Signal", "title" "Analysis of the Wnt/B-catenin/TCF4 pathway using SAGE, genome-wide microarray and promoter analysis: Identification of BRI3 and HSF2 as novel targets.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1523-35", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20538055}, "PUB00083183" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Vidal R" "Calero M" "Revesz T" "Plant G" "Ghiso J" "Frangione B."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00374-2", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Sequence, genomic structure and tissue expression of Human BRI3, a member of the BRI gene family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "95-102", "volume" "266", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11290423}, "PUB00095376" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wu H" "Liu G" "Li C" "Zhao S."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
