{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The accumulation of abnormal membrane proteins is something which must be avoided in order to maintain cell viability. In Escherichia coli, the membrane-bound, ATP-dependent protease FtsH plays a central role in the degradation of these abnormal proteins [[cite:PUB00033396]]. Known substrates of this protease include several lambda bacteriophage proteins, the heat-shock transcription factor sigma-32, and the unassembled form of the membrane protein SecY. While FtsH is active as a protease on its own, in vivo it forms a complex with a membrane-bound HflKC heterodimer. HflKC has a generally inhibitory effect on the protease activity of FtsH, though the mechanism of this inhibition is not known. HflK is a member of peptidase inhibitor family I87 [[cite:PUB00081322]].  The HflK and HflC polypeptides are paralogous, and often encoded by tandem genes within bacterial genomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the HflK subunit (MEROPS identifier I87.002) of the HflKC heterodimer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03404" "High frequency of lysogenization K (HflK) family; SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) superfamily"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01933" "FtsH protease activity modulator HflK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HflK", "short" "HflK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3767, "taxa" 15139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19445, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19443, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14907}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0684", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0684"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010201", :literature {"PUB00081322" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Rawlings ND."], "ISO_journal" "Biochimie", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2010.04.013", "medline_journal" "Biochimie", "title" "Peptidase inhibitors in the MEROPS database.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1463-83", "volume" "92", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20430064}, "PUB00033396" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ito K" "Akiyama Y."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
