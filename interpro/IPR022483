PSB is a component of the proteasome core, a large protease complex with broad specificity involved in protein degradation. In  Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the proteasome is able to cleave oligopeptides not only after hydrophobic but also after basic, acidic and small neutral residues [[cite:PUB00100068]]. In complex with the ATPase Mpa, it degrades protein targets conjugated to a prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) [[cite:PUB00100067]]. It is essential for persistence of the pathogen during the chronic phase of infection in the host [[cite:PUB00100066], [cite:PUB00100065]] and may also function to recycle amino acids under nutrient starvation, thereby enabling the cell to maintain basal metabolic activities [[cite:PUB00100063]]. It has been related to the resistance of this bacteria to antimicrobial antifolates via regulating both folate reduction and cytokinin production [[cite:PUB00100064]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this protein family are threonine peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family T1 (clan PB(T)), subfamily T1A.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jay", "name" "Proteasome beta subunit PrcB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029055", "name" "Nucleophile aminohydrolases, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03690" "proteasome subunit beta"}, "hamap" {"MF_02113_B" "Proteasome subunit beta [prcB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasome subunit beta, actinobacteria", "short" "PSB_actinobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 34, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1392, "taxa" 4048, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3475}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0834", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0834"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
