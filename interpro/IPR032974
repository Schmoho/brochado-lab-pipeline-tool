{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dolichol kinase catalyses the CTP-mediated phosphorylation of dolichol in eukaryotic cells, the terminal step in dolichyl monophosphate (Dol-P) biosynthesis de novo. Dol-P serves as a glycosyl carrier lipid in the assembly of N-linked glycoproteins, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, and the C- and O-mannosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of yeast and animal cells [[cite:PUB00077298], [cite:PUB00060653], [cite:PUB00060652]]. Phytol kinase catalyses the CTP-dependent phosphorylation of phytol to phytylmonophosphate (PMP) and has a role in tocopherol biosynthesis in plants [[cite:PUB00077299], [cite:PUB00077300]].
