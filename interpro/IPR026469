{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this archaeal protein family resemble periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of ABC transporters and appear in gene neighbourhoods with permease and ATP-binding cassette proteins. Studies suggest that one family member ([swissprot:Q9HQ20]) is part of the ABC transporter complex BtuCDF involved in cobalamin (vitamin B12) import [[cite:PUB00060729]]. Notably, essentially all members also have the PGF-CTERM putative protein-sorting domain at the C terminus, while more distant homologues instead have what appear to be lipoprotein signal peptides at the N terminus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04281" "PGF-CTERM-anchored ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative ABC transporter PGF-CTERM-modified substrate-binding protein", "short" "Peripla_PGF_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 554, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 475, "sets" 0, "proteins" 457, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 406}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026469", :literature {"PUB00060729" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Woodson JD" "Reynolds AA" "Escalante-Semerena JC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
