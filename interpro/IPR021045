{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PB1-F2 is a protein found in almost all known strains of Influenza A virus - a negative sense ssRNA Orthomyxovirus [[cite:PUB00041456]]. It originates from translation of the viral polymerase gene in an alternative reading frame [[cite:PUB00041456]]. PB1-F2 consists of two independent structural domains, two closely neighbouring short helices at the N terminus, and an extended C-terminal helix [[cite:PUB00041456]]. Although the protein has originally been described to induce apoptosis, it has now been shown that PB1-F2 more likely acts as an apoptosis promoter in concert with other apoptosis-inducing agents [[cite:PUB00041456]]. PB1-F2 promotes apoptosis by localising to the mitochondria where it destabilises the membrane. This will cause release of cytochrome C which activates the caspase cascade of apoptosis through the endogenous pathway [[cite:PUB00041456]]. In this way it acts like the Bcl-2 protein family which are physiological apoptotic regulators in cells [[cite:PUB00041456]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11986" "Influenza A Proapoptotic protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_04064" "Protein PB1-F2 [PB1]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Influenza A proapoptotic protein PB1-F2", "short" "Flu_proapoptotic_PB1-F2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 33753, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38040, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38040, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1012", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1012"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021045", :literature {"PUB00041456" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bruns K" "Studtrucker N" "Sharma A" "Fossen T" "Mitzner D" "Eissmann A" "Tessmer U" "Roder R" "Henklein P" "Wray V" "Schubert U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
