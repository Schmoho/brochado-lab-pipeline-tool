In turn, this inhibition prevents the production of host interferon beta. Additionally, it may also interfere with host antiviral response within the nucleus. ORF4b/NS3c proteins in this subgroup are similar to the MERS-CoV ORF4b (also known as MERS-CoV 4b) which has been shown to interfere with the NF-kappaB-dependent innate immune response during infection, as well as antagonizing the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) response, which may significantly contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis [[cite:PUB00095871], [cite:PUB00095873], [cite:PUB00095872], [cite:PUB00095874]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21651" "accessory protein ORF4b, also known as non-structural protein 3c (NS3c) in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related CoV"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Non-structural protein 3c (NS3c), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related CoV", "short" "ORF4b_MERS-CoV-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 24, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 104, "sets" 0, "proteins" 104, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044321", :literature {"PUB00095871" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Matthews KL" "Coleman CM" "van der Meer Y" "Snijder EJ" "Frieman MB."], "ISO_journal" "J Gen Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Gen Virol", "title" "The ORF4b-encoded accessory proteins of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and two related bat coronaviruses localize to the nucleus and inhibit innate immune signalling.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "874-882", "volume" "95", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24443473}, "PUB00095872" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Canton J" "Fehr AR" "Fernandez-Delgado R" "Gutierrez-Alvarez FJ" "Sanchez-Aparicio MT" "Garcia-Sastre A" "Perlman S" "Enjuanes L" "Sola I."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "MERS-CoV 4b protein interferes with the NF-ÎºB-dependent innate immune response during infection.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "e1006838", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29370303}, "PUB00095873" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yang Y" "Ye F" "Zhu N" "Wang W" "Deng Y" "Zhao Z" "Tan W."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ORF4b protein inhibits type I interferon production through both cytoplasmic and nuclear targets.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "17554", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26631542}, "PUB00095874" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Tang XC" "Zhang JX" "Zhang SY" "Wang P" "Fan XH" "Li LF" "Li G" "Dong BQ" "Liu W" "Cheung CL" "Xu KM" "Song WJ" "Vijaykrishna D" "Poon LL" "Peiris JS" "Smith GJ" "Chen H" "Guan Y."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Prevalence and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats from China.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "7481-90", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16840328}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044321", "name" "Non-structural protein 3c (NS3c), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related CoV", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
