{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes archaeal proteins whose function is unclear. Some members of this entry have been described as OapB/Arvb, encoded by oapB gene which is part of the three-gene cluster oapABC (origin-associated proteins), involved in generation of extracellular vesicles (arv, archaeal vesiculating GTAse) [[cite:PUB00154442], [cite:PUB00154443]]. It has been suggested that OapB/ArvB could be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), however, further experimental research is required to confirm this [[cite:PUB00154443]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09846" "Origin-associated protein OapB"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004977" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP004977 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Origin-associated protein OapB-like", "short" "OapB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 192, "taxa" 1277, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1374, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1075}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012017", :literature {"PUB00154442" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Wolters M" "Borst A" "Pfeiffer F" "Soppa J."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnz238", "medline_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "title" "Bioinformatic and genetic characterization of three genes localized adjacent to the major replication origin of Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "fnz238", "volume" "366", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31769790}, "PUB00154443" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Mills J" "Gebhard LJ" "Schubotz F" "Shevchenko A" "Speth DR" "Liao Y" "Duggin IG" "Marchfelder A" "Erdmann S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2311321121", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Extracellular vesicle formation in <i>Euryarchaeota</i> is driven by a small GTPase.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "e2311321121", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38408251}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012017", "name" "Origin-associated protein OapB-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 18, "alignment:full" 196}}}
