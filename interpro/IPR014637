{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sorting nexins (SNXs) are a diverse group of cellular trafficking proteins that are unified by the presence of a phospholipid-binding motif, the PX domain. The ability of these proteins to bind specific phospholipids, as well as their propensity to form protein-protein complexes, points to a role for these proteins in membrane trafficking and protein sorting [[cite:PUB00010010]]. Members of this group also contain coiled-coil regions within their large C-terminal domains and a BAR domain, whose function has been defined as a dimerisation motif, as sensing and inducing membrane curvature, and/or likely to bind to small GTPases [[cite:PUB00014978]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry includes SNX5, SNX6 and SNX32 (also known as SNX6B).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNX5 contains a BAR domain that is C teminus to the PX domain. SNX5 plays a role in macropinocytosis [[cite:PUB00068947]] and in the internalisation of EGFR after EGF stimulation [[cite:PUB00068948]].</p>\r\n<p>SNX6 was found to interact with members of the transforming growth factor-beta family of receptor serine/threonine kinases. Strong heteromeric interactions were also seen among SNX1, -2, -4, and -6, suggesting the formation<i>in vivo</i>of oligomeric complexes. SNX6 is localized in the cytoplasm where it is thought to target proteins to the<i>trans</i>-Golgi network [[cite:PUB00027993]]. In addition, SNX6 was found to be translocated from the cytoplasm to nucleus by Pim-1, an oncogene product of serine/threonine kinase. This translocation is not affected by Pim-1-dependent phosphorylation, but the functional significance is unknown [[cite:PUB00027894]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036924" "Sorting nexin, Snx5/Snx6 types"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sorting nexin-5/6/32", "short" "SNX5/SNX6/SNX32"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 856, "taxa" 3470, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2792, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1732}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014637", :literature {"PUB00068947" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lim JP" "Wang JT" "Kerr MC" "Teasdale RD" "Gleeson PA."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Cell Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2121-9-58", "medline_journal" "BMC Cell Biol", "title" "A role for SNX5 in the regulation of macropinocytosis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "58", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18854019}, "PUB00068948" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Wang JT" "Kerr MC" "Karunaratne S" "Jeanes A" "Yap AS" "Teasdale RD."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013763", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The SNX-PX-BAR family in macropinocytosis: the regulation of macropinosome formation by SNX-PX-BAR proteins.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "e13763", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21048941}, "PUB00010010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Worby CA" "Dixon JE."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
