{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydroorotase belongs to MEROPS peptidase family M38 (clan MJ), where it is classified as a non-peptidase homologue. DHOase catalyses the third step in the<i>de novo</i>biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the conversion of ureidosuccinic acid (N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate) into dihydroorotate. Dihydroorotase binds a zinc ion which is required for its catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00002652]].</p>\n\n<p>In bacteria, DHOase is a dimer of identical chains of about 400 amino-acid residues (gene pyrC). In the metazoa, DHOase is part of a large multi-functional protein known as 'rudimentary' in Drosophila melanogaster and CAD in mammals and which catalyzes the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00000720]]. The DHOase domain is located in the central part of this polyprotein. In yeast, DHOase is encoded by a monofunctional protein (gene URA4). However, a defective DHOase domain [[cite:PUB00001777]] is found in a multifunctional protein (gene URA2) that catalyzes the first two steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis.</p>\n\n<p>The comparison of DHOase sequences from various sources shows [[cite:PUB00003725]] that there are two highly conserved regions. The first located in the N-terminal extremity contains two histidine residues suggested [[cite:PUB00001777]] to be involved in binding the zinc ion. The second is found in the C-terminal part. Members of this family of proteins are predicted to adopt a TIM barrel fold [[cite:PUB00004994]].</p>\n\n<p>This family represents the homodimeric form of dihydroorotase [ec:3.5.2.3]. It is found in bacteria, plants and fungi; URA4 of yeast is a member of this group of sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2z26", "name" "Thr110Ala dihydroorotase from E. coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01294" "DHOase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00219" "Dihydroorotase [pyrC]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001237" "Dihydroorotase"}, "panther" {"PTHR43137" "DIHYDROOROTASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00856" "dihydroorotase, homodimeric type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dihydroorotase homodimeric type", "short" "DHOdimr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4093, "taxa" 15519, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15074, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15031, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11260}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1427", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1427"} {"accession" "GenProp1614", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1614"} {"accession" "GenProp0187", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0187"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
