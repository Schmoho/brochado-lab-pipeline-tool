{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Epstein-Barr virus (strain GD1) (HHV-4), a human tumour DNA virus and a prominent member of gamma-herpesviruses, encodes homologues of cellular antiapoptotic viral Bcl-2 proteins BALF1 and BHRF1. They protect the virus from apoptosis in its host cell during virus synthesis [[cite:PUB00043588], [cite:PUB00043589]]. The virus infects B lymphocytes to establish a latent infection and yield proliferating, growth-transformed B cells in vitro. Bcl-2 genes are essential for the initial evasion of apoptosis which allows it to establish a latent infection or cause cellular transformation, or both [[cite:PUB00043588]].</p>\n\n<p>Bcl-2 family proteins can inhibit or induce programmed cell death in part by counteracting the activity of other BCL-2 family members. BALF1, inhibits the antiapoptotic activity of EBV BHRF1 and of KSBcl-2 in several transfected cell lines. BALF1 fails, however, to inhibit the cellular BCL-2 family member, BCL-x(L). Thus, BALF1 acts as a negative regulator of the survival function of BHRF1, similar to the counterbalance observed between cellular BCL-2 family members [[cite:PUB00012884]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06861" "BALF1 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Human herpes virus type 4, BALF1", "short" "HHV-4_BALF1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 15, "taxa" 119, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 73, "sets" 0, "proteins" 73, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010677", :literature {"PUB00012884" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bellows DS" "Howell M" "Pearson C" "Hazlewood SA" "Hardwick JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
