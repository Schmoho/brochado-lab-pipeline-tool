{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is specific for E proteins from alphacoronaviruses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins. It is conserved among Coronavirus strains. It is an integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis [[cite:PUB00094065]]. During the replication cycle, E is abundantly expressed inside the infected cell, but only a small portion is incorporated into the virus envelope. The majority of the protein participates in viral assembly and budding [[cite:PUB00094273], [cite:PUB00094274]]. It can act as a viroporin by oligomerizing after insertion in host membranes to create a hydrophilic pore that allows ion transport [[cite:PUB00085193], [cite:PUB00094121]]. Additionally, the E protein is thought to prevent M protein aggregation and induce membrane curvature [[cite:PUB00099876]].</p>\n\n<p>SARS-CoV E protein forms a Ca2+ permeable channel in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi membranes. The E protein ion channel activity alters Ca2+ homeostasis within cells boosting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to the overproduction of IL-1beta. SARS-CoV overstimulates the NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway and interacts with the cellular protein syntenin, triggering p38 MARK activation. These signalling cascades result in exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology [[cite:PUB00094077]].</p>\n\n<p>Cov E proteins have a short hydrophilic N terminus, followed by a large hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domain, and end with a long, hydrophilic C terminus, which comprises the majority of the protein. The hydrophobic region of the TM domain contains at least one predicted amphipathic Î±-helix that pentamerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes. CoV E proteins have been proposed to have at least two roles. One is related to their TM channel domain. This would be active in the secretory pathway, altering lumenal environments and rearranging secretory organelles and leading to efficient trafficking of virions. The other would be related to their extramembrane domains, particularly the C-terminal domain. This is involved in protein-protein interactions and targeting, among other roles [[cite:PUB00094065], [cite:PUB00097568], [cite:PUB00097567], [cite:PUB00097569]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04205" "Envelope small membrane protein [E]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Envelope small membrane protein, alphacoronavirus", "short" "E_protein_aCoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 232, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 477, "sets" 0, "proteins" 477, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043507", :literature {"PUB00094273" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Nieto-Torres JL" "Dediego ML" "Alvarez E" "Jimenez-Guardeno JM" "Regla-Nava JA" "Llorente M" "Kremer L" "Shuo S" "Enjuanes L."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Subcellular location and topology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus envelope protein.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "69-82", "volume" "415", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21524776}, "PUB00097568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Li Y" "Surya W" "Claudine S" "Torres J."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Structure of a conserved Golgi complex-targeting signal in coronavirus envelope proteins.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "12535-49", "volume" "289", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24668816}, "PUB00099876" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lubin JH" "Zardecki C" "Dolan EM" "Lu C" "Shen Z" "Dutta S" "Westbrook JD" "Hudson BP" "Goodsell DS" "Williams JK" "Voigt M" "Sarma V" "Xie L" "Venkatachalam T" "Arnold S" "Alfaro Alvarado LH" "Catalfano K" "Khan A" "McCarthy E" "Staggers S" "Tinsley B" "Trudeau A" "Singh J" "Whitmore L" "Zheng H" "Benedek M" "Currier J" "Dresel M" "Duvvuru A" "Dyszel B" "Fingar E" "Hennen EM" "Kirsch M" "Khan AA" "Labrie-Cleary C" "Laporte S" "Lenkeit E" "Martin K" "Orellana M" "Ortiz-Alvarez de la Campa M" "Paredes I" "Wheeler B" "Rupert A" "Sam A" "See K" "Soto Zapata S" "Craig PA" "Hall BL" "Jiang J" "Koeppe JR" "Mills SA" "Pikaart MJ" "Roberts R" "Bromberg Y" "Hoyer JS" "Duffy S" "Tischfield J" "Ruiz FX" "Arnold E" "Baum J" "Sandberg J" "Brannigan G" "Khare SD" "Burley SK."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome in three dimensions (3D) during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34580920}, "PUB00094121" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Madan V" "Garcia Mde J" "Sanz MA" "Carrasco L."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Viroporin activity of murine hepatitis virus E protein.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3607-12", "volume" "579", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15963987}, "PUB00094274" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Malik YA."], "ISO_journal" "Malays J Pathol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Malays J Pathol", "title" "Properties of Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "3-11", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32342926}, "PUB00094077" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Nieto-Torres JL" "Verdia-Baguena C" "Jimenez-Guardeno JM" "Regla-Nava JA" "Castano-Rodriguez C" "Fernandez-Delgado R" "Torres J" "Aguilella VM" "Enjuanes L."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus E protein transports calcium ions and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "330-9", "volume" "485", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26331680}, "PUB00094065" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Schoeman D" "Fielding BC."], "ISO_journal" "Virol.
