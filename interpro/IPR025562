{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tae4 is a new form of toxin-antitoxin system protein for a type VI secretion system, T6SS. T6SS has roles in interspecies interactions, as well as higher order host-infection, by injecting effector proteins into the periplasmic compartment of the recipient cells of closely related species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces at least three effector proteins to other cells and thus has three specific cognate immunity proteins to protect itself. Tae4, or type VI amidase effector 4, in Enterobacter cloacae has a cognate Tai4 or type VI amidase immunity 4 protein [[cite:PUB00075621]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ijf", "name" "Crystal structure of the type VI effector-immunity complex (Tae4-Tai4) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14113" "Type VI secretion system (T6SS), amidase effector protein 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type VI secretion system (T6SS), amidase effector protein 4", "short" "Tae4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 256, "taxa" 2107, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1977, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1975, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1513}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025562", :literature {"PUB00075621" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Zhang H" "Zhang H" "Gao ZQ" "Wang WJ" "Liu GF" "Xu JH" "Su XD" "Dong YH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
