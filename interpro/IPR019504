{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family U49 (Lit peptidase, clan U-). The peptidase families associated with clan U- have an unknown catalytic mechanism as the protein fold of the active site domain and the active site residues have not been reported. The Lit peptidase from Escherichia coli functions in bacterial cell death in response to infection by Enterobacteria phage T4. Following binding of Gol peptide to domains II and III of elongation factor Tu, the Lit peptidase cleaves domain I of the elongation factor. This prevents binding of guanine nucleotides, shuts down translation and leads to cell death [[cite:PUB00063593]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10463" "Peptidase U49"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase U49, Lit peptidase", "short" "Peptidase_U49_Lit_pept"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 54, "taxa" 600, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 220, "sets" 0, "proteins" 220, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 168}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019504", :literature {"PUB00063593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Copeland NA" "Bingham R" "Georgiou T" "Cooper P" "Kleanthous C."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi0495026", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Identification of essential residues within Lit, a cell death peptidase of Escherichia coli K-12.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "7948-53", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15196039}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019504", "name" "Peptidase U49, Lit peptidase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 47}}}
