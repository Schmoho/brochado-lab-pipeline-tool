{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacteria solve the iron supply problem caused by the insolubility of Fe(3) by synthesizing iron-complexing compounds, called siderophores, and by using iron sources of their hosts, such as haem and iron bound to transferrin and lactoferrin. Escherichia coli, as an example of a Gram-negative bacterium, forms sophisticated Fe(3)-siderophore and haem transport systems across the outer membrane. IucA and IucC catalyse discrete steps in biosynthesis of the siderophore aerobactin from N epsilon-acetyl-N epsilon-hydroxylysine and citrate [[cite:PUB00009894]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes SbnC, SbnE and SbnF from Staphylococcus aureus. They are involved in staphyloferrin B biosynthesis. SbnC is a staphyloferrin B synthase. SbnE is a L-2,3-diaminopropanoate--citrate ligase. SbnF is a 2-[(L-alanin-3-ylcarbamoyl)methyl]-3-(2-aminoethylcarbamoyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate synthase [[cite:PUB00092857]].</p>\n\n<p>It also includes Bisucaberin biosynthesis protein C that is involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophore bisucaberin [[cite:PUB00154502]], as well as AnkE which is responsible of the production of NK13650 B via ligation of citrate to the ankD product [[cite:PUB00154503]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nl2", "name" "Apo NIS synthetase DesD variant R306Q"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043032", "name" "PvsD/AcsD-like, thumb domain, helical bundle", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043033", "name" "PvsD/AcsD-like, thumb domain, four stranded beta-sheet", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043045", "name" "PvsD/AcsD-like, palm domain, helix bundle", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34384" "L-2,3-DIAMINOPROPANOATE--CITRATE LIGASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aerobactin siderophore biosynthesis, IucA/IucC-like", "short" "LucA/IucC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1969, "taxa" 7937, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11194}, "pathways" 240}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
