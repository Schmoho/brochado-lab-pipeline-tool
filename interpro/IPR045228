{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Arabidopsis thaliana AtGpp1 and AtGpp2, human pseudouridine-5'-phosphatase PUDP, the orthologue in Drosophila GS1-like protein (Dmel\\Gs1l) [[cite:PUB00098319]]. AtGpp1 and AtGpp2 are constitutively expressed in all the Arabidopsis tissues and unaffected under abiotic stress. Overexpression of AtGpp2 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants increases the specific DL-glycerol-3-phosphatase activity and improves the plants tolerance to salt, osmotic and oxidative stress [[cite:PUB00098317]]. PUDP dephosphorylates pseudouridine 5'-phosphate, a potential intermediate in rRNA degradation [[cite:PUB00098318]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3l5k", "name" "The crystal structure of human Haloacid Dehalogenase-like Hydrolase Domain containing 1A (HDHD1A)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07529" "subfamily of beta-phosphoglucomutase-like family, similar to Arabidopsis thaliana Gpp1 and Gpp2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatase Gpp1/Gpp2-like", "short" "Gpp1/Gpp2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 591, "taxa" 2629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1069, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1068, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 667}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
