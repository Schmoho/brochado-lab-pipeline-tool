{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a predicted periplasmic protein, called MoxJ or MxaJ and is required for methanol oxidation in Methylobacterium extorquens [[cite:PUB00060295]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two differing opionions suggesting the role of this protein. The first is based on the homology of MoxJ, and suggests that it is the substrate-binding protein of an ABC transporter associated with methanol oxidation. The gene is also found in genomes with and only two or three genes away from a corresponding permease and ATP-binding cassette gene pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other opinion, is that MoxJ is an accessory factor or additional subunit of methanol dehydrogenase itself [[cite:PUB00060296]]. Mutational studies show a dependence of MoxJ for the expression of the PQQ-dependent two-subunit methanol dehydrogenase (MxaF and MxaI) in Methylobacterium extorquens, possibly acting as a chaperone for enzyme assembly or a third subunit. A homologous N-terminal sequence was found in Acetobacter methanolicus as a 32Kd third subunit [[cite:PUB00060297]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is thought that MoxJ may in fact be both, a component of a periplasmic enzyme that converts methanol to formaldehyde and a component of an ABC transporter that delivers the resulting formaldehyde to the cells interior.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5sv6", "name" "Crystal structure of MxaJ from Methlophaga aminisulfidivorans MPT"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03870" "methanol oxidation system protein MoxJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methanol oxidation system protein MoxJ", "short" "Methanol_oxidation_MoxJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 123, "taxa" 454, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 317, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 270}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022455", :literature {"PUB00060295" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Anderson DJ" "Morris CJ" "Nunn DN" "Anthony C" "Lidstrom ME."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(90)90457-3", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Nucleotide sequence of the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 moxF and moxJ genes involved in methanol oxidation.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "173-6", "volume" "90", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2116368}, "PUB00060296" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Van Spanning RJ" "Wansell CW" "De Boer T" "Hazelaar MJ" "Anazawa H" "Harms N" "Oltmann LF" "Stouthamer AH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
