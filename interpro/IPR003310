{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of eukaryotic G/U mismatch-specific DNA glycosylases, including the uracil DNA glycosylase from fission yeasts and the thymine DNA glycosylase from animals. They excise the mismatched base from G:X mismatches, where X is uracil, thymine or 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU). The mammalian thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) may be involved in active DNA demethylation via the base excision repair pathway [[cite:PUB00078846], [cite:PUB00078847], [cite:PUB00078849]]. It can also act as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor [[cite:PUB00078848]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>G:U mismatches resulting from deamination of cytosine are the most common pro-mutagenic lesions occurring in DNA. Uracil is removed in a base-excision repair pathway by uracil DNA-glycosylase (UDG), which excises uracil from both single- and double-stranded DNA. The uracil DNA glycosylase family 2 consists of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) from eukaryotes and mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) from prokaryotes.</p>\n\n<p>Thymine DNA glycosylases (TDG) in eukaryotic organisms are known for their double-stranded glycosylase activity on guanine/uracil (G/U) base pairs [[cite:PUB00095804]]. In human TDG removes uracil and thymine from G:U and G:T mismatches in double-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00008091], [cite:PUB00080609]]. In E. coli MUG is highly specific to G:U mismatches but also repairs G:T mismatches at high enzyme concentration. Structural studies of E. coli MUG reveal its structural homology to UDG despite low sequence identity. It has a specific uracil-binding pocket located in a DNA-binding groove and this specificity is likely the result of a multistep lesion recognition process [[cite:PUB00008091]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5hf7", "name" "TDG enzyme-substrate complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036895", "name" "Uracil-DNA glycosylase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00584" "mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylate (mug)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G/T mismatch-specific thymine DNA glycosylasee TDG-like, eukaryotes", "short" "TDG-like_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 504, "taxa" 1639, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 775, "sets" 0, "proteins" 775, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 552}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
