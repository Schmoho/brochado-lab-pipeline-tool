{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes subunits of DNA polymerase III, specifically the delta subunit, which plays a crucial role in bacterial DNA replication. The delta subunit is involved in the assembly of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme by interacting with other subunits to facilitate the loading of the beta sliding clamp onto the DNA. This process is essential for the replication machinery to achieve high processivity during DNA synthesis. The delta subunit's interaction with the gamma subunit is particularly important for transferring the beta subunit onto the DNA [[cite:PUB00026496]]. Additionally, these proteins may exhibit 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, contributing to the proofreading function of the polymerase.</p>", "llm" true, "checked" true, "updated" true} {"text" "<p>DNA polymerase III delta (holA, [ec:2.7.7.7]) and delta prime (holB) subunits are distinct proteins encoded by separate genes. The delta prime subunit (holB) exhibits sequence homology to the tau and gamma subunits (dnaX), but the delta subunit (holA) does not demonstrate this same homology with dnaX. The delta, delta prime, gamma, chi and psi subunits form the gamma complex sub-assembly of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, which couples ATP to assemble the ring-shaped beta subunit around DNA forming a DNA sliding clamp. Both delta and delta prime are monomeric in their native state, and they bind each other tightly to form a 1:1 complex. Neither delta nor delta prime alone binds tightly to the gamma subunit [[cite:PUB00007895]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34388" "DNA POLYMERASE III SUBUNIT DELTA"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01128" "DNA polymerase III subunit delta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase III, delta subunit", "short" "DNA_polIII_delta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9113, "taxa" 35664, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46648, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35309}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0263", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0263"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
