{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DREB2A-Interacting Proteins (DRIPs) are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that act as negative regulators of the response to water stress. This family includes DRIP1, DRIP2 and the DRIP homologue (DRIPH) At3g23060 from Arabidopsis, which mediate ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the drought-induced transcriptional activator Dehydration-Responsive Element-Binding Protein 2A (DREB2A) [[cite:PUB00097032], [cite:PUB00097031], [cite:PUB00097110]]. DRIP1 and DRIP2 are functionally redundant. DREB2A regulates the expression of stress-inducible genes via the dehydration-responsive elements and requires posttranslational modification for its activation. DRIPs contain a RING finger, and a RING finger- and WD40-associated ubiquitin-like (RAWUL) domain [[cite:PUB00097032], [cite:PUB00097031]]. The RAWUL domain is responsible for the protein interaction with DREB2A.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46293" "E3 UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE DRIP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin protein ligase DRIP1-like", "short" "DRIP1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 256, "taxa" 1017, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2065, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2065, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1210}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
