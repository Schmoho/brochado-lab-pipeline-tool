{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes FIPS5 and FIPS3 from Arabidopsis, components of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex that plays a key role in pre-mRNA 3'-end formation, recognising the AAUAAA signal sequence and interacting with poly(A) polymerase and other factors to bring about cleavage and poly(A) addition. FIPS5 is an homologue of yeast Fip1, which is a subunit providing a bridge of sorts between poly(A) polymerase, other subunits of the polyadenylation apparatus, and the substrate RNA. It is an RNA-binding protein that plays an role in plant development and stress responses [[cite:PUB00097652], [cite:PUB00097653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36884" "FIP1[III]-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FIPS5/FIPS3-like", "short" "FIPS5/FIPS3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 332, "taxa" 1456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1524, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1524, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 659}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044976", :literature {"PUB00097653" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Tellez-Robledo B" "Manzano C" "Saez A" "Navarro-Neila S" "Silva-Navas J" "de Lorenzo L" "Gonzalez-Garcia MP" "Toribio R" "Hunt AG" "Baigorri R" "Casimiro I" "Brady SM" "Castellano MM" "Del Pozo JC."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The polyadenylation factor FIP1 is important for plant development and root responses to abiotic stresses.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1203-1219", "volume" "99", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31111599}, "PUB00097652" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Forbes KP" "Addepalli B" "Hunt AG."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "An Arabidopsis Fip1 homolog interacts with RNA and provides conceptual links with a number of other polyadenylation factor subunits.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "176-86", "volume" "281", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16282318}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006397", "name" "mRNA processing", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044976", "name" "FIPS5/FIPS3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
