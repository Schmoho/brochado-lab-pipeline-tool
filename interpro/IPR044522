{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of CRC domain-containing proteins, including TSO1 and TCX2/3/4 from Arabidopsis. They are are homologues of the LIN54 DNA-binding components of the mammalian DREAM complex, a protein complex responsible for the regulation of cell cycle-dependent gene expression. TSO1 has been shown to regulate meristem organization and cell division [[cite:PUB00060518], [cite:PUB00008361]]. It may transcriptionally represses MYB3R1 (a conserved cell cycle regulator), and together they coordinate cell proliferation with differentiation in shoot and root [[cite:PUB00096345]]. TCX3 (also known as SOL1) and TCX2 (also known as SOL2) have been shown to regulate fate transition and cell divisions in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage [[cite:PUB00096346]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46159" "PROTEIN TESMIN/TSO1-LIKE CXC 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CRC domain-containing protein TSO1-like", "short" "TSO1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 285, "taxa" 1295, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1506}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044522", :literature {"PUB00096345" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Wang W" "Sijacic P" "Xu P" "Lian H" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Arabidopsis TSO1 and MYB3R1 form a regulatory module to coordinate cell proliferation with differentiation in shoot and root.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "E3045-E3054", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29535223}, "PUB00096346" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Simmons AR" "Davies KA" "Wang W" "Liu Z" "Bergmann DC."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "SOL1 and SOL2 regulate fate transition and cell divisions in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "146", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30665887}, "PUB00008361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Hauser BA" "He JQ" "Park SO" "Gasser CS."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/127/10/2219", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "TSO1 is a novel protein that modulates cytokinesis and cell expansion in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2219-26", "volume" "127", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10769245}, "PUB00060518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Song JY" "Leung T" "Ehler LK" "Wang C" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Regulation of meristem organization and cell division by TSO1, an Arabidopsis gene with cysteine-rich repeats.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2207-17", "volume" "127", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10769244}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044522", "name" "CRC domain-containing protein TSO1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
