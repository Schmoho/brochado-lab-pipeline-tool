{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Citron Rho-interacting kinase (CRIK) is a dual specificity protein kinase, which catalyses the autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of exogenous substrates on both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues [[cite:PUB00035070]]. It plays an important role in the regulation of cytokinesis and the development of the central nervous system. It is required for KIF14 localization to the central spindle and mid-body. It is also a putative RHO/RAC effector that binds to the GTP-bound forms of RHO and RAC1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038145" "Citron Rho-interacting kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citron Rho-interacting kinase", "short" "Citron_Rho-interacting_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 479, "taxa" 1678, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1056, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
