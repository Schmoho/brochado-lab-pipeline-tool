{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>APP-BP1 (beta-Amyloid precursor protein binding protein 1), also known as Ula1 in yeasts, is a regulatory subunit of the E1 enzyme. Human APP-BP1 is necessary for cell cycle progression through the S-M checkpoint [[cite:PUB00073566]]. Drosophila APP-BP1  interacts antagonistically with APPL (APP-like protein) during Drosophila development [[cite:PUB00073567]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ubiquitin-like proteins (ublps) are conjugated to their targets by the sequential action of E1, E2 and often E3 enzymes. Each Ublp has a dedicated E1, or activating enzyme, that initiates its conjugation cascade. In humans the NEDD8 activating E1 enzyme is a heterodimer composed of APP-BP1 and UBA3 subunits. The ubiquitin-like protein (Ublp) NEDD8 regulates cell division, signalling and embryogenesis [[cite:PUB00032681]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035985", "name" "Ubiquitin-activating enzyme", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF039099" "NEDD8-activating enzyme E1, regulatory subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit APP-BP1", "short" "APP-BP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2263, "taxa" 7771, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4563, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4183, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2637}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030667", :literature {"PUB00073567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kim HJ" "Kim SH" "Shim SO" "Park E" "Kim C" "Kim K" "Tanouye MA" "Yim J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Differ.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.cdd.4401935", "medline_journal" "Cell Death Differ", "title" "Drosophila homolog of APP-BP1 (dAPP-BP1) interacts antagonistically with APPL during Drosophila development.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "103-15", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16628230}, "PUB00073566" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Chen Y" "McPhie DL" "Hirschberg J" "Neve RL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
