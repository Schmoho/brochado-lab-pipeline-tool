The amino acid/peptide transporter family of proteins is distinct from the ABC-type peptide transporters and was uncovered by sequence analysis of a number of recently discovered peptide transport proteins [[cite:PUB00003872]]. This family consists of bacterial proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters, although they are found in yeast, plants and animals. They function by proton symport in a 1:1 stoichiometry, which is variable in different species. Structurally, these transporters present a conserved architecture consisting of 14 transmembrane α-helices with N-terminal and C-terminal six-helix bundles connected by two transmembrane α-helices (HA and HB) [[cite:PUB00094229]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5oxo", "name" "PepTSt apo structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17346" "Dipeptide and tripeptide permease A (DtpA)-like subfamily of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00924" "oligopeptide:H+ symporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dipeptide/tripeptide permease", "short" "Dipep/tripep_permease"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 65, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3931, "taxa" 15172, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26489, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26487, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20122}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005279", :literature {"PUB00003872" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Steiner HY" "Naider F" "Becker JM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
