{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of two members, designated HmdII and HmdIII, restricted to methanogens. They are homologues of the enzyme Hmd, a H2-forming N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase. Because all three isozyme forms are present in each of the corresponding sequenced genomes, it has been suggested that HmdII and HmdIII may not exhibit Hmd activity and may have a different biological function [[cite:PUB00013473]]. Based on its ability to bind to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and tRNA, a role for HmdII has been proposed as a regulator of protein synthesis that senses intracellular methylene-H4 MPT concentration [[cite:PUB00088210]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4yt2", "name" "Hmd II from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500166" "H2-forming N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase homolog"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01724" "H2-forming N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase-related protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "H(2)-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase-related protein", "short" "HMDII/III"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 117, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 111, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 100}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010063", :literature {"PUB00088210" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Fujishiro T" "Ataka K" "Ermler U" "Shima S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.13351", "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Towards a functional identification of catalytically inactive [Fe]-hydrogenase paralogs.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "3412-23", "volume" "282", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26094576}, "PUB00013473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Afting C" "Kremmer E" "Brucker C" "Hochheimer A" "Thauer RK."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
