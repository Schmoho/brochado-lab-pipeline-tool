{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes NADH-dependent phenylglyoxylate dehydrogenase subunit epsilon (PadH) from Aromatoleum evansii, which is involved in the anaerobic metabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate. The system catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of phenylglyoxylate to benzoyl-CoA and CO2. It can also react slowly with 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate and use different electron acceptors such as benzyl viologen, methyl viologen, FAD or FMN, but NAD seems to be the physiological electron acceptor. Also catalyzes an isotope exchange between CO2 and the carboxyl group which proves partial or complete reversibility of the oxidative decarboxylation [[cite:PUB00154629]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045765" "NADH-dependent phenylglyoxylate dehydrogenase subunit epsilon"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADH-dependent phenylglyoxylate dehydrogenase subunit epsilon", "short" "PadH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 154, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 96, "sets" 0, "proteins" 96, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 73}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
