{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs), such as AGD5/15 from Arabidopsis. ArfGAPs are a family of proteins containing an ArfGAP catalytic domain that induces the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Arf, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. AGD5 (also known as EVERSHED) is localised to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it co-localises with ARF1, a crucial GTPase that is involved in membrane trafficking [[cite:PUB00096342]].  It facilitates the intracellular movement of molecules required for organ abscission and fruit growth [[cite:PUB00096343]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46419" "ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN AGD5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein AGD5/15", "short" "ARF_GAP_AGD5/15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 357, "taxa" 1549, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1751, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1751, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1033}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044520", :literature {"PUB00096343" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Gubert CM" "Liljegren SJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "title" "HAESA and HAESA-LIKE2 activate organ abscission downstream of NEVERSHED and EVERSHED in Arabidopsis flowers.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e29115", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25763490}, "PUB00096342" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Stefano G" "Renna L" "Rossi M" "Azzarello E" "Pollastri S" "Brandizzi F" "Baluska F" "Mancuso S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "AGD5 is a GTPase-activating protein at the trans-Golgi network.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "790-9", "volume" "64", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21105926}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005096", "name" "GTPase activator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044520", "name" "ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein AGD5/15", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
