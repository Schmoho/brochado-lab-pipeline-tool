{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes mutator MuT (also known as 8-oxo-dGTP diphosphatase) and similar proteins such as CTP pyrophosphohydrolase NudG from E.coli.</p>\n\n<p>MutT is a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatase converting  8-oxoguanine triphosphatase to the monophosphate with high efficiency. It acts both on 8-oxoGTP as well as 8-oxodGTP. It also can convert, less efficiently, the GDP and dGDP forms to the monophosphates [[cite:PUB00053829], [cite:PUB00053830], [cite:PUB00101991]]. Consequently it reduces the availability of 8-oxoGTP and the rate of mutation.</p>\n\n<p>NudG (also referred to as Orf135 protein), is a MutT-type enzyme that hydrolyzes 5-Me-dCTP with high activity, but also dCTP, 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP with lower activity  [[cite:PUB00101990]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ww6", "name" "Crystal structure of MutT-8-oxo-dGTP complex: Reaction for 20 min in 5 mM Mn2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47707" "8-OXO-DGTP DIPHOSPHATASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mutator MutT-like", "short" "MutT-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6260, "taxa" 24082, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28413, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28413, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21758}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
