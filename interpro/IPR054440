{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from tailed bacteriophages and bacterial prophages, including Gp32 from E217, a Pseudomonas phage used in an experimental cocktail to eradicate cystic fibrosis-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Stacked hexamers of the tail tube protein gp32 form the central tube of the E217 tail. The tail tube protein is structurally conserved and homologous to the tail tube protein gp32 found in non-contractile tails, bacterial pyocins, and type VI secretion systems. Gp32 consists of a classical β-sandwich that contains two four-stranded sheets facing each other and surrounded by a long α-helix and an extended β-turn [[cite:PUB00153918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22764" "Tail fiber protein gp32"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tail fiber protein gp32-like", "short" "Gp32-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 117, "taxa" 1081, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1032, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1032, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 395}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054440", :literature {"PUB00153918" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Li F" "Hou CD" "Lokareddy RK" "Yang R" "Forti F" "Briani F" "Cingolani G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39756-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "High-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Pseudomonas bacteriophage E217.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "4052", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37422479}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054440", "name" "Tail fiber protein gp32-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 34, "alignment:full" 135}}}
