{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacteriophage holin proteins. Holins are small membrane proteins that control the timing of host cell lysis during the phage lytic cycle. Holins typically have 2-4 transmembrane helices. The exact mechanism of how holins trigger cell lysis is not fully understood. The holin family is found in phages that infect actinobacteria, primarily mycobacteria and gordonia species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23809" "Bacteriophage holin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holin, bacteriophage", "short" "Holin_phage"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 145, "taxa" 1181, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 835, "sets" 0, "proteins" 835, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 82}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056390", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056390", "name" "Holin, bacteriophage", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 15, "alignment:full" 185}}}
