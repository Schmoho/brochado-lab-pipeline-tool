{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Metallothioneins (MT) are small proteins that bind heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, cadmium, and nickel. They have a high content of cysteine residues that bind the metal ions through clusters of thiolate bonds [[cite:PUB00003570], [cite:PUB00001490], [cite:PUB00000300]] species, including sea urchins, fungi, insects and cyanobacteria. Class III MTs are atypical polypeptides composed of gamma-glutamylcysteinyl units. This original classification system has been found to be limited, in the sense that it does not allow clear differentiation of patterns of structural similarities, either between or within classes. Consequently, all class I and class I MTs (the proteinaceous sequences) have now been grouped into families of phylogenetically-related and thus alignable sequences.</p>\n\n<p>Diptera (Drosophila, family 5) MTs are 40-43 residue proteins that contain 10 conserved cysteines arranged in five Cys-X-Cys groups. In particular, the consensus pattern C-G-x(2)-C-x-C-x(2)-Q-x(5)-C-x-C-x(2)-D-C-x-C has been found to be diagnostic of family 5 MTs. The protein is found primarily in the alimentary canal, and its induction is stimulated by ingestion of cadmium or copper [[cite:PUB00002412]]. Mercury, silver and zinc induce the protein to a lesser extent. Family 5 includes subfamilies: d1, d2. Only one d2 is known until now. Subfamilies hit the same entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02067" "Metallothionein family 5"}, "prints" {"PR00872" "MTDIPTERA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metallothionein, family 5, Diptera", "short" "Metalthion_5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 237, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 186, "sets" 0, "proteins" 164, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 140}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000966", :literature {"PUB00003570" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kagi JH."], "ISO_journal" "Meth.
