{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) constitute a family of xenobiotic- metabolising enzymes [[cite:PUB00000158]]. Using an NADPH cofactor and FAD prosthetic group, these microsomal proteins catalyse the oxygenation of nucleophilic nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorous and selenium atoms in a range of structurally diverse compounds. Five mammalian forms of FMO are now known and have been designated FMO1-FMO5 [[cite:PUB00002642], [cite:PUB00002611], [cite:PUB00004772], [cite:PUB00000516], [cite:PUB00002834]].</p>\n\n<p>The mRNA encoding FMO3 is abundant in adult liver and is also present, in low abundance, in some foetal tissues. Thus, like FMO1, FMO3 is subject to developmental and tissue-specific regulation, with a developmental switch in the expression of the genes taking place in the liver [[cite:PUB00001464]]. The deduced amino acid sequence of human FM03 includes the putative FAD- (GxGxxG) and NADP<sup>+</sup>pyrophosphate-binding (GxGxxA) sites characteristic of mammalian FMOs [[cite:PUB00000166]], a 'FATGY' motif that has also been observed in a range of siderphore biosynthetic enzymes [[cite:PUB00005489]], and a C-terminal hydrophobic segment that is believed to anchor the monooxygenase to the microsomal membrane [[cite:PUB00002549]]. Mutations in human FMO3 impair N-oxygenation of xenobiotics and are responsible for the trimethylaminuria phenotype [[cite:PUB00002004]]. Three disease-causing mutations have been identified. Nonsense and missense mutations are associated with a severe phenotype and are also implicated in impaired metabolism of other nitrogen- and sulphur-containing substrates, including biogenic amines, both clinically and when mutated proteins expressed from cDNA are studied in vitro [[cite:PUB00002004]]. Human FMO3 thus plays a critical role in the metabolism of xenobiotic substrates and endogenous amines.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01123" "FMOXYGENASE3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flavin monooxygenase (FMO) 3", "short" "Flavin_mOase_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 285, "taxa" 1007, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3044, "sets" 0, "proteins" 519, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 340}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
