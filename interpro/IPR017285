{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that play an active role in controlling nuclear cell division cycles [[cite:PUB00014103]], and regulate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins, together with the p34 (cdc2) or cdk2 kinases, form the Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF). There are two main groups of cyclins, G1/S cyclins, which are essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S (start) transition, and G2/M cyclins, which are essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G2/M (mitosis) transition. G2/M cyclins accumulate steadily during G2 and are abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase). In most species, there are multiple forms of G1 and G2 cyclins. For example, in vertebrates, there are two G2 cyclins, A and B, and at least three G1 cyclins, C, D, and E.</p>\r\n<p>Cyclin homologues have been found in various viruses, including Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 (Herpesvirus saimiri) and Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus). These viral homologues differ from their cellular counterparts in that the viral proteins have gained new functions and eliminated others to harness the cell and benefit the virus [[cite:PUB00014101]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents a viral cyclin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037816" "Viral cyclin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclin, herpesvirus", "short" "Cyclin_herpesvir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 27, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017285", :literature {"PUB00014103" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Galderisi U" "Jori FP" "Giordano A."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1206558", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Cell cycle regulation and neural differentiation.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "5208-19", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12910258}, "PUB00014101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Hardwick JM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
