{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the family of Prli42, characterized in Listeria monocytogenes and found broadly in the Firmicutes [[cite:PUB00105397], [cite:PUB00105398]]. Prli42 is a membrane protein of very small size, essential to the function of the stressosome. In L. monocytogenes, this protein is capable of activating the stressosome via direct interaction with the non-heme binding domain of RsbR. Prli42 communicates with RsbR through its N-terminal domain, which may be responsible for sensing or transmission of stress signals from the extracellular environment [[cite:PUB00105398]]. Prli42 family appears to be distantly related to DUF4044 [[interpro:IPR025270]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033880" "stressosome-associated protein Prli42"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stressosome-associated protein Prli42", "short" "Prli42-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 199, "taxa" 802, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 645, "sets" 0, "proteins" 645, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 425}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049722", :literature {"PUB00105397" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Impens F" "Rolhion N" "Radoshevich L" "Becavin C" "Duval M" "Mellin J" "Garcia Del Portillo F" "Pucciarelli MG" "Williams AH" "Cossart P."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "N-terminomics identifies Prli42 as a membrane miniprotein conserved in Firmicutes and critical for stressosome activation in Listeria monocytogenes.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "17005", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28191904}, "PUB00105398" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Williams AH" "Redzej A" "Rolhion N" "Costa TRD" "Rifflet A" "Waksman G" "Cossart P."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "The cryo-electron microscopy supramolecular structure of the bacterial stressosome unveils its mechanism of activation.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "3005", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31285450}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049722", "name" "Stressosome-associated protein Prli42", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
