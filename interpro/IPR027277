{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family includes nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase ([ec:2.4.2.19], also known as quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferases) and putative pyrophosphorylase ModD.</p>\n\n<p>Nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase is a type II phosphoribosyltransferase which provides the <i>de novo</i> source of nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) for NAD biosynthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00017199], [cite:PUB00017200]]. Human quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (also known as hQPRTase) is involved in the catabolism of quinolinic acid (QA) [[cite:PUB00047847], [cite:PUB00101112]]. Elevation of QA levels in the brain has been linked to the pathogenesis of a range of neurodegenerative disorders [[cite:PUB00063666]].</p>\n\n<p>ModD is found with molybdenum transport genes modABC in Rhodobacter capsulatus. However, disruption of modD causes only a 4-fold (rather than 500-fold for modA, modB, modC) change in the external molybdenum concentration required to suppress an alternative nitrogenase [[cite:PUB00009574]]. ModD proteins are highly similar to nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase (also called quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase).
