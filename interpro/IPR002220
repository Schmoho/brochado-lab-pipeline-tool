{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydrodipicolinate synthase ([ec:4.2.1.52]) (DHDPS, DapA) catalyses, in higher plants, some fungi and bacteria (gene dapA), the first reaction specific to the biosynthesis of lysine and of diaminopimelate [[cite:PUB00067366]]. DHDPS is responsible for the condensation of aspartate semialdehyde and pyruvate by a ping-pong mechanism in which pyruvate first binds to the enzyme by forming a Schiff-base with a lysine residue [[cite:PUB00000520], [cite:PUB00067367]].</p>\n\n<p>Other proteins are structurally related to DHDPS and probably also act via a similar catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00024869]]:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Escherichia coli N-acetylneuraminate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) (gene nanA), which catalyses the condensation of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvate to form N-acetylneuraminate.</li>\n<li>Trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase.</li>\n<li>D-4-deoxy-5-oxoglucarate dehydratase.</li>\n<li>Rhizobium meliloti protein mosA [[cite:PUB00002226]], which is involved in the biosynthesis of the rhizopine 3-o-methyl-scyllo-inosamine.</li>\n<li>Thermoproteus tenax 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate/2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase (KdgA) [[cite:PUB00049291]].</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3a5f", "name" "High-resolution structure of DHDPS from Clostridium botulinum in complex with pyruvate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001365" "Dihydrodipicolinate synthase"}, "smart" {"SM01130" "Dihydrodipicolinate synthetase family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12128" "DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE SYNTHASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00701" "Dihydrodipicolinate synthetase family"}, "prints" {"PR00146" "DHPICSNTHASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DapA-like", "short" "DapA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 265, "domain_architectures" 261, "proteomes" 11438, "taxa" 43576, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 121974, "sets" 0, "proteins" 121947, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 91602}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00569", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00569"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0717", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0717"} {"accession" "GenProp0715", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0715"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
