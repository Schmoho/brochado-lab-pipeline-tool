{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Yeast Nsa1 is a ribosomal assembly factor that is functionally linked to type II AAA-ATPase Rix7. Rix7 associates with Nsa1-containing nucleolar pre-60S particles and is required for the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit. The mammalian homologue of Nsa1 is the nucleolar protein WDR74 (WD-repeat containing 74), which has been shown to associate with NVL2 (Rix7 homologue) in the presence of the nuclear Mtr4 exosome complex [[cite:PUB00086831]].</p>\n\n<p>WDR74/Nsa1 is composed of an N-terminal seven-bladed WD40 domain followed by a lysine-rich C terminus that is required for nucleolar localization. The WD40 domain of WDR74 serves as a platform for recruitment of NVL2 to pre-60S particles [[cite:PUB00086832]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5sui", "name" "Ribosome assembly factor NSA1: C-terminal truncation"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16038" "NOP SEVEN ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WDR74/Nsa1", "short" "WDR74/Nsa1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1541, "taxa" 6050, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2999, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2999, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1919}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037379", :literature {"PUB00086831" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hiraishi N" "Ishida Y" "Nagahama M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
