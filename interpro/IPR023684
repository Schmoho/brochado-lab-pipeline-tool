TyrRS is a homodimer which attaches Tyr to the appropriate tRNA. TyrRS is a class I tRNA synthetases, so it aminoacylates the 2'-OH of the nucleotide at the 3' end of the tRNA. The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the class I characteristic 'HIGH' and 'KMSKS' motifs, which are involved in ATP binding.  Studies have shown that the 'KMSKS' motif plays a role in the initial binding of tRNA(Tyr) to tyrosine-tRNA ligase [[cite:PUB00006465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (also known as aminoacyl-tRNA ligases) catalyse the attachment of an amino acid to its cognate transfer RNA molecule in a highly specific two-step reaction [[cite:PUB00079872], [cite:PUB00079873]]. These proteins differ widely in size and oligomeric state, and have limited sequence homology [[cite:PUB00007191]]. The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II. Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contain a characteristic Rossman fold catalytic domain and are mostly monomeric [[cite:PUB00006477]]. Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases share an anti-parallel β-sheet fold flanked by α-helices [[cite:PUB00000386]], and are mostly dimeric or multimeric, containing at least three conserved regions [[cite:PUB00000723], [cite:PUB00005365], [cite:PUB00004391]]. However, tRNA binding involves an α-helical structure that is conserved between class I and class II synthetases. In reactions catalysed by the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the aminoacyl group is coupled to the 2'-hydroxyl of the tRNA, while, in class II reactions, the 3'-hydroxyl site is preferred. The synthetases specific for arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, and some lysine synthetases (non-eukaryotic group) belong to class I synthetases. The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, and some lysine synthetases (non-archaeal group), belong to class-II synthetases. Based on their mode of binding to the tRNA acceptor stem, both classes of tRNA synthetases have been subdivided into three subclasses, designated 1a, 1b, 1c and 2a, 2b, 2c [[cite:PUB00007363]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The class Ia aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases consist of the isoleucyl, methionyl, valyl, leucyl, cysteinyl, and arginyl-tRNA synthetases; the class Ib include the glutamyl and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases, and the class Ic are the tyrosyl and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases [[cite:PUB00055442]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1j1u", "name" "Crystal structure of archaeal tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase complexed with tRNA(Tyr) and L-tyrosine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02008" "Tyrosine--tRNA ligase [tyrS]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine-tRNA ligase, type 3", "short" "Tyr-tRNA-ligase_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 173, "taxa" 1004, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 841, "sets" 0, "proteins" 841, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 728}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
