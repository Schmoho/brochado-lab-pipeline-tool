{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter family is a family of secondary transporters found exclusively in the bacterial kingdom. They function in the metabolism of the di- and tricarboxylates malate and citrate, mostly in fermentative pathways involving decarboxylation of malate or oxaloacetate [[cite:PUB00044708]].</p>\n\n<p>The majority of proteins in this family are known or predicted members of the citrate:cation symporter (CCS) family. They contain the predicted twelve-transmembrane helix motif common to many secondary transporters [[cite:PUB00034458]]. Most of the characterised proteins in this entry are specific for citrate, with either Na+ of H+ as the contransported cation. However, one member is capable of cotransporting either citrate or malate with H+ [[cite:PUB00034459]], while another has been shown to be an Na+-dependent malate cotransporter [[cite:PUB00034460]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40033" "NA(+)-MALATE SYMPORTER"}, "pfam" {"PF03390" "2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005348" "Malate transporter, YxkH type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter", "short" "2-OHcarboxylate_transport"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 540, "taxa" 3397, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3891, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3884, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3022}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004679", :literature {"PUB00044708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sobczak I" "Lolkema JS."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
