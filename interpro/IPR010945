{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Malate dehydrogenases catalyse the interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate using dinucleotide cofactors [[cite:PUB00027655]]. The enzymes in this entry are found in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and fall into two distinct groups. The first group are cytoplasmic, NAD-dependent enzymes which participate in the citric acid cycle ([ec:1.1.1.37]). The second group are found in plant chloroplasts, use NADP as cofactor, and participate in the C4 cycle ([ec:1.1.1.82]).</p>\n\n<p>Structural studies indicate that these enzymes are homodimers with very similar overall topology, though the chloroplast enzymes also have N- and C-terminal extensions, and all contain the classical Rossman fold for NAD(P)H binding [[cite:PUB00021232], [cite:PUB00023558], [cite:PUB00013757], [cite:PUB00023967]]. Substrate specificity is determined by a mobile loop at the active site which uses charge balancing to discriminate between the correct substrates (malate and oxaloacetate) and other potential oxo/hydroxyacid substrates the enzyme may encounter within the cell [[cite:PUB00019781]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1b8p", "name" "MALATE DEHYDROGENASE FROM AQUASPIRILLUM ARCTICUM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015955", "name" "Lactate dehydrogenase/glycoside hydrolase, family 4, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01517" "Malate dehydrogenase [mdh]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01759" "malate dehydrogenase"}, "panther" {"PTHR23382" "MALATE DEHYDROGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Malate dehydrogenase, type 2", "short" "Malate_DH_type2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4316, "taxa" 25305, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24212, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24189, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16768}, "pathways" 166}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1584", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1584"} {"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp1612", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1612"} {"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
