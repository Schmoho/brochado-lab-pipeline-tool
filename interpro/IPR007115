{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>6-Pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase (PTPS) catalyses the conversion of dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin, the second of three enzymatic steps in the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin from GTP [[cite:PUB00001245]]. The functional enzyme is a hexamer of identical subunits. A transition metal binding site formed by the three histidine residues 23, 48 and 50 is present in each subunit, and bound Zn(II) is responsible for the enzymatic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of each of these three histidine residues results in a complete loss of metal binding and enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00015311], [cite:PUB00015312]].</p>\n\n<p>Member this entry is also 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin synthase (QueD) that catalyses the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP) to 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (CPH4) and acetaldehyde [[cite:PUB00106884]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ntk", "name" "QueD from E. coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038418", "name" "6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase/QueD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006113" "6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase"}, "pfam" {"PF01242" "6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00039" "6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase/6-carboxytetrahydropterin synthase family protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR12589" "PYRUVOYL TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN SYNTHASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase/QueD family", "short" "6-PTP_synth/QueD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 102, "proteomes" 7252, "taxa" 31227, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42770, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40422, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30784}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1632", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1632"} {"accession" "GenProp1602", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1602"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
