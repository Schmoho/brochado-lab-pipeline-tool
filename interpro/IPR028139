{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Humanin (HN) and humanin-like proteins are found exclusively in humans. Humanin is a short anti-apoptotic peptide that inhibits the activation of Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), which is involved in apoptosis [[cite:PUB00067562]]. Humanin suppresses neuronal cell death caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific insults [[cite:PUB00067563]]. Humanin also interacts with the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), which is essential in the regulation of cell survival [[cite:PUB00067895]]. This entry represents the humanin family, and also matches some uncharacterised non-human proteins, mainly from chimpanzee.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15040" "Humanin family"}, "panther" {"PTHR33895" "HUMANIN-LIKE 4"}, "cdd" {"cd20245" "humanin and similar peptides"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Humanin family", "short" "Humanin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 47, "taxa" 244, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 127, "sets" 0, "proteins" 127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028139", :literature {"PUB00067895" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Ikonen M" "Liu B" "Hashimoto Y" "Ma L" "Lee KW" "Niikura T" "Nishimoto I" "Cohen P."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
