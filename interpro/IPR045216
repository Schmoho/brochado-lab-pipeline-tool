{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ser/Thr protein kinase CK2 is a tetrameric protein with two catalytic (alpha) and two regulatory (beta) subunits [[cite:PUB00026559], [cite:PUB00021429]]. It is constitutively active and ubiquitously expressed, and is found in the cytoplasm, nucleus, as well as in the plasma membrane. It phosphorylates a wide variety of substrates including gylcogen synthase, cell cycle proteins, nuclear proteins (e.g. DNA topoisomerase II), and ion channels (e.g. ENaC), among others. It may be considered a master kinase controlling the activity or lifespan of many other kinases and exerting its effect over cell fate, gene expression, protein synthesis and degradation, and viral infection [[cite:PUB00098284], [cite:PUB00098285]]. CK2 is implicated in every stage of the cell cycle and is required for cell cycle progression. It plays crucial roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and is thus implicated in cancer. CK2 is not an oncogene by itself but elevated CK2 levels create an environment that enhances the survival of tumour cells [[cite:PUB00098283]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1m2r", "name" "Crystal structure of 5,8-di-amino-1,4-di-hydroxy-anthraquinone/CK2 kinase complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24054" "CASEIN KINASE II SUBUNIT ALPHA"}, "cdd" {"cd14132" "Catalytic subunit (alpha) of the Serine/Threonine Kinase, Casein Kinase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Casein Kinase 2, subunit alpha", "short" "CK2_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 341, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2705, "taxa" 9533, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10930, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10919, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6829}, "pathways" 66}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
