{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The cryptochrome and photolyase families consist of structurally related flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) proteins that use the absorption of blue light to accomplish different tasks. The photolyasess use the blue light for light-driven electron transfer to repair UV-damaged DNA, while the cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors involved in the circadian clock for plants and animals [[cite:PUB00076729], [cite:PUB00076730]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents a branch of the photolyase/cryptochrome family that is known as the cryptochrome-DASH family (Cry-DASH).
