{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of ZPR1-like proteins predominantly found in archaea, including the poorly characterised ZPR1-like proteins PH1223 and MJ0530. ZPR1 was shown experimentally to bind zinc. ZPR1 binds the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor [[cite:PUB00017397]] but is displaced by receptor activation and autophosphorylation after which it redistributes in part to the nucleus. The function of ZPR1 from archaea and eukaryotes is not yet clear. However, Zpr1 from yeast acts as a protein folding chaperone for elongation factor 1-alpha [[cite:PUB00103908]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042451", "name" "ZPR1, A/B domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00340" "zinc finger protein ZPR1 homolog"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ZPR1-like, archaea", "short" "ZPR1-like_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 1094, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1443, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1443, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1130}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004470", :literature {"PUB00103908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sabbarini IM" "Reif D" "McQuown AJ" "Nelliat AR" "Prince J" "Membreno BS" "Wu CC" "Murray AW" "Denic V."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Zinc-finger protein Zpr1 is a bespoke chaperone essential for eEF1A biogenesis.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "252-265.e13", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36630955}, "PUB00017397" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5269", "authors" ["Galcheva-Gargova Z" "Konstantinov KN" "Wu IH" "Klier FG" "Barrett T" "Davis RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/272/5269/1797", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Binding of zinc finger protein ZPR1 to the epidermal growth factor receptor.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "1797-802", "volume" "272", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8650580}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040141", "name" "ZPR1", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004470", "name" "ZPR1-like, archaea", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
