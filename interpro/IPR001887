{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Barnase is the extracellular ribonuclease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and barstar its specific intracellular inhibitor [[cite:PUB00005346], [cite:PUB00003231]]. Expression of barstar is necessary to counter the lethal effect of expressed active barnase. Barnase hydrolyses phosphodiester bonds in RNA, poly- and oligo-ribonucleotides, resulting in 3'-nucleoside monophosphates via 2',3'-cyclo-phospate intermediates. It is a small single-chain protein that has neither disulphide bonds nor non-peptide components. The NMR structure [[cite:PUB00000354]] contains 2 α-helices and a 5-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The protein core is formed by the packing of the first α-helix onto the β-sheet.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1a2p", "name" "BARNASE WILDTYPE STRUCTURE AT 1.5 ANGSTROMS RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016191", "name" "Ribonuclease/ribotoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00933" "barnase"}, "prints" {"PR00117" "BARNASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001013" "Predicted ribonuclease, barnase type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Barnase", "short" "Barnase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 59, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 305, "taxa" 1843, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4248, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1636, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1211}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
