{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The SLAM/CD2 family of receptors plays important roles in regulating multiple cellular interactions in the adaptive and innate immune systems [[cite:PUB00090162]].</p>\n\n<p>Signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) receptors are expressed in multiple cells of the immune system, including natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells [[cite:PUB00034934], [cite:PUB00155120], [cite:PUB00155121], [cite:PUB00155119]]. SLAM receptors interact with SH2 domain-containing, cytosolic adaptor proteins such as SAP, EAT-2, and SH2D1A, and mediate tyrosine phosphorylation events that contribute to immune cell activation. The finding that mutations in SAP are associated with an X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder [[cite:PUB00034935]] suggests that signalling through SLAM receptors can influence the development and effector functions of immune cells.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes V-set and transmembrane domain-containing protein 5, a cell adhesion-like membrane protein of the central nervous system (CNS) which modulates both the position and complexity of central neurons by altering their membrane morphology and dynamics. It ia involved in the formation of neuronal dendrites and protrusions including dendritic filopodia. In synaptogenesis, regulates synapse formation by altering dendritic spine morphology and actin distribution [[cite:PUB00155122]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ccz", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE CD2-BINDING DOMAIN OF CD58 (LYMPHOCYTE FUNCTION-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN 3) AT 1.8-A RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12080" "SIGNALING LYMPHOCYTIC ACTIVATION MOLECULE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CD2/SLAM family receptor", "short" "CD2/SLAM_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 666, "taxa" 2422, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6879}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015631", :literature {"PUB00034934" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Veillette A" "Latour S."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
