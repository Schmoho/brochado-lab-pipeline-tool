{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes archaeal exosome complex component Csl4 and its homologues from eukaryotes (also known as exosome component 1 EXOSC1 in mammals). In budding yeast, Csl4 is also known as Ski4 due to its superkiller (SKI) phenotype first described as a more efficient ability to kill sensitive non-killer yeast strains [[cite:PUB00090086], [cite:PUB00090084]]. Later, it was found to be part of the yeast exosome complex involved in 3'-5' RNA processing and degradation in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00090085]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Csl4 is a non-catalytic component of the exosome, a complex involved in RNA processing and degradation [[cite:PUB00035570], [cite:PUB00074124]]. The exact composition of the exosome varies, depending on the organism or the subcellular localization, but in all cases it is composed of a ring-shaped core made of three heterodimers (Rrp41p/Rrp45p, Rrp43p /Rrp46p, Rrp42p/Mtr3p) stabilized by the presence of three other proteins (Csl4/Ski4, Rrp4p, Rrp40p) [[cite:PUB00090084]].  The presence of different proteins in the cap may enable interactions with different substrates. It has been shown that the archaeal DnaG protein needs Csl4 for binding to the exosome. DnaG is a poly(A)-binding protein and enhances the degradation of adenine-rich transcripts by the Csl4-exosome [[cite:PUB00074085]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12686" "3'-5' EXORIBONUCLEASE CSL4-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosome complex component Csl4", "short" "Csl4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2628, "taxa" 9782, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5918, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5918, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4266}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039771", :literature {"PUB00074124" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Hartung S" "Niederberger T" "Hartung M" "Tresch A" "Hopfner KP."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq238", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Quantitative analysis of processive RNA degradation by the archaeal RNA exosome.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "5166-76", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20392821}, "PUB00090085" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["van Hoof A" "Staples RR" "Baker RE" "Parker R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
