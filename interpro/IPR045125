{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivators, including Sub1 from budding yeasts, Tcp4 from animals and KIWI/KELP from plants.</p>\n\n<p>Tcp4, also known as p15, is a coactivator that functions cooperatively with TAFs and mediates functional interactions between upstream activators and the general transcriptional machinery. It has a bipartite structure composed of an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxy-terminal cryptic DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00006308]]. The DNA-binding activity of the carboxy-terminal is disguised by the amino-terminal p15 domain. Activity is controlled by protein kinases that target the regulatory domain.</p>\n\n<p>Sub1 facilitates elongation by influencing enzymes that modify RNAP II (RNA polymerase II) [[cite:PUB00098093]]. It is required for NHEJ repair of DSBs in plasmid DNA, but not in chromosomal DNA [[cite:PUB00098092]].</p>\n\n<p>KELP has been shown to bind to movement protein (MP) of tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and interferes with virus cell-to-cell movement [[cite:PUB00085127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pcf", "name" "HUMAN TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR PC4 C-TERMINAL DOMAIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009044", "name" "ssDNA-binding transcriptional regulator", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13215" "RNA POLYMERASE II TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator Sub1/Tcp4-like", "short" "Sub1/Tcp4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2349, "taxa" 9885, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5516, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5516, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3143}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045125", :literature {"PUB00006308" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kretzschmar M" "Kaiser K" "Lottspeich F" "Meisterernst M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(94)90429-4", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A novel mediator of class II gene transcription with homology to viral immediate-early transcriptional regulators.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "525-34", "volume" "78", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8062392}, "PUB00098092" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yu L" "Volkert MR."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Differential requirement for SUB1 in chromosomal and plasmid double-strand DNA break repair.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e58015", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23554872}, "PUB00098093" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Calvo O" "Manley JL."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The transcriptional coactivator PC4/Sub1 has multiple functions in RNA polymerase II transcription.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1009-20", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15692559}, "PUB00085127" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sasaki N" "Ogata T" "Deguchi M" "Nagai S" "Tamai A" "Meshi T" "Kawakami S" "Watanabe Y" "Matsushita Y" "Nyunoya H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
