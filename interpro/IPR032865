{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the member A of the E2/UBC superfamily of proteins found in several bacteria. The active site residues are very similar to the eukaryotic E2 proteins [[cite:PUB00034476], [cite:PUB00057888]]. Members of this family are usually fused to E1 and JAB domains C-terminal to the E2 domain. The protein is usually in the gene neighbourhood of a gene encoding a distinct metallobetalactamase family protein [[cite:PUB00034476]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14457" "Prokaryotic E2 family A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prokaryotic E2 family A", "short" "Prok-E2_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 188, "taxa" 1607, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 778, "sets" 0, "proteins" 778, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 599}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032865", :literature {"PUB00034476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-7-r60", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The prokaryotic antecedents of the ubiquitin-signaling system and the early evolution of ubiquitin-like beta-grasp domains.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "R60", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16859499}, "PUB00057888" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Burroughs AM" "Jaffee M" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
