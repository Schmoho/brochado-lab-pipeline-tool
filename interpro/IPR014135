{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti-plasmid TraG, it is responsible for conjugative transfer of the entire plasmid among Agrobacterium strains [[cite:PUB00012375]]. The protein is distantly related to the F-type conjugation system TraG protein. Both of these systems are examples of type IV secretion systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in this entry is the type IV secretion system-coupling protein VirD4 from Bartonella henselae.  Substrates for VirD4 include the effector proteins BepA-G, which when injected into the human host epithelial cells (HEC) brings about rearrangement of the HEC cytoskeleton, inhibition of apoptosis, and proinflammatory activation by nuclear factor NF-kappa-B [[cite:PUB00060321]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02767" "Ti-type conjugative transfer system protein TraG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conjugal transfer protein TraG-like", "short" "Ti-typ_conjug_TS_TraG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 526, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 758, "sets" 0, "proteins" 758, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 617}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0490", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0490"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014135", :literature {"PUB00012375" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Farrand SK" "Hwang I" "Cook DM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
