{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductases (pDCR) from eukaryotes and its homologues from bacteria and archaea. DCR is an auxiliary enzyme of fatty acid beta-oxidation. Proteins in this family belong to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. They share a highly conserved Rossmann fold used for binding cofactors like NADH or NADPH. Unlike other members belonging to the SDR family, catalysis by pDCR does not involve a tyrosine-serine pair. Instead, a catalytically critical aspartate, together with an invariant lysine, polarizes a water molecule to donate a proton for the formation of the product [[cite:PUB00061112]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3imf", "name" "1.99 Angstrom resolution crystal structure of a short chain dehydrogenase from Bacillus anthracis str.
