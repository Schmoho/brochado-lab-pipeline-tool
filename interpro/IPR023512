{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes MtaD from Thermotoga maritima and a 5'-deoxyadenosine deaminase DadD from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. MtaD protein has been shown to catalyse the deamination of 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA), S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and adenosine in vitro [[cite:PUB00043239]]. DadD protein catalyses the deamination of 5'-deoxyadenosine into 5'-deoxyinosine and may play a role in recycling the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme reaction product 5'-deoxyadenosine [[cite:PUB00074086]]. Conserved residues present in other members of this family strongly suggest that they have a similar function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1p1m", "name" "Structure of Thermotoga maritima amidohydrolase TM0936 bound to Ni and methionine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011059", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase, composite domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01281" "5'-deoxyadenosine deaminase [dadD]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deaminase MtaD/DadD", "short" "Deaminase_MtaD/DadD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1397, "taxa" 6471, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7391, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7391, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5740}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
