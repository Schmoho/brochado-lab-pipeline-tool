{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Satellite RNAs (satRNAs) are short RNA molecules, usually larger than 1,500 nt, that depend on cognate helper viruses for replication, encapsidation, movement, and transmission, but most share little or no sequence homology to the helper viruses. In contrast, satellite viruses are satRNAs that encode and are encapsidated in their own capsid proteins (CPs) [[cite:PUB00085321]]. Members of this family are nonstructural proteins of 48kDa in size which have been shown to be involved in the replication of the sat-RNA. They are found in tomato black ring virus (TBRV) [[cite:PUB00085322]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17485" "Satellite RNA 48 kDa protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Satellite RNA 48kDa protein", "short" "SatRNA_48"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 20, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035312", :literature {"PUB00085321" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hu CC" "Hsu YH" "Lin NS."], "ISO_journal" "Viruses", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/v1031325", "medline_journal" "Viruses", "title" "Satellite RNAs and Satellite Viruses of Plants.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1325-50", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21994595}, "PUB00085322" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Oncino C" "Hemmer O" "Fritsch C."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1006/viro.1995.1549", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Specificity in the association of tomato black ring virus satellite RNA with helper virus.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "87-96", "volume" "213", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7483283}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035312", "name" "Satellite RNA 48kDa protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
