{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ESX-1 to ESX-5 gene clusters encode proteins that are either secreted or building blocks of the actinobacterial Type 7 secretion system (T7SS) [[cite:PUB00053896]]. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESX-1 is responsible for secretion of important virulence factors such as EsxA and EsxB as well as other virulence-associated proteins, ESX-3 is involved in metal acquisition being critical for mycobacterial survival. ESX-5 is also important for the secretion of members of the PE/PPE family of proteins that play a role in virulence and cell wall integrity. The function of ESX-2 and ESX-4 is still unknown although ESX-4 seems to be the ancestral system from which ESX systems have evolved. All ESX gene clusters contain three or four ESX conserved components (Ecc), named EccB, EccC, and EccD, with EccE being present in all ESX systems, except of ESX-4. EccC is a member of the FtsK/SpoIIIE-like ATPase family and provides the energy to transport proteins across the mycobacterial membrane; EccB and EccE have N-terminal transmembrane elements and large C-terminal regions predicted to be localised in the periplasm, but their function, molecular function or interacting partners remain unknown. EccD contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by 11 predicted transmembrane helices, which is thought to form a cytoplasmic membrane channel through which the proteins are secreted [[cite:PUB00093032]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the EccD family of proteins, which includes EccD1-5. EccD1, also known as Snm4, has a ubiquitin-like fold and forms a dimer, with a negatively charged groove which indicates that it likely interacts with positive charged partners and may recruit other T7SS components or secretion substrates or it may form a gating element to close the channel during inactive periods. The residues forming the negatively charged groove are not conserved in EccD1 homologs from other ESX systems, suggesting that they have a system-specific role. It is responsible for multiple suppressive effects on macrophages and required for bacterial replication after phagocytosis [[cite:PUB00053901], [cite:PUB00053902]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03920" "type VII secretion integral membrane protein EccD"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017804" "Secretion system protein, EccD1 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type VII secretion system membrane protein EccD", "short" "T7SS_EccD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1130, "taxa" 3223, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5881, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5877, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4574}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0904", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0904"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006707", :literature {"PUB00053901" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Stanley SA" "Raghavan S" "Hwang WW" "Cox JS."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
