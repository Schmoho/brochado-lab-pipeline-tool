It suppresses both G-quadruplex-associated DNA damage and telomere lengthening. In budding yeast, it exists in two forms, nuclear form and mitochondrial form. Its nuclear form inhibits telomerase, while its mitochondrial form is involved in repair and recombination of mitochondrial DNA [[cite:PUB00066823], [cite:PUB00066824]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hph", "name" "Crystal structure of human Pif1 helicase in complex with AMP-PNP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03176" "ATP-dependent DNA helicase PIF1 [PIF1]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA helicase PIF1/RRM3/pfh1", "short" "PIF1_RRM3_pfh1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1182, "taxa" 4318, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2169, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2168, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1340}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
