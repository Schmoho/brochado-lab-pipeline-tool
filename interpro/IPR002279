{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Melatonin is a naturally occurring compound found in animals, plants, and microbes [[cite:PUB00066873], [cite:PUB00066874]].   In animals melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland during darkness [[cite:PUB00066875], [cite:PUB00066876]].  It regulates a variety of neuroendocrine functions and is thought to play an essential role in circadian rhythms [[cite:PUB00066877]].   Drugs that modify the action of melatonin, and hence influence circadian cycles, are of clinical interest for example, in the treatment of jet-lag [[cite:PUB00066878]].</p>\r\n<p>Many of the biological effects of melatonin are produced through the activation of melatonin receptors [[cite:PUB00066879]], which are members of rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor family.   There are three melatonin receptor subtypes. Melatonin receptor type 1A and melatonin receptor type 1B are present in humans and other mammals [[cite:PUB00066880]] while melatonin receptor type 1C has been identified in amphibia and birds [[cite:PUB00066881]].  There is also a closely-related orphan receptor, termed melatonin-related receptor type 1X (also known as GPR50) [[cite:PUB00066882]], is yet to achieve receptor status from the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR), since a robust response mediated via the protein has not been reported in the literature.  Melatonin receptor type 1C receptors are 80% identical and are distinct from 1A and 1B subtypes. Similar ligand binding and functional characteristics are observed in expressed 1A and 1C receptors.  The melatonin receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase via a pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-protein, probably of the Gi/Go class.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents melatonin receptor 1C, which is found in birds, fish and amphibians, but not in humans [[cite:PUB00004315]]. It has been shown that the widespread distribution of 1C in brain provides a molecular substrate for the profound actions of melatonin in birds [[cite:PUB00004315]]. Also, in amphibians, very low concentrations of melatonin activate the 1C receptor subtype, triggering movement of granules toward the cell centre, thus lightening skin colour. 1C receptor activation reduces intracellular cAMP via a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G-protein (Gi) [[cite:PUB00066881]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01150" "MELATONIN1CR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Melatonin receptor type 1C", "short" "Mel_rcpt_1C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 455, "taxa" 1581, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2220, "sets" 0, "proteins" 648, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 474}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002279", :literature {"PUB00066873" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Caniato R" "Filippini R" "Piovan A" "Puricelli L" "Borsarini A" "Cappelletti EM."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
