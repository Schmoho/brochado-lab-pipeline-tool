{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>4-hydroxy 2-ketovalerate aldolase (also known as 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate aldolase (HOA)) converts 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate to acetaldehyde and pyruvate, the penultimate step in the meta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of phenols, cresols and catechol.  Acetaldehyde is then converted by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) (DmpF; [ec:1.2.1.10]) to acetyl-CoA. The two enzymes are tightly associated.  This family includes the Escherichia coli MhpE aldolase [[cite:PUB00085887]], the Pseudomonas DmpG aldolase, and the Burkholderia xenovorans BphI pyruvate aldolase [[cite:PUB00085888]].  In Pseudomonas, the DmpG aldolase tightly associates with a dehydrogenase (DmpF) and is inactive without it [[cite:PUB00085889]].  HOA has a canonical TIM-barrel fold with a C-terminal extension that forms a funnel leading to the active site [[cite:PUB00016385]].  This family belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DRE-TIM metallolyases include 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, homocitrate synthase, citramalate synthase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, re-citrate synthase, transcarboxylase 5S, pyruvate carboxylase, AksA, and FrbC.  These members all share a conserved triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain consisting of a core β(8)-α(8) motif with the eight parallel β strands forming an enclosed barrel surrounded by eight α helices.  The domain has a catalytic centre containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.  In addition, the catalytic site includes three invariant residues - an aspartate (D), an arginine (R), and a glutamate (E) - which is the basis for the domain name 'DRE-TIM' [[cite:PUB00038481]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1nvm", "name" "Crystal structure of a bifunctional aldolase-dehydrogenase : sequestering a reactive and volatile intermediate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03217" "4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01656" "4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase [mhpE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase", "short" "4OH_2_O-val_aldolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1482, "taxa" 6195, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7058, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7058, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5679}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1231", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1231"} {"accession" "GenProp0708", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0708"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
