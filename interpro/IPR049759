{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Immunity protein CdiI ([swissprot:P0DSM8])from Escherichia coli and similar sequences from proteobacteria. Together with the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), CdiI exerts a unique ribonuclease activity that cleaves the single-stranded 3'-end from tRNAs that contain guanine discriminator nucleotides. EF-Tu is an essential and highly conserved translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNA) to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Structure studies suggest the toxin remodels the GTP:EF-Tu:aa-tRNA complexes to free the 3'-end of aa-tRNA for entry into the nuclease active site [[cite:PUB00145391], [cite:PUB00145392], [cite:PUB00100045]].</p>\n\n<p>CDI toxins, part of a a cellular contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system, are expressed by gram-negative bacteria as part of a mechanism to inhibit the growth of neighbouring cells. CdiI immunity proteins are intracellular proteins that inactivate the toxin/effector protein. They are specific for their cognate CdiA-CT and do not protect cells from the toxins of other CDI  bacteria. The CdiI immunity protein binds the CdiA toxin via its C-terminal domain to prevent auto-inhibition. Thus, CDI systems encode a complex network of toxin-immunity protein pairs that are deployed for intercellular competition [[cite:PUB00145391], [cite:PUB00145392], [cite:PUB00100045], [cite:PUB00094027]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21060" "immunity protein of the contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system of Escherichia coli NC101, and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunity protein CdiI-like", "short" "CdiI-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 43}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049759", :literature {"PUB00100045" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Jones AM" "Garza-Sanchez F" "So J" "Hayes CS" "Low DA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Activation of contact-dependent antibacterial tRNase toxins by translation elongation factors.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "E1951-E1957", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28223500}, "PUB00145391" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Michalska K" "Gucinski GC" "Garza-Sanchez F" "Johnson PM" "Stols LM" "Eschenfeldt WH" "Babnigg G" "Low DA" "Goulding CW" "Joachimiak A" "Hayes CS."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Structure of a novel antibacterial toxin that exploits elongation factor Tu to cleave specific transfer RNAs.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "10306-10320", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28973472}, "PUB00145392" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Souza DP" "Oka GU" "Alvarez-Martinez CE" "Bisson-Filho AW" "Dunger G" "Hobeika L" "Cavalcante NS" "Alegria MC" "Barbosa LR" "Salinas RK" "Guzzo CR" "Farah CS."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Bacterial killing via a type IV secretion system.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "6453", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25743609}, "PUB00094027" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Willett JL" "Gucinski GC" "Fatherree JP" "Low DA" "Hayes CS."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
