{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) [[cite:PUB00004691], [cite:PUB00002669]] is an important enzyme of carbohydrate metabolism which catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. IDH is either dependent on NAD<sup>+</sup> ([ec:1.1.1.41]) or on NADP<sup>+</sup> ([ec:1.1.1.42]). In eukaryotes there are at least three isozymes of IDH: two are located in the mitochondrial matrix (one NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent, the other NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent), while the third one (also NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent) is cytoplasmic. In Escherichia coli the activity of a NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent form of the enzyme is controlled by the phosphorylation of a serine residue; the phosphorylated form of IDH is completely inactivated.</p>\n\n<p>The eukaryotic, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, are defined by this family that includes cytosolic, mitochondrial, and chloroplast enzymes, as well as bacterial proteins. This family differs considerably from other isocitrate dehydrogenases that are included in a different group together with 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenases and tartrate dehydrogenases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2uxq", "name" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase from the psychrophilic bacterium Desulfotalea psychrophila: biochemical properties and crystal structure analysis"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00127" "isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+))"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000108" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP)"}, "panther" {"PTHR11822" "NADP-SPECIFIC ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase NADP-dependent", "short" "Isocitrate_DH_NADP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 93, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5633, "taxa" 28882, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25932, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25682, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17820}, "pathways" 44}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1502", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1502"} {"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
