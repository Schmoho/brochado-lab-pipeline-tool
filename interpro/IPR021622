{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is found in mammals where it is localised at cell-cell adherens junctions [[cite:PUB00053518]], and in Sch. pombe and other fungi where it anchors spindle-pole bodies to spindle microtubules [[cite:PUB00053519]]. It is a coiled-coil structure, and in pombe, it is required for anchoring the minus end of spindle microtubules to the centrosome equivalent, the spindle-pole body. The name ADIP derives from the family being composed of Afadin- and alpha Actinin-Binding Proteins Localised at Cell-Cell Adherens Junctions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11559" "Afadin- and alpha -actinin-Binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Afadin/alpha-actinin-binding", "short" "Afadin/alpha-actinin-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 56, "proteomes" 1944, "taxa" 6354, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3922, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2410}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021622", :literature {"PUB00053519" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Toya M" "Sato M" "Haselmann U" "Asakawa K" "Brunner D" "Antony C" "Toda T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
