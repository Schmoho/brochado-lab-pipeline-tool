{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Influenza A virus belongs to the class of ssRNA negative-strand viruses. Influenza virus NS2 protein (also known as NEP) has an important role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of the viral ribonucleoprotein. The NS2 proteins perform this function in virus-infected cells by interacting with nuclear pore complex components of the host cell [[cite:PUB00094709]]. It is also involved in important functions during influenza virus replication. Regulation of viral RNA transcription and replication by NS2 was shown to be an important factor in the adaptation of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses to the mammalian host [[cite:PUB00094710]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00601" "Influenza non-structural protein (NS2)"}, "hamap" {"MF_04067" "Nuclear export protein [NS]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Influenza nuclear export protein NS2", "short" "Flu_NS2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 57866, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 61531, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61531, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1012", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1012"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000968", :literature {"PUB00094709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Senbas Akyazi B" "Pirincal A" "Kawaguchi A" "Nagata K" "Turan K."], "ISO_journal" "Turk.
