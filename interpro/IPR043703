{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amidated peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria is essential for peptidoglycan (PG) cross-linking, playing an important role in homeostasis, antibiotic resistance and cell survival. The bi-enzymatic complex MurT-GatD catalyses the amidation process in PG stem peptides, in which MurT is the ligase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of D-glutamate to D-isoglutamine using the ammonia provided by GatD, resulting in the amidation of the Î±-carboxyl group of the D-isoglutamate residue in Lipid II. MurT has sequence similarity to substrate-binding domains in Mur ligases [[cite:PUB00094480], [cite:PUB00094478]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036565", "name" "Mur-like, catalytic domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02214" "Lipid II isoglutaminyl synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) subunit MurT [murT]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid II isoglutaminyl synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) subunit MurT", "short" "Lipid_II_synth_MurT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2179, "taxa" 8195, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8357, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8357, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6399}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
