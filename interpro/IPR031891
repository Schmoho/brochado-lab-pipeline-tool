{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DMP12 is a DNA-mimic protein from Neisseria species. In its monomeric form DMP12 interacts with the Neisseria dimeric form of the bacterial histone-like protein HU. HU proteins promote the assembly of higher-order DNA-protein structures. The interaction between DMP12 and HU may be instrumental in controlling the stability of the nucleoid in Neisseria, as DMP12 prevents Neisseria HU protein from being digested by trypsin [[cite:PUB00067123]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3w1o", "name" "Neisseria DNA mimic protein DMP12"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038223", "name" "DNA-mimic protein DMP12 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14245" "Putative DNA mimic protein DMP12"}, "pfam" {"PF16779" "DNA-mimic protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-mimic protein DMP12", "short" "DMP12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 53, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031891", :literature {"PUB00067123" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Wang HC" "Wu ML" "Ko TP" "Wang AH."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt201", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Neisseria conserved hypothetical protein DMP12 is a DNA mimic that binds to histone-like HU protein.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "5127-38", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23531546}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031891", "name" "DNA-mimic protein DMP12", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 6}}}
