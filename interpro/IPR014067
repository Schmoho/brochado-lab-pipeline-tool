{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing oxidoreductases, including Arsenite oxidase subunit AioB from Alcaligenes faecalis and Iodate reductase subunit IdrB from Pseudomonas sp. AioB is the small subunit of an arsenite oxidase complex. It is a Rieske protein and appears to rely on the Tat (twin-arginine translocation) system to cross the membrane. Although this enzyme could run in the direction of arsenate reduction to arsenite in principle, the relevant biological function is arsenite oxidation for energy metabolism, not arsenic resistance [[cite:PUB00100806], [cite:PUB00034441]]. IdrB, a Rieske-type protein with a [2Fe-2S]-binding motif, is involved in iodate respiration [[cite:PUB00100773], [cite:PUB00100802]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1g8k", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF ARSENITE OXIDASE FROM ALCALIGENES FAECALIS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036922", "name" "Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulphur domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03476" "Rieske_ArOX_small"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02694" "arsenate reductase (azurin) small subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenite oxidase subunit AioB/Iodate reductase subunit IdrB, small subunit", "short" "AioB/IdrB_ssu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 175, "taxa" 1196, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 830, "sets" 0, "proteins" 830, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 652}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0473", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0473"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
