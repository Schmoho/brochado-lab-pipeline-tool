TFIIIC assembles the initiation complex TFIIIB-TFIIIC-tDNA, sufficient for RNA polymerase III recruitment and function. Tfc3 is essential for cell viability as it is required for RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15180" "GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 3C POLYPEPTIDE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor Tfc3-like", "short" "Tfc3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2357, "taxa" 7984, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5428, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5428, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1058}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044210", :literature {"PUB00089469" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Huang Y" "Hamada M" "Maraia RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
