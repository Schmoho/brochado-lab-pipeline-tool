{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) catalyses the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to methylglyoxal and phosphate:</p>\n\n<p>\n<reaction>\nGlycerone phosphate = methylglyoxal + phosphate\n</reaction>\n</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the catalytic mechanism is believed to be similar to TIM (triosephosphate isomerase) in that both enzymes utilise DHAP to form an ene-diolate phosphate intermediate. In MGS, the second catalytic step is characterised by the elimination of phosphate and collapse of the enediolate to form methylglyoxal instead of reprotonation to form the isomer glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, as in TIM. This is the first reaction in the methylglyoxal bypass of the Embden-Myerhoff glycolytic pathway and is believed to provide physiological benefits under non-ideal growth conditions in bacteria [[cite:PUB00006181]]. MGS is a small protein of about 13 to 17kDa. An aspartate residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00028433]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wo8", "name" "Crystal structure of methylglyoxal synthase from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036914", "name" "Methylglyoxal synthase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01422" "MGS"}, "panther" {"PTHR30492" "METHYLGLYOXAL SYNTHASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00549" "Methylglyoxal synthase [mgsA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00160" "methylglyoxal synthase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006614" "Methylglyoxal synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylglyoxal synthase", "short" "Methylgl_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4018, "taxa" 16531, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17096, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17095, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13306}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC01037", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC01037"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
