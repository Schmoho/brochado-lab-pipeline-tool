{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SETD3 is a protein-histidine N-methyltransferase that specifically mediates methylation of actin at 'His-73' [[cite:PUB00092451]]. It was initially reported to have histone methyltransferase activity and methylate 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K4me and H3K36me). However, this conclusion was based on mass spectrometry data wherein mass shifts were inconsistent with a bona fide methylation event.

They transfer a methyl group most frequently from S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as oxygen leading to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and a methylated molecule [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]]. All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]]. The substrates that are methylated by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small molecules, to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00006319]]. Methyltransferase are therefore involved in many essential cellular processes including biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]].
