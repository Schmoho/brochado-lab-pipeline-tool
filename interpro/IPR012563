{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the Gns/GnsA/GnsB proteins. GnsA and GnsB are multicopy suppressors of the cold-sensitive secG null mutation. These proteins participate in the synthesis of phospholipids, suggesting the functional relationship between SecG and membrane phospholipids. Overexpression of gnsA and gnsB causes a remarkable increase in the unsaturated fatty acid content. However, the gnsA-gnsB double null mutant exhibits no effect. Both proteins are predicted to possess a helix-turn-helix structure [[cite:PUB00016518]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xo1", "name" "crystal structure of Se-Met GnsA with double mutations"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08178" "GnsA/GnsB toxin of bacterial toxin-antitoxin system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gns", "short" "Gns"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 492, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 542, "sets" 0, "proteins" 542, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 418}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012563", :literature {"PUB00016518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Sugai R" "Shimizu H" "Nishiyama K" "Tokuda H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
