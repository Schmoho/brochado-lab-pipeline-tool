{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<P>This entry represents coagulation factors V and VIII, as well as other members of the multicopper oxidase family including the functionally similar venom prothrombin activator subunits, and the possible ferroxidase, hephaestin.</P>\r\n<p>Mammalian coagulation factors V and VIII play analogous roles as non-enzymatic cofactors in the activation of prothrombin and factor X, respectively. They are proteolytically activated by thrombin and inactivated by activated protein C (APC).</p>\r\n<p>The structures of factor V and VIII have been determined [[cite:PUB00031000], [cite:PUB00027871]].  The domain architecture of their precursor molecules can be represented as A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. The A domains are diverged versions of the multicopper oxidase domain ([pfam:PF00394]). The B domain is highly variable and is removed during activation to yield non-covalently-associated heavy and light chains; this domain in mammalian factor V contains multiple copies of a 9-residue repeat (see [interpro:IPR009271]). The C domains ([pfam:PF00754]) promote membrane binding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000354" "Coagulation factor V-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coagulation factor 5/8-like", "short" "Factor_5/8-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 607, "taxa" 2113, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2940, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 790}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
