{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>14-3-3 tau/theta (tau in humans, theta in mice) isoform is encoded by the YWHAQ gene in humans and plays an important role in controlling apoptosis through interactions with ASK1, c-jun NH-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Its interaction with CDC25c regulates entry into the cell cycle and subsequent interaction with Bad prevents apoptosis. 14-3-3 theta protein expression is induced in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [[cite:PUB00093105]]. 14-3-3 tau is often overexpressed in breast cancer, which is associated with the downregulation of p21, a p53 target gene, and thus leads to tamoxifen resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cells and shorter patient survival. Therefore, 14-3-3 tau may be a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer [[cite:PUB00093106]]. Additionally, 14-3-3 theta mediates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome [[cite:PUB00093104]]. 14-3-3 domain is an essential part of 14-3-3 proteins, a ubiquitous class of regulatory, phosphoserine/threonine-binding proteins found in all eukaryotic cells, including yeast, protozoa and mammalian cells [[cite:PUB00003441]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6bcr", "name" "Complex of 14-3-3 theta with an IRSp53 peptide phosphorylated at T340"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036815", "name" "14-3-3 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10023" "14-3-3 theta/tau (theta in mice, tau in human), an isoform of 14-3-3 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "14-3-3 theta", "short" "14-3-3_theta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 394, "taxa" 1274, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 453, "sets" 0, "proteins" 453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 362}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042584", :literature {"PUB00093105" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Malaspina A" "Kaushik N" "de Belleroche J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
