{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents endonuclease II from phage T4, encoded by gene danA, which catalyses the initial step in host DNA degradation allowing the scavenging of host-derived nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis. T4 phage DNA is protected from EndoII by hydroxymethylation and glucosylation of cytosine residues [[cite:PUB00096448], [cite:PUB00096446]]. EndoII belongs to the GIY-YIG family of enzymes and is able to cleave the two strands, independently of each other, of a long, asymmetric, and ambiguous DNA sequence. This cleavage is the result of concerted single-strand nicks, but many positions are only nicked, not cleaved. EndoII binds to two DNA substrates as an X-shaped tetrameric structure composed as a dimer of dimers [[cite:PUB00096449]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wsh", "name" "Structure of bacteriophage T4 EndoII E118A mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035901", "name" "GIY-YIG endonuclease superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR053748", "name" "Host DNA Degradation Endonuclease", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004362" "Endonuclease II, phage DenA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage T4, DenA, endonuclease II", "short" "Phage_T4_DenA_endoDNaseII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 36, "taxa" 739, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 521, "sets" 0, "proteins" 521, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
