{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>VirB proteins are suggested to act at the bacterial surface and there play an important role in directing t-DNA transfer to plant cells. VirB6 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens is an essential component of the type IV secretion machinery for T pilus formation and genetic transformation of plants. Absence of VirB6 leads to reduced cellular levels of VirB5 and VirB3, which were proposed to assist T pilus formation as minor component(s) or assembly factor(s), respectively [[cite:PUB00019242], [cite:PUB00020483]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04610" "TrbL/VirB6 plasmid conjugal transfer protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasmid conjugal transfer TrbL/VirB6", "short" "Conjugal_tfr_TrbL/VirB6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 38, "proteomes" 1637, "taxa" 7999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13190, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13170, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10530}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0485", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0485"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007688", :literature {"PUB00019242" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Li PL" "Hwang I" "Miyagi H" "True H" "Farrand SK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
