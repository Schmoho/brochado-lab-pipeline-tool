{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the small ribosomal subunit protein bS1m from yeast and similar fungal sequences. bS1m, previously known as MRP51, is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), a dedicated translation machinery responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitoribosomes are attached to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane. bS1m functionally interacts with the 5'-UTR of mitochondrial mRNAs [[cite:PUB00089004], [cite:PUB00098057]]. This family also includes Meiotically up-regulated gene 178 protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Mug178), which has a role in meiosis [[cite:PUB00044889]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28058" "37S RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN MRP51, MITOCHONDRIAL"}, "pfam" {"PF11709" "Mitochondrial ribosomal protein subunit"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018156" "Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L51, fungal type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein bS1m-like", "short" "Rbsml_bS1m-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 1131, "taxa" 3018, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1684, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1643, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1022}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016712", :literature {"PUB00089004" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Pfeffer S" "Woellhaf MW" "Herrmann JM" "Forster F."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7019", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Organization of the mitochondrial translation machinery studied in situ by cryoelectron tomography.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "6019", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25609543}, "PUB00098057" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6324", "authors" ["Desai N" "Brown A" "Amunts A" "Ramakrishnan V."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The structure of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "528-531", "volume" "355", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28154081}, "PUB00044889" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Martin-Castellanos C" "Blanco M" "Rozalen AE" "Perez-Hidalgo L" "Garcia AI" "Conde F" "Mata J" "Ellermeier C" "Davis L" "San-Segundo P" "Smith GR" "Moreno S."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
