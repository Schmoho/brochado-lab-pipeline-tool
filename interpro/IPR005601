{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Irreversible binding of T-even bacteriophages to Escherichia coli is mediated by the short and long tail fibres, which serve as inextensible stays during DNA injection. Short tail fibres are exceptionally stable elongated trimers of gene product 12 (gp12), a 56kDa protein. The N-terminal region of gp12 is important for phage attachment, the central region forms a long shaft, while a C-terminal globular region is implicated in binding to the bacterial lipopolysaccharide core [[cite:PUB00074569]]. Long tail fibers consist of a phage-proximal (gp34) and a phage-distal rod, the latter containing two protein trimers (gp36 and gp37). Gp36 is present in the upper part of the distal rod, it forms a complex with gp35 and gp37, binding them through the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively. The upper part of the distal rod has a Î²-structure [[cite:PUB00094388]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03903" "Phage T4 tail fibre"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tail fibre protein p36", "short" "Tail_fibre_p36"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 35, "taxa" 770, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 579, "sets" 0, "proteins" 549, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005601", :literature {"PUB00074569" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Riede I" "Drexler K" "Eschbach ML."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/13.2.605", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The nucleotide sequences of the tail fiber gene 36 of bacteriophage T2 and of genes 36 of the T-even type Escherichia coli phages K3 and Ox2.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "605-16", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 4000929}, "PUB00094388" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hyman P" "van Raaij M."], "ISO_journal" "Biophys Rev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biophys Rev", "title" "Bacteriophage T4 long tail fiber domains.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "463-471", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29204885}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005601", "name" "Tail fibre protein p36", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 85}}}
