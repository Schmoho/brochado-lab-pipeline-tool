{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family are a component of the helicase/primase complex. The helicase generates single stranded DNA by unwinding the double helix at the replication forks, and the primase synthesizes short RNA primers that the polymerase then elongates [[cite:PUB00079961]].  The function of the proteins, which have no known catalytic activity, is unknown, but they have been shown to be distantly related to B-family polymerases with a substantial reduction in nucleotide binding sites and loss of the active site [[cite:PUB00079962]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04010" "DNA helicase/primase complex-associated protein"}, "pfam" {"PF03324" "Herpesvirus DNA helicase/primase complex associated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA helicase/primase complex-associated protein", "short" "HSV_HEPA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 349, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 588, "sets" 0, "proteins" 588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004996", :literature {"PUB00079961" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Weller SK" "Kuchta RD."], "ISO_journal" "Expert Opin.
