{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Gram-negative bacteria, the activity and concentration of glutamine synthetase (GS) is regulated in response to nitrogen source availability. PII, a tetrameric protein encoded by the glnB gene, is a component of the adenylation cascade involved in the regulation of GS activity [[cite:PUB00003738]]. In nitrogen-limiting conditions, when the ratio of glutamine to 2-ketoglutarate decreases, P-II is uridylylated on a tyrosine residue to form P-II-UMP. P-II-UMP allows the deadenylation of GS, thus activating the enzyme. Conversely, in nitrogen excess, P-II-UMP is deuridylated and then promotes the adenylation of GS. P-II also indirectly controls the transcription of the GS gene (glnA) by preventing NR-II (ntrB) to phosphorylate NR-I (ntrC) which is the transcriptional activator of glnA. Once P-II is uridylylated, these events are reversed.</p>\n\n<p>P-II is a protein of about 110 amino acid residues extremely well conserved. The tyrosine which is uridylated is located in the central part of the protein. In cyanobacteria, P-II seems to be phosphorylated on a serine residue rather than being uridylated. In methanogenic archaebacteria, the nitrogenase iron protein gene (nifH) is followed by two open reading frames highly similar to the eubacterial P-II protein [[cite:PUB00005081]]. These proteins could be involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation. In the red alga, Porphyra purpurea, there is a glnB homologue encoded in the chloroplast genome.</p>\n\n<p>Other proteins highly similar to glnB are:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Bacillus subtilis protein nrgB [[cite:PUB00002236]].</li>\n<li>Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybaI [[cite:PUB00001837]].</li>\n<li>GlnK from Archaea and bacteria, an homologue of GlnB protein, which regulates ammonium transport (Amt) proteins [[cite:PUB00059047], [cite:PUB00047830]]</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4co3", "name" "Structure of PII signaling protein GlnZ from Azospirillum brasilense in complex with adenosine triphosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015867", "name" "Nitrogen regulatory protein PII/ATP phosphoribosyltransferase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011322", "name" "Nitrogen regulatory PII-like, alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF039144" "Nitrogen regulatory protein P-II"}, "panther" {"PTHR30115" "NITROGEN REGULATORY PROTEIN P-II"}, "pfam" {"PF00543" "Nitrogen regulatory protein P-II"}, "profile" {"PS51343" "P-II protein family profile"}, "smart" {"SM00938" "Nitrogen regulatory protein P-II"}, "prints" {"PR00340" "PIIGLNB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogen regulatory protein PII", "short" "N-reg_PII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 103, "domain_architectures" 51, "proteomes" 7385, "taxa" 29225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57534, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57359, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44582}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00439", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00439"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002187", :literature {"PUB00003738" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["de Zamaroczy M" "Delorme F" "Elmerich C."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
