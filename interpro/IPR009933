{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several T-DNA border endonuclease VirD1 proteins, which appear to be found exclusively in Agrobacterium species. Agrobacterium, a plant pathogen, is capable to stably transform the plant cell with a segment of its own DNA called T-DNA (transferred DNA). This process depends, among others, on the specialised bacterial virulence proteins VirD1 and VirD2 that excise the T-DNA from its adjacent sequences. VirD1 is thought to interact with VirD2 in this process [[cite:PUB00013102]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07328" "T-DNA border endonuclease VirD1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T-DNA border endonuclease VirD1", "short" "VirD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 130, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 106, "sets" 0, "proteins" 106, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 84}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009933", :literature {"PUB00013102" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Relic B" "Andjelkovic M" "Rossi L" "Nagamine Y" "Hohn B."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
