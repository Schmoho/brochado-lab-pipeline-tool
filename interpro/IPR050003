{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of prokaryotic proteins. Members of this family have a long N-terminal region that resembles HgcA, and a shorter C-terminal region that resembles HgcB, where HgcA and HcgB are a protein pair required for the methylation that converts inorganic mercury into the more toxic organic compound methylmercury, a neurotoxin in humans. The HgcAB-like fusion protein is not currently known to have this activity. Some members have an additional N-terminal methyltransferase domain, while others are encoded adjacent to an uncharacterised methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00153460]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043039" "HgcAB-like fusion protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HgcAB-like fusion protein", "short" "HgcAB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 115, "sets" 0, "proteins" 115, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 86}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR050003", :literature {"PUB00153460" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Podar M" "Gilmour CC" "Brandt CC" "Soren A" "Brown SD" "Crable BR" "Palumbo AV" "Somenahally AC" "Elias DA."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1500675", "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Global prevalence and distribution of genes and microorganisms involved in mercury methylation.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e1500675", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26601305}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR050003", "name" "HgcAB-like fusion protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
