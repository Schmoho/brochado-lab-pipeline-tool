{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Purple acid phosphatases ([ec:3.1.3.2]) are a family of binuclear metallohydrolases that have been identified in plants, animals and fungi.  The best characterized enzyme is from kidney bean, and that enzyme binds Fe<sup>3+</sup>and Zn<sup>2+</sup>ions. The metals bound differ according to source species, for example the enzyme from sweet potato binds iron and manganese [[cite:PUB00010642]].   The structure of the kidney bean enzyme has been solved, and shows a disulfide-linked homodimer, with each monomer having a two-domain structure [[cite:PUB00089454]]. Human acid phosphatase type 7 is also known as purple acid phosphatase long form.  It is associated with bone resorption and microbial killing through its phosphatase activity, and hydroxyl radical production [[cite:PUB00089455]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8brn", "name" "Crystal structure of red kidney bean purple acid phosphatase in complex with an alpha-aminonaphthylmethylphosphonic acid inhibitor"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22953" "ACID PHOSPHATASE RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Purple acid phosphatase-like", "short" "PPA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2816, "taxa" 11718, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20817, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20817, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13950}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
