{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is required for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerases I, II and III, from promoters with or without a TATA box [[cite:PUB00017043], [cite:PUB00017042]]. TBP associates with a host of factors, including the general transcription factors SL1, TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, and -H, to form huge multi-subunit pre-initiation complexes on the core promoter. Through its association with different transcription factors, TBP can initiate transcription from different RNA polymerases. There are several related TBPs, including TBP-like (TBPL) proteins [[cite:PUB00017041]]. TBP binds directly to the TATA box promoter element, where it nucleates polymerase assembly, thus defining the transcription start site.</p>\r\n<p>The C-terminal core of TBP (~180 residues) is highly conserved and contains two 77-amino acid repeats that produce a saddle-shaped structure that straddles the DNA; this region binds to the TATA box and interacts with transcription factors and regulatory proteins  [[cite:PUB00004136]].  By contrast, the N-terminal region varies in both length and sequence.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ytb", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF A YEAST TBP/TATA-BOX COMPLEX"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012295", "name" "TBP domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00408" "TATA-box-binding protein [tbp]"}, "pfam" {"PF00352" "Transcription factor TFIID (or TATA-binding protein, TBP)"}, "panther" {"PTHR10126" "TATA-BOX BINDING PROTEIN"}, "prints" {"PR00686" "TIFACTORIID"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TATA-box binding protein", "short" "TBP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 158, "domain_architectures" 140, "proteomes" 3035, "taxa" 14016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16740, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16336, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10736}, "pathways" 115}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00303", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00303"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000814", :literature {"PUB00017041" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Davidson I."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
