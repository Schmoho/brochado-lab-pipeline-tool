{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family have a Sec-independent twin-arginine tranlocation (TAT) signal sequence, which enables tranfer of proteins folded around prosthetic groups to cross the plasma membrane. These proteins have four copies of a repeat of about 23 amino acids that resembles the β-helix repeat. β-helix refers to a structural motif in which successive β strands wind around to stack parallel in a right-handed helix, as in AlgG and related enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism. The twin-arginine motif suggests that members of this protein family bind some unknown cofactor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011050", "name" "Pectin lyase fold/virulence factor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012334", "name" "Pectin lyase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03808" "TIGR03808 family TAT-translocated repetitive protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03808", "short" "CHP03808"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 1101, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1140, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1138, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 916}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022388", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022388", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03808", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
