{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aminotransferases share certain mechanistic features with other pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes, such as the covalent binding of the pyridoxal-phosphate group to a lysine residue. On the basis of sequence similarity, these various enzymes can be grouped [[cite:PUB00002195]] into subfamilies.</p>\n<p>One of these, called class-IV, currently consists of proteins of about 270 to 415 amino-acid residues that share a few regions of sequence similarity. Surprisingly, the best conserved region does not include the lysine residue to which the pyridoxal-phosphate group is known to be attached, in ilvE, but is located some 40 residues at the C terminus side of the PlP-lysine.</p>\n\n<p>Among the class IV aminotransferases are two phylogenetically separable groups of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (IlvE) ([ec:2.6.1.42]). The last common ancestor of the two lineages appears also to have given rise to a family of D-amino acid aminotransferases (DAAT). This model represents the IlvE family less similar to the DAAT family.</p>\n\n<p>Also included in this group is branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase gloG from the yeast<i>Glarea lozoyensis</i>, which is required for biosynthesis of the mycotoxin pneumocandin, a lipohexapeptide of the echinocandin family [[cite:PUB00089640]]. Transaminase AMT5 from the Alternaria rot fungus is one of many enzymes required for the non-ribosomal biosynthesis of the cyclic depsipeptides known as AM-toxins [[cite:PUB00089814]]. The aminotransferase FGSG_00049 from Fusarium graminearum is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of gramillins A and B, bicyclic lipopeptides that induce cell death in maize leaves but not in wheat, suggesting host-specific adaptation [[cite:PUB00094557]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hhf", "name" "X-ray crystal structure of oxidized human mitochondrial branched chain aminotransferase (hBCATm)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036038", "name" "Aminotransferase-like, PLP-dependent enzymes", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006468" "Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, BCAT1 type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01123" "branched-chain-amino-acid transaminase"}, "panther" {"PTHR42825" "AMINO ACID AMINOTRANSFERASE", "PTHR11825" "SUBGROUP IIII AMINOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase II", "short" "B_amino_transII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7848, "taxa" 28081, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34780, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34396, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24713}, "pathways" 67}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1467", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1467"} {"accession" "GenProp0164", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0164"} {"accession" "GenProp1328", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1328"} {"accession" "GenProp1334", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1334"} {"accession" "GenProp0162", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0162"} {"accession" "GenProp0163", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0163"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
