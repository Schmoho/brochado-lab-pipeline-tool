{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family average 125 in length, roughly half of which is the repetitive and extremely Gly-rich C-terminal region. Virtually all members occur in the Cyanobacteria, in a neighbourhood that includes a radical SAM/SPASM domain, often a marker of peptide modification systems. A key feature in the C-terminal region is the presence of aromatic amino acids in repetitions of motifs such as WXN or FXN, modified by side chain crosslinking to form three-residue aromatic strained cyclophane moieties. The modified RiPP (ribosomally translated and post-translationally modified peptide) natural products are therefore classified as triceptides. Two specific members, recently, were given species-specific names OscA1 and OscA2 [[cite:PUB00152896]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04260" "GrrA/OscA1 family cyclophane-containing rSAM-modified RiPP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GrrA/OscA1 cyclophane-containing rSAM-modified RiPP", "short" "GrrA/OscA1_RiPP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 50, "taxa" 412, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 285, "sets" 0, "proteins" 285, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 238}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1037"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026356", :literature {"PUB00152896" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Nguyen TQN" "Tooh YW" "Sugiyama R" "Nguyen TPD" "Purushothaman M" "Leow LC" "Hanif K" "Yong RHS" "Agatha I" "Winnerdy FR" "Gugger M" "Phan AT" "Morinaka BI."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0519-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Chem", "title" "Post-translational formation of strained cyclophanes in bacteria.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1042-1053", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32807886}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026356", "name" "GrrA/OscA1 cyclophane-containing rSAM-modified RiPP", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
