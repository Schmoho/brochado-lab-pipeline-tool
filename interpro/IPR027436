{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein kinase C, delta type is a member of the novel protein kinase C (nPKC) family. PKC delta plays contrasting roles in cell death and cell survival by functioning as a pro-apoptotic protein during DNA damage-induced apoptosis [[cite:PUB00064560]], but acting as an anti-apoptotic protein during cytokine receptor-initiated cell death [[cite:PUB00064561]]. PKC delta is also involves in tumor suppression [[cite:PUB00064562]], required for oxygen radical production by NADPH oxidase [[cite:PUB00064563], [cite:PUB00064564]] and acts as positive or negative regulator in platelet functional responses [[cite:PUB00064565], [cite:PUB00064566]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>PKC is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that depend on lipids for activity.
