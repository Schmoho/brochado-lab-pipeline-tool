{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes senescence/dehydration-associated proteins from plants and Spartin from animals. This group of proteins share the C-terminal AAA ATPase domain [[cite:PUB00050561]].</p>\n\n<p>Besides its C-terminal AAA ATPase domain, Spartin contains an N-terminal MIT (contained within microtubule-interacting and transport molecules) domain and a -P-P-x-Y- motif. Spastin monomers assemble into hexameric, ring-shaped ATPases that sever microtubules along their lengths \n[[cite:PUB00097770], [cite:PUB00050561]]. In flies, Spartin has been shown to regulates both synaptic development and neuronal survival by controlling microtubule stability via the BMP-dFMRP-Futsch pathway [[cite:PUB00097767]]. In humans, Spartin (also known as SPG20) has been linked to Troyer syndrome, characterised by spastic dysarthria, cognitive impairment, short stature, and distal muscle wasting in addition to lower extremity spastic weakness [[cite:PUB00097769]]. SPG20 has been shown to be recruited to the midbody and participates in cytokinesis [[cite:PUB00097768]].</p>\n\n<p>In plants, this group of proteins have been linked to senescence and dehydration [[cite:PUB00012915], [cite:PUB00097773]]. Different from their animal homologues, they don't have the MIT domain. In Hemerocallis, petals have a genetically based program that leads to senescence and cell death approximately 24 hours after the, flower opens, and it is believed that senescence proteins produced around that time have a role in this program [[cite:PUB00012915]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21068" "SPARTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spartin-like", "short" "Spartin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2046, "taxa" 7015, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5523, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5523, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3491}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045036", :literature {"PUB00097768" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Renvoise B" "Parker RL" "Yang D" "Bakowska JC" "Hurley JH" "Blackstone C."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "SPG20 protein spartin is recruited to midbodies by ESCRT-III protein Ist1 and participates in cytokinesis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "3293-303", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20719964}, "PUB00097769" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Patel H" "Cross H" "Proukakis C" "Hershberger R" "Bork P" "Ciccarelli FD" "Patton MA" "McKusick VA" "Crosby AH."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Genet", "title" "SPG20 is mutated in Troyer syndrome, an hereditary spastic paraplegia.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "347-8", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12134148}, "PUB00097770" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Roll-Mecak A" "Vale RD."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Biol", "title" "The Drosophila homologue of the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein, spastin, severs and disassembles microtubules.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "650-5", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15823537}, "PUB00050561" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7176", "authors" ["Roll-Mecak A" "Vale RD."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06482", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structural basis of microtubule severing by the hereditary spastic paraplegia protein spastin.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "363-7", "volume" "451", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18202664}, "PUB00097773" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kiyosue T" "Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K" "Shinozaki K."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "Cloning of cDNAs for genes that are early-responsive to dehydration stress (ERDs) in Arabidopsis thaliana L.: identification of three ERDs as HSP cognate genes.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "791-8", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8075396}, "PUB00012915" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Panavas T" "Pikula A" "Reid PD" "Rubinstein B" "Walker EL."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
