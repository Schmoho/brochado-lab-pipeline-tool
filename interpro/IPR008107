{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mycoplasma species are unique amongst bacteria in having very small genomes and lacking cell walls, and are wholly dependent on their host for survival, be it in a symbiotic or pathogenic lifestyle [[cite:PUB00010319]]. Some virulent species can quickly adapt to new environments, and utilise a number of cell surface moieties to attach to target cells. Although the most common form of Mycoplasma pathogenesis is respiratory infection, some strains have also been implicated in bacterial vaginosis and rheumatoid arthritis [[cite:PUB00010319]].</p>\n\n<p>An outer membrane lipoprotein, designated P48 on account of its 48kDa molecular weight, was purified from Mycoplasma agalactiae [[cite:PUB00010310]]. It was found to be a potent differentiation/activation factor of human monocytes, and possesses both immunomodulatory and haematopoietic differentiation activities [[cite:PUB00010310], [cite:PUB00010350]]. This is believed to aid the bacterium by recruiting human blood cells to the point of infection, and altering them to allow intracellular invasion by Mycoplasma [[cite:PUB00010350]]. Similar species also use the P48 lipoprotein to invade host cells of sheep and cattle, causing contagious agalactia [[cite:PUB00010350]].</p>\n\n<p>Recently, recombinant studies on the Mycoplasma agalactiaeP48 major surface protein have shown that changing key elements at the genetic level decreases the immunomodulatory effects of the gene product [[cite:PUB00010360]]. This may lead to a novel vaccine for Mycoplasma infections.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF032900" "Macrophage activating lipopeptide"}, "prints" {"PR01733" "LIPPROTEIN48"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mycoplasma P48 major surface lipoprotein", "short" "Mycoplasma_p48"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 208, "taxa" 779, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2231, "sets" 0, "proteins" 627, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 510}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008107", :literature {"PUB00010310" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hall RE" "Agarwal S" "Kestler DP" "Cobb JA" "Goldstein KM" "Chang NS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
