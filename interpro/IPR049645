{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the geranyl diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase and related proteins mainly found in Actinomycetes. This enzyme catalyses the SAM-dependent methylation of geranyl diphosphate to yield (E)-2-methylgeranyl diphosphate [[cite:PUB00151214]]. This enzymatic reaction is important step in the biosynthesis of 2-methylisonorneol (2-MIB), which is responsible for taste and odour problems in drinking water. Geranyl diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase adopts typical methyltransferase fold that assembles into an unique homohexamer ([pdbe:3VC1], [pdbe:4F84]) [[cite:PUB00153069], [cite:PUB00058431]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3vc1", "name" "Crystal structure of geranyl diphosphate C-methyltransferase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in complex with Mg2+, geranyl-S-thiolodiphosphate, and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041943" "geranyl diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Geranyl diphosphate 2-C-methyltransferase", "short" "GPPMT_Stmyces"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 350, "taxa" 1089, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1008, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1008, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 701}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
