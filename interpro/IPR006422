{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains a small clade of dehydrogenases in gammaproteobacteria which utilise NAD+ to oxidize erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate, a precursor for the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine via 4-hydroxythreonine and D-1-deoxyxylulose [[cite:PUB00002270]]. This enzyme activity appears to have evolved from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose substrate differs only in the lack of one carbon relative to E4P. It is possible that some of the GAPDH enzymes may prove to be bifunctional in certain species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01640" "D-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase [epd]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01532" "erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase", "short" "E4P_DH_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 379, "taxa" 2801, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3038, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3038, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2377}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1633", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1633"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
