{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of plasma glycoproteins includes coagulation factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C and Z, which belong to MEROPS peptidase family S1, subfamily S1A (chymotrypsin, clan PA(S)). All but protein Z are peptidases and are involved in blood coagulation. The precursors contain a signal sequence, propeptide, Gla domain, two EGF domains (although sometimes only one is detected by Pfam), and a trypsin domain. Except for protein Z, they are further cleaved between the second EGF domain and the trypsin domain into light and heavy chains, which are connected by a disulphide bond. Glutamic acid residues in the Gla domain undergo vitamin K-dependent carboxylation, allowing this region to bind calcium and membrane phospholipid [[cite:PUB00015412]]. The propeptide region is important in providing a recognition site for the gamma-carboxylase [[cite:PUB00015698]]. Typically one aspartic acid residue in the light chain is post-translationally modified to erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid [[cite:PUB00015685], [cite:PUB00015647]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009003", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001143" "Coagulation factor X"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S1A, coagulation factor VII/IX/X/C/Z", "short" "Pept_S1A_FX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 653, "taxa" 2360, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6437, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5501, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3692}, "pathways" 51}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
