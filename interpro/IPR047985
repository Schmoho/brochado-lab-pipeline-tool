{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of uncharacterised proteins found mainly in gamma- and betaproteobacteria. They are homologues of StbB that is part of an atypical plasmid stabilisation system. The latter is composed of two proteins, StbA and StbB, which act to balance plasmid physiology. StbA is essential to ensure faithful assortment of plasmid copies to daughter cells, whereas StbB is required for plasmid adequate localisation for conjugation [[cite:PUB00106299]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041292" "StbB family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "StbB-like", "short" "StbB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 788, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 725, "sets" 0, "proteins" 725, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 557}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047985", :literature {"PUB00106299" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Guynet C" "Cuevas A" "Moncalian G" "de la Cruz F."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "The stb operon balances the requirements for vegetative stability and conjugative transfer of plasmid R388.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e1002073", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21625564}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047985", "name" "StbB-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
