{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Synaptotagmin-14/14L/16 proteins. They belong to the synaptotagmin family, which is a group of membrane-trafficking proteins that contain two C-terminal C2 domains (known as C2A and C2B domains). The C2  domain is a Ca2-dependent membrane-targeting module. Most of the synaptotagmins have a unique N-terminal domain (transmembrane region) that is involved in membrane anchoring or specific ligand binding [[cite:PUB00069657]].</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structure of the C2 domain of synaptotagmin has been reported [[cite:PUB00000918]]. The domain forms an eight-stranded β sandwich constructed around a conserved 4-stranded motif, designated a C2 key [[cite:PUB00000918]]. Calcium binds in a cup-shaped depression formed by the N- and C-terminal loops of the C2-key motif. Structural analyses of several C2 domains have shown them to consist of similar ternary structures in which three Ca2-binding loops are located at the end of an 8 stranded antiparallel β sandwich.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In mammals Synaptotagmin-14 (SYT14) is expressed in brain (especially in the cerebellum) [[cite:PUB00069025]].
