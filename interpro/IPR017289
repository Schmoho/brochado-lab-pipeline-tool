{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SH2 domain-containing protein 1A (SH2D1A) is an adaptor protein that appears to regulate B-cell differentiation via switching of SLAM (CD150)-mediated signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00042795]]. The SLAM receptor is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes. SH2D1A inhibits SLAM self-association. SH2D1A acts by blocking the recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to a docking site in the SLAM cytoplasmic region [[cite:PUB00042796]].</p>\n\n<p>Defects in SH2D1A are a cause of lymphoproliferative syndrome X-linked type 1 (XLP1) [OMIM:308240], which is also known as X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLPD) or Duncan disease [[cite:PUB00042797]]. XLP is a rare immunodeficiency characterised by extreme susceptibility to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (HHV-4) (Human herpesvirus 4). Symptoms include severe or fatal mononucleosis, acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, pancytopenia and malignant lymphoma.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1d4t", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE XLP PROTEIN SAP IN COMPLEX WITH A SLAM PEPTIDE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036860", "name" "SH2 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037828" "SH2 domain protein 1A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SH2 protein 1A", "short" "SH2_prot_1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 103, "taxa" 381, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 154, "sets" 0, "proteins" 154, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 114}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017289", :literature {"PUB00042795" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Mikhalap SV" "Shlapatska LM" "Yurchenko OV" "Yurchenko MY" "Berdova GG" "Nichols KE" "Clark EA" "Sidorenko SP."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2004-04-1273", "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "The adaptor protein SH2D1A regulates signaling through CD150 (SLAM) in B cells.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "4063-70", "volume" "104", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15315965}, "PUB00042796" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Shlapatska LM" "Mikhalap SV" "Berdova AG" "Zelensky OM" "Yun TJ" "Nichols KE" "Clark EA" "Sidorenko SP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
