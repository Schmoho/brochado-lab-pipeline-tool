{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents what appears to be a phylogenetically distinct clade, containing Escherichia coli CspD ([swissprot:P24245]) and related proteobacterial proteins within the larger family of cold shock domain proteins. The gene symbol cspD may have been used independently for other subfamilies of cold shock domain proteins, such as for Bacillus subtilis CspD. These proteins typically are shorter than 70 amino acids. In E. coli, CspD is a stress response protein induced in stationary phase. This homodimer binds single-stranded DNA and appears to inhibit DNA replication [[cite:PUB00017061]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02381" "cold shock domain-containing protein CspD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CspD, cold shock", "short" "CspD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 539, "taxa" 3311, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3069, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3069, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2425}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012751", :literature {"PUB00017061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Yamanaka K" "Zheng W" "Crooke E" "Wang YH" "Inouye M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
