{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of YgfN, whose function is not clear. YgfN was identified as a molybdenum-binding subunit of a putative molydbopterin-containing selenate reductase complex consisting of proteins YgfK, YgfM and YgfN [[cite:PUB00042852], [cite:PUB00042853]]. However, another study showed that a mutation in the gene (b2881) encoding this protein conferred sensitivity to adenine, which is associated with impaired synthesis of guanine nucleotides from adenine during purine salvage [[cite:PUB00033239]]. YgfN is also known as XdhD, as it has been suggested to be a molybdenum-containing protein of the xanthine oxidase family [[cite:PUB00033239]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037165", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, molybdopterin binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03313" "molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductase Mo/Fe-S-binding subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdenum-binding protein YgfN/XdhD", "short" "Mo-bd_YgfN/XdhD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 49, "taxa" 392, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 380, "sets" 0, "proteins" 380, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 272}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0726", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0726"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017699", :literature {"PUB00042852" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Bebien M" "Chauvin JP" "Adriano JM" "Grosse S" "Vermeglio A."], "ISO_journal" "Appl.
