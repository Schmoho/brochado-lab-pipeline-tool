{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of putative methyltransferases, including TARBP1 from humans and Trm3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TARBP1 (TAR RNA-binding protein 1) plays a role in HIV-1 infection by binding to the loop region of TAR RNA, a region also bound by RNA polymerase II [[cite:PUB00058122], [cite:PUB00058110], [cite:PUB00058109]]. Its dimerization may have a critical role in its activity [[cite:PUB00043301]]. Trm3 catalyses a specific methylation of the guanosine nucleotide at position 18 of the tRNAs. It is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress, and its activity may play a role on innate response [[cite:PUB00098603], [cite:PUB00098601]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ha8", "name" "Methyltransferase Domain of Human TAR (HIV-1) RNA binding protein 1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12029" "RNA METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable methyltransferase Trm3/TARBP1", "short" "Trm3/TARBP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1549, "taxa" 6239, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3779, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3779, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1221}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
