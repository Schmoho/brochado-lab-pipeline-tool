{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant CRIB domain-containing proteins including RIC2 and RIC4 from Arabidopsis. They belong to the RIC (ROP-interactive CRIB motif-containing protein) family. It has been shown that overexpression of RIC2 in tobacco germinating pollen reduces pollen tube elongation [[cite:PUB00096316]].</p>\n\n<p>ROP1 and ROP6 have been shown to interact with RIC4, which promotes F-actin assembly. Together, they are involved in various processes of F-actin dynamics, cell growth, and plant/microbe interactions [[cite:PUB00096317]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The RIC (ROP-interactive CRIB motif-containing protein) family members act as Rho GTPase (Rop) targets that function in distinct Rop signaling pathways [[cite:PUB00096316]]. RICs interact with multiple ROP GTPases via their conserved CRIB motif,  and link ROP proteins to diverse target molecules that bind to their variable domains [[cite:PUB00096318]]. RICs share several consensus amino acid residues upstream of the CRIB motif and a consensus PSWMXDFK block downstream of the CRIB motif.  Unlike other group members, members of group V, consisting of RIC4 and RIC2, lack the PSWMXDFK block and contain a relatively long N terminus in front of the CRIB motif and a short C terminus [[cite:PUB00096316]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46931" "CRIB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN RIC2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CRIB domain-containing protein RIC2/4", "short" "RIC2/4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 222, "taxa" 869, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 973, "sets" 0, "proteins" 973, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 569}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044509", :literature {"PUB00096316" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Wu G" "Gu Y" "Li S" "Yang Z."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "A genome-wide analysis of Arabidopsis Rop-interactive CRIB motif-containing proteins that act as Rop GTPase targets.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2841-56", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11752391}, "PUB00096317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Venus Y" "Oelmuller R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Plant", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Plant", "title" "Arabidopsis ROP1 and ROP6 influence germination time, root morphology, the formation of F-actin bundles, and symbiotic fungal interactions.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "872-86", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23118477}, "PUB00096318" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yang Z."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Small GTPases: versatile signaling switches in plants.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "S375-88", "volume" "14 Suppl", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12045289}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044509", "name" "CRIB domain-containing protein RIC2/4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
