{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents TfpX/TfpZ family of type IV pilin accessory proteins. Type IV pili (TFP) are important colonisation factors, involved in biofilm formation and attachment to host cells. TFP are divided into five distinct phylogenetic groups. TfpZ and TfpX are homologous pilin accessory proteins identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that belong to group IV pilins [[cite:PUB00106400]]. Member of this family is also FimB, a fimbrial assembly protein that is likely to regulate the fimbrial length [[cite:PUB00151047]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041437" "TfpX/TfpZ family type IV pilin accessory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TfpX/TfpZ-like, type IV pilin accessory protein", "short" "TfpX/TfpZ-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 663, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 528, "sets" 0, "proteins" 528, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 384}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047814", :literature {"PUB00151047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hobbs M" "Dalrymple BP" "Cox PT" "Livingstone SP" "Delaney SF" "Mattick JS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Organization of the fimbrial gene region of Bacteroides nodosus: class I and class II strains.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "543-60", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1675418}, "PUB00106400" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Kus JV" "Tullis E" "Cvitkovitch DG" "Burrows LL."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Significant differences in type IV pilin allele distribution among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) versus non-CF patients.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1315-1326", "volume" "150", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15133094}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047814", "name" "TfpX/TfpZ-like, type IV pilin accessory protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
