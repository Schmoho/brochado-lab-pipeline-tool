{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Gammaherpesvirus latent membrane protein (LMP2) proteins. Epstein-Barr virus (strain GD1) (HHV-4) (Human herpesvirus 4) is a human gammaherpesvirus that infects and establishes latency in B lymphocytes in vivo. The latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) gene is expressed in latently infected B cells and encodes two protein isoforms, LMP2A and LMP2B, that are identical except for an additional N-terminal 119 aa cytoplasmic domain which is present in the LMP2A isoform. LMP2A is thought to play a key role in either the establishment or the maintenance of latency and/or the reactivation of productive infection from the latent state. It modulates B-cell receptor signal transduction through its association with the cellular tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk via specific motifs at the N-terminal tail domain. LMP2A also modulates the immune system reducing infected B cells recognition by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells [[cite:PUB00095179]]. The significance of LMP2B and its role in pathogenesis remain unclear. It is suggested that it may be a negative regulator of LMP2A [[cite:PUB00013138], [cite:PUB00095178]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07415" "Gammaherpesvirus latent membrane protein (LMP2) protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gammaherpesvirus latent membrane protein 2", "short" "Herpes_LMP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 62, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010881", :literature {"PUB00013138" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Lynch DT" "Zimmerman JS" "Rowe DT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
