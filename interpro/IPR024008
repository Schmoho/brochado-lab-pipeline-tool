{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this largely Clostridial protein family contain the signal peptide, for the variant SipW form of the signal peptidase I family. The remainder of this protein, however, differs from families such as Peptidase_M73 ([pfam:PF12389]) and YqxM that share the same signal peptide domain. The two known targets for export by the SipW signal peptidase in Bacillus subtilis act in producing biofilm matrix material, but the function for the proteins in this entry is not known.</p>\n\n<p>Members of this Clostridial family include BsaA from Clostridium perfringens that was recently shown to be a matrix protein of extracellular polymeric substance [[cite:PUB00106814]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04090" "BsaA family SipW-dependent biofilm matrix protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BsaA-like SipW-dependent biofilm matrix protein", "short" "BsaA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 38, "taxa" 181, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 308, "sets" 0, "proteins" 308, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 247}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024008", :literature {"PUB00106814" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Obana N" "Nakamura K" "Nomura N."], "ISO_journal" "NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes", "title" "Temperature-regulated heterogeneous extracellular matrix gene expression defines biofilm morphology in Clostridium perfringens.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "29", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32737303}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024008", "name" "BsaA-like SipW-dependent biofilm matrix protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
