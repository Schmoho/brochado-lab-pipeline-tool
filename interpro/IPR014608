{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents eukaryotic ATP-citrate synthase (ACLY) ([ec:2.3.3.8]), also known as ATP citrate lyase. In bacteria and archaea, ATP citrate synthase is composed of two distinct subunits [[cite:PUB00042606]]. In eukaryotes, ATP citrate synthase is a homotetramer of a single large polypeptide, and is used to produce cytosolic acetyl-CoA from mitochondrial produced citrate [[cite:PUB00042607], [cite:PUB00001411], [cite:PUB00015630], [cite:PUB00016123]]. Acetyl-CoA is the building block for de novo lipid synthesis. As such, ACLY couples energy metabolism with fatty acids synthesis and plays a critical role in supporting cell growth [[cite:PUB00075004]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036511" "ATP citrate synthase, fused large and small subunits"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-citrate synthase", "short" "ATP-citrate_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1185, "taxa" 4527, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2800, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1678}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
