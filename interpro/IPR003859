{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase is responsible for catalysing the transfer of galactose onto proteins or lipids [[cite:PUB00066762]]. Studies on C.elegans have shown that the enzyme is required for susceptibility to pore-forming crystal toxins, together with glycosyltransferase genes bre-1, bre-2, bre-3 and bre-5 [[cite:PUB00064256]].</p>\n\n<p>In mammals, the protein is found in long and short forms. The short form is preferentially located in the golgi complex [[cite:PUB00066763]], where it catalyses the production of lactose in the lactating mammary gland; it may also be responsible for the synthesis of complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides of various glycoproteins, as well as the carbohydrate moieties of glycolipids. The short form is preferentially targeted to the plasma membrane of many cell types [[cite:PUB00066763]], where it functions as a recognition molecule during various cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, by binding to specific oligosaccharide ligands on opposing cells, or in the extracellular matrix.</p>\r\n<p>This entry also includes other members of the glycosyltransferase 7 family, such as xylosylprotein 4-beta-galactosyltransferase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fwt", "name" "Crystal structure of human wild type beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase-1 (B4GalT1) in apo-open monomeric form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02050" "Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase family"}, "panther" {"PTHR19300" "BETA-1,4-GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase", "short" "Galactosyl_T"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 45, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1157, "taxa" 4989, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14235, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12948, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8595}, "pathways" 247}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
