{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family summarizes bacterial proteins related to CpxP, a periplasmic protein that forms part of a two-component system which acts as a global modulator of cell-envelope stress in Gram-negative bacteria. CpxP aids in combating extracytoplasmic protein-mediated toxicity, and may also be involved in the response to alkaline pH  [[cite:PUB00016553]]. Functioning as a dimer, it inhibits activation of the kinase CpxA, but also plays a vital role in the quality control system of P pili. It has been suggested that CpxP directly interacts with CpxA via its concave polar surface [[cite:PUB00061476]]. Another member of this family, Spy, is also a periplasmic protein that may be involved in the response to stress [[cite:PUB00016508]]. The homology between CpxP and Spy suggests similar functions. A characteristic 5-residue sequence motif LTXXQ is found repeated twice in many members of this family [[cite:PUB00055384]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5wo2", "name" "Chaperone Spy bound to Casein Fragment (Casein un-modeled)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09916" "CpxP component of the bacterial Cpx-two-component system and related proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF07813" "LTXXQ motif family protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF034445" "Periplasmic protein chaperone, CpxP/Spy type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LTXXQ motif family protein", "short" "LTXXQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 32, "proteomes" 1893, "taxa" 9576, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14349, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13836, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10536}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012899", :literature {"PUB00055384" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kwon E" "Kim DY" "Gross CA" "Gross JD" "Kim KK."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.489", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "The crystal structure Escherichia coli Spy.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "2252-9", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20799348}, "PUB00061476" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Zhou X" "Keller R" "Volkmer R" "Krauss N" "Scheerer P" "Hunke S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
