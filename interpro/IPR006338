{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents thioredoxin reductase family, including thioredoxin reductase 1 and 2 from animals. This homodimeric, FAD-containing member of the pyridine nucleotide disulphide oxidoreductase family contains a C-terminal motif Cys-SeCys-Gly, where SeCys is selenocysteine encoded by TGA (in some sequence reports interpreted as a stop codon). In some members of this subfamily, Cys-SeCys-Gly is replaced by Cys-Cys-Gly. The reach of the selenium atom at the C-terminal arm of the protein is proposed to allow broad substrate specificity [[cite:PUB00009581], [cite:PUB00009582]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3dgh", "name" "Crystal Structure of Drosophila Thioredoxin Reductase, C-terminal 8-residue truncation"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01438" "thioredoxin and glutathione reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin/glutathione reductase selenoprotein", "short" "Thioredoxin/glutathione_Rdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 83, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1105, "taxa" 4553, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4752, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4751, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2925}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
