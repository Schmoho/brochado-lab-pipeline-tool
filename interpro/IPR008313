{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes proteins from bacteria and fungi. It was originally identified as a protein of unknown function from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which was isolated from a screen to identify novel genes required for meiosis [[cite:PUB00044889]]. Members of this family have since been characterised from Streptococcus pneumoniae (A0A0H2URZ6) and Clostridium perfringens (Q8XNB2), and represent a new glycoside hydrolase family, also known as GH125. This family is the first characterized metal-independent alpha-mannosidase family [[cite:PUB00055745]]. Proteins in this family have been reported to be strict exo-alpha-1,6-mannosidases that operate via a metal-independent inverting catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00055745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3qry", "name" "Analysis of a new family of widely distributed metal-independent alpha mannosidases provides unique insight into the processing of N-linked glycans, Streptococcus pneumoniae SP_2144 1-deoxymannojirimycin complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012341", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008928", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01149" "DUF1237"}, "panther" {"PTHR31047" "MEIOTICALLY UP-REGULATED GENE 157 PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF06824" "Metal-independent alpha-mannosidase (GH125)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF028846" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP028846 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metal-independent alpha-mannosidase", "short" "GH125"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 70, "proteomes" 2097, "taxa" 7343, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8411, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8404, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5990}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008313", :literature {"PUB00044889" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Martin-Castellanos C" "Blanco M" "Rozalen AE" "Perez-Hidalgo L" "Garcia AI" "Conde F" "Mata J" "Ellermeier C" "Davis L" "San-Segundo P" "Smith GR" "Moreno S."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
