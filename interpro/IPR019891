It includes the hemolytic polypeptide streptolysin S from Streptococcus pyogenes. These small, ribosomally produced polypeptide precursors are extensively processed post-translationally. Bacteriocin genes in general are small, highly diverse, and have unusual sequence composition, so they are easily missed by many gene-finding programs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03602" "streptolysin S family TOMM toxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriocin, streptolysin S, precursor", "short" "Bacteriocin_streptolysin_S_pre"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 81, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 72, "sets" 0, "proteins" 72, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019891", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019891", "name" "Bacteriocin, streptolysin S, precursor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
