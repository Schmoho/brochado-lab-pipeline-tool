However, there are some exceptions, such as the reduction of steroid double bonds catalysed by AKR1D enzymes (5beta-reductases); and the oxidation of proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; while the beta-subunits of potassium gated ion channels (AKR6 family) control Kv channel opening [[cite:PUB00096110]].</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, they contain an (α/β)8-barrel motif, display large loops at the back of the barrel which govern substrate specificity, and have a conserved cofactor binding domain. The binding site is located in a large, deep, elliptical pocket in the C-terminal end of the β-sheet, the substrate being bound in an extended conformation. The hydrophobic nature of the pocket favours aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar ones [[cite:PUB00005156]]. They catalyse an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which NAD(P)H cofactor binds first and leaves last [[cite:PUB00096110]]. Binding of the NADPH coenzyme causes a massive conformational change, reorienting a loop, effectively locking the coenzyme in place.
