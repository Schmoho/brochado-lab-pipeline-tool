{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family include enzymes related to SagC, a protein involved in thiazole/oxazole cyclodehydration modifications during biosynthesis of streptolysin S in Streptococcus pyogenes from the protoxin polypeptide (product of the sagA gene). Recent evidence suggests that the YcaO/SagD-like component, not this component, performs an ATP-dependent cyclodehydration [[cite:PUB00064880]]. This protein family serves as a marker for widely distributed prokaryotic systems for making a general class of heterocycle-containing bacteriocins [[cite:PUB00045446]]. Note that this model does not find all possible examples of bacteriocin biosynthesis cyclodehydratases, an in particular misses the E. coli plasmid protein McbB of microcin B17 biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03603" "thiazole/oxazole-forming peptide maturase, SagC family component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiazole/oxazole-forming peptide maturase, SagC family component", "short" "Cyclo_dehy_ocin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019892", :literature {"PUB00064880" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Dunbar KL" "Melby JO" "Mitchell DA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
