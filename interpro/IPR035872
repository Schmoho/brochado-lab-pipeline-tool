The cyclization product, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone ((2S,3S,4S,5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanon-2,3,4,5-tetrol), is a precursor of the valienamine moiety. The valienamine unit is responsible for their biological activities as various glycosidic hydrolases inhibitors.  Two important microbial secondary metabolites, i.e., validamycin and acarbose, are used in agricultural and biomedical applications. Validamycine A is an antifungal antibiotic which has a strong trehalase inhibitory activity and has been used to control sheath blight disease in rice caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor used for the treatment of type II insulin-independent diabetes.  Salbostatin produced by Streptomyces albus also belongs to this family.  It exhibits strong trehalase inhibitory activity [[cite:PUB00086375]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5tpr", "name" "Desmethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthase from Anabaena variabilis (Ava_3858) with NAD+ and Zn2+ bound"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08199" "2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EEVS)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase-like", "short" "EEVS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1119, "taxa" 4344, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2123, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1523}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
