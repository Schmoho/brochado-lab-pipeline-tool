{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PAGK represents a new group of virulence factors that is translocated into the host cytoplasm via bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV). Members are small proteins composed of 70 amino acids. In Salmonella they are secreted independently of the SPI-2 type-III secretion system, T3SS. The OMV functions as a vehicle for transferring virulence determinants to the cytoplasm of the infected host cell. OMVs are released from the cell envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria and comprise a variety of outer membrane and periplasmic constituents, including proteins, phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides, and DNA [[cite:PUB00070005]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15284" "Phage-encoded virulence factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage-encoded virulence factor", "short" "PAGK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 257, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1022, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1022, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 952}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029335", :literature {"PUB00070005" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Yoon H" "Ansong C" "Adkins JN" "Heffron F."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
