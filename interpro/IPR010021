{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins is a part of the IIIA subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases. All characterised members of this subfamily and most characterised members of the HAD superfamily are phosphatases. HAD superfamily phosphatases contain active site residues in several conserved catalytic motifs [[cite:PUB00003337]], all of which are found conserved here.</p>\n\n<p>This family consists of sequences from fungi, plants, cyanobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and Deinococcus. Proteins in this entry Includes phosphatidylglycerophosphatase Gep4 from budding yeasts and phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase 1 (PGPP1) from plants. Gep4 is involved in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine for survival of prohibitin-deficient cells [[cite:PUB00066888], [cite:PUB00066452]]. Chloroplastic PGPP1 is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a phosphoglycerolipid present in chloroplastic thylakoid membranes and has a photosynthetic function [[cite:PUB00094223]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01668" "YqeG family HAD IIIA-type phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase", "short" "PGPP1/Gep4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2803, "taxa" 10511, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8680, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8675, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6318}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
