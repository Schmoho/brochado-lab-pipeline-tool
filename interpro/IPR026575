{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, including GpdQ and CpdA. They belong to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily.</p>\n\n<p>GpdQ (glycerophosphodiesterase Q, also known as Rv0805 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis) is a binuclear metallophosphoesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of mono-, di-, and triester substrates, including some organophosphate pesticides and products of the degradation of nerve agents [[cite:PUB00051193]]. The GpdQ homologue, Rv0805, has 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity [[cite:PUB00083156]].</p>\n\n<p>CpdA hydrolyses cAMP to 5'-AMP. It plays an important regulatory role in modulating the intracellular concentration of cAMP, thereby influencing cAMP-dependent processes [[cite:PUB00060663]]. In Pseudomonas is specifically required for regulation of virulence factors and can also hydrolyse cGMP [[cite:PUB00060664]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3d03", "name" "1.9A structure of Glycerophoshphodiesterase (GpdQ) from Enterobacter aerogenes"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042283", "name" "GpdQ, catalytic alpha/beta sandwich domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07402" "Enterobacter aerogenes GpdQ and related proteins, metallophosphatase domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase GpdQ/CpdA-like", "short" "GpdQ/CpdA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1800, "taxa" 8555, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10116, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10116, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7826}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
