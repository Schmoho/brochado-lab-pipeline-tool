{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein of unknown function, found primarily in phage proteins of about 60 to 75 amino acids in length. It contains a single predicted transmembrane helix in many members. Most sequences also contain a region of predicted intrinsic disorder at the C-terminal rich in basic and acidic residues. Further experimental study is required to determine the function of these proteins. Some proteins are annotated as holins but the source of this annotation is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24126" "Family of unknown function (DUF7394)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7394", "short" "DUF7394"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 173, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 99, "sets" 0, "proteins" 99, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055818", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055818", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7394", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 39}}}
