{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Escherichia coli nucleoid contains DNA in a condensed but functional form. Analysis of proteins released from isolated spermidine nucleoids after treatment with DNase I revealed significant amounts of two proteins not previously detected in wild-type E. coli. Partial amino-terminal sequencing has identified them as the products of rdgC and yejK. These proteins are strongly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that they have important cellular roles [[cite:PUB00010123]].</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents the product of gene yejK, nucleoid associated protein NdpA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00730" "Nucleoid-associated protein YejK [yejK]"}, "panther" {"PTHR38772" "PTHR38772"}, "pfam" {"PF04245" "37-kD nucleoid-associated bacterial protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoid-associated protein NdpA", "short" "Nucleoid_associated_NdpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 1993, "taxa" 9123, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9983, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9966, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7875}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007358", :literature {"PUB00010123" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Murphy LD" "Rosner JL" "Zimmerman SB" "Esposito D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
