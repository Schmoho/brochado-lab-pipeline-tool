{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haem oxygenase  ([ec:1.14.99.3]) (HO) [[cite:PUB00001493]] is the microsomal enzyme that, in animals, carries out the oxidation of haem, it cleaves the haem ring at the alpha-methene bridge to form biliverdin and carbon monoxide [[cite:PUB00002451]]. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. In mammals there are three isozymes of haem oxygenase: HO-1 to HO-3. The first two isozymes differ in their tissue expression and their inducibility: HO-1 is highly inducible by its substrate haem and by various non-haem substances, while HO-2 is non-inducible.  It has been suggested [[cite:PUB00005160]] that HO-2 could be implicated in the production of carbon monoxide in the brain where it is said to act as a neurotransmitter. In the genome of the chloroplast of red algae as well as in cyanobacteria, there is a haem oxygenase (gene pbsA) that is the key enzyme in the synthesis of the chromophoric part of the photosynthetic antennae [[cite:PUB00004905]]. A haem oxygenase is also present in the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae (gene hmuO), where it is involved in the acquisition of iron from the host haem [[cite:PUB00002314]]. There is, in the central section of these enzymes, a well-conserved region centred on a histidine residue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5kzl", "name" "Structure of Heme Oxygenase from Leptospira interrogans"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016084", "name" "Haem oxygenase-like, multi-helical", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01126" "Heme oxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haem oxygenase-like", "short" "Haem_Oase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 97, "domain_architectures" 85, "proteomes" 4272, "taxa" 16605, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15357, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11082}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1591", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1591"} {"accession" "GenProp0828", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0828"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
