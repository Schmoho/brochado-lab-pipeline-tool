{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peroxisome biogenesis factor 2 and 10, also known as peroxin-2/10 are involved in the formation of peroxisomes and matrix protein import. Tey form a retrotranslocation channel together with PEX12, which mediates the export of the PEX5 receptor from peroxisomes to the cytosol, thereby promoting PEX5 recycling [[cite:PUB00057427], [cite:PUB00057428], [cite:PUB00101891]]. Each subunit contributes transmembrane segments that coassemble into an open channel. PEX2 is also involved in the response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mediating 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PNPLA2/ATGL, thereby regulating lipolysis [[cite:PUB00101917]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48178" "PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 2", "PTHR23350" "PEROXISOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peroxisome biogenesis factor 2/10", "short" "PEX2/10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2531, "taxa" 8588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7757, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7757, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5036}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
