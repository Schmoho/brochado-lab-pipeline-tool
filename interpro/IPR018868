{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>BAD is a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is regulated by phosphorylation in response to survival factors [[cite:PUB00044167]]. Binding of BAD to mitochondria is thought to be exclusively mediated by its BH3 domain. Membrane localisation of BAD mediates membrane translocation of Bcl-XL. The C-terminal part of BAD is sufficient for membrane binding. There are two segments with differing lipid-binding preferences, LBD1 and LBD2, that are responsible for this binding: (i) LBD1 located in the proximity of the BH3 domain (amino acids 122-131) and (ii) LBD2, the putative C-terminal Î±-helix-5 [[cite:PUB00044168]]. Phosphorylation-regulated 14-3-3 protein binding may expose the cholesterol-preferring LBD1 and bury the LBD2, thereby mediating translocation of BAD to raft-like micro-domains [[cite:PUB00044169]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fbx", "name" "Crystal Structure of a Zebra-fish pro-survival protein NRZ:Bad BH3 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28540" "BCL2-ASSOCIATED AGONIST OF CELL DEATH"}, "pfam" {"PF10514" "Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, BAD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death", "short" "BAD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 276, "taxa" 1150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 597, "sets" 0, "proteins" 597, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 343}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018868", :literature {"PUB00044167" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kelekar A" "Chang BS" "Harlan JE" "Fesik SW" "Thompson CB."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
