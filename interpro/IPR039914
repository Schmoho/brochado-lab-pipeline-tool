SRP recognises the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide on the ribosome. In eukaryotes this retards its elongation until SRP docks the ribosome-polypeptide complex to the RER membrane via the SR receptor [[cite:PUB00063486], [cite:PUB00100261]]. Eukaryotic SRP consists of six polypeptides (SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68 and SRP72) and a single 300 nucleotide 7S RNA molecule. The RNA component catalyses the interaction of SRP with its SR receptor [[cite:PUB00035999]]. In higher eukaryotes, the SRP complex consists of the Alu domain and the S domain linked by the SRP RNA.  The Alu domain consists of a heterodimer of SRP9 and SRP14 bound to the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of SRP RNA.  This domain is necessary for retarding the elongation of the nascent polypeptide chain, which gives SRP time to dock the ribosome-polypeptide complex to the RER membrane. In archaea, the SRP complex contains 7S RNA like its eukaryotic counterpart, yet only includes two of the six protein subunits found in the eukaryotic complex: SRP19 and SRP54 [[cite:PUB00053948]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12834" "SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE 9 KDA PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Signal recognition particle SRP9-like", "short" "SRP9-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2208, "taxa" 7591, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3516, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3516, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2326}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039914", :literature {"PUB00100261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Lee JH" "Jomaa A" "Chung S" "Hwang Fu YH" "Qian R" "Sun X" "Hsieh HH" "Chandrasekar S" "Bi X" "Mattei S" "Boehringer D" "Weiss S" "Ban N" "Shan SO."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Receptor compaction and GTPase rearrangement drive SRP-mediated cotranslational protein translocation into the ER.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34020957}, "PUB00060331" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Brown JD" "Hann BC" "Medzihradszky KF" "Niwa M" "Burlingame AL" "Walter P."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae signal recognition particle required for its functional expression.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "4390-400", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7925282}, "PUB00053948" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Tozik I" "Huang Q" "Zwieb C" "Eichler J."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkf548", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Reconstitution of the signal recognition particle of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "4166-75", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12364595}, "PUB00035998" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Reyes CL" "Rutenber E" "Walter P" "Stroud RM."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000607", "medline_journal" "PLoS ONE", "title" "X-ray structures of the signal recognition particle receptor reveal targeting cycle intermediates.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "e607", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17622352}, "PUB00011467" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Hsu K" "Chang DY" "Maraia RJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
