{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains a novel genetic system characterised by seven (usually) major proteins including a ParB homologue and a ThiF homologue. It is commonly found on plasmids or in bacterial chromosomal regions near phage, plasmid or transposon markers. It is most common among the beta Proteobacteria. It has been named the system PRTRC, or ParB-Related, ThiF-Related Cassette.
