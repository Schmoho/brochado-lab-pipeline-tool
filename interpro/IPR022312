{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Family X DNA polymerases (PolX) are involved in  DNA repair, being evolutionarily conserved in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and archaea. All DNA polymerases from this family are single-subunit enzymes, lacking the 3'-5' exonuclease activity and displaying very low processivity during primer extension reactions [[cite:PUB00097985]]. Proteins in this family include in the well-characterized mammalian Pol beta; more recently discovered eukaryotic polymerases lambda, and mu; and a template-independent polymerase, terminal transferase (TdT) [[cite:PUB00097986]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>DNA carries the biological information that instructs cells how to exist in an ordered fashion: accurate replication is thus one of the most important events in the cell life cycle. This function is mediated by DNA-directed DNA-polymerases, which add nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) residues to the 3'-end of the growing DNA chain, using a complementary DNA as template. Small RNA molecules are generally used as primers for chain elongation, although terminal proteins may also be used. Three motifs, A, B and C [[cite:PUB00004955]], are seen to be conserved across all DNA-polymerases, with motifs A and C also seen in RNA- polymerases. They are centred on invariant residues, and their structural significance was implied from the Klenow (Escherichia coli) structure: motif A contains a strictly-conserved aspartate at the junction of a β-strand and an α-helix; motif B contains an α-helix with positive charges; and motif C has a doublet of negative charges, located in a β-turn-β secondary structure [[cite:PUB00004955]].</p>\n\n<p>DNA polymerases ([ec:2.7.7.7]) can be classified, on the basis of sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00004647], [cite:PUB00004955]], into at least four different groups: A, B, C and X. Members of family X are small (about 40kDa) compared with other polymerases and encompass two distinct polymerase enzymes that have similar functionality: vertebrate polymerase beta (same as yeast pol 4), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT) ([ec:2.7.7.31]). The former functions in DNA repair, while the latter terminally adds single nucleotides to polydeoxynucleotide chains. Both enzymes catalyse addition of nucleotides in a distributive manner, i.e. they dissociate from the template-primer after addition of each nucleotide. DNA-polymerases show a degree of structural similarity with RNA-polymerases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xa5", "name" "Crystal structure of the pre-catalytic ternary complex of DNA polymerase lambda with a templating A and an incoming 8-oxo-dGTP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11276" "DNA POLYMERASE TYPE-X FAMILY MEMBER"}, "prints" {"PR00869" "DNAPOLX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase family X", "short" "DNA_pol_X"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 729, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2652, "taxa" 10674, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12751, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8410}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
