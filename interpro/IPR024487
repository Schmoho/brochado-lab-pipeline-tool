{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cellulose is necessary for biofilm formation in bacteria and is synthesized by the bacterial cellulose biosynthesis complex (Bcs) which is widespread among beta and gamma proteobacteria [[cite:PUB00075887], [cite:PUB00105928]]. CBP_BcsR is a small subunit of this complex, essential for cellulose secretion [[cite:PUB00105928]]. It may play a regulatory role together with BcsQ subunit as they form a subcomplex with chaperone-like function toward each other [[cite:PUB00151583]]. BcsR stabilizes BcsQ to form monodisperse BcsR2Q2 heterotetramers in solution and BcsQ may play a role in the folding and subsequent stability of BcsR [[cite:PUB00151583]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6yb5", "name" "Orthorhombic crystal structure of a native BcsRQ complex crystallized in the presence of ADP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040717" "cellulose biosynthesis protein BcsR"}, "pfam" {"PF10945" "Cellulose biosynthesis protein BcsR-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cellulose biosynthesis protein BcsR-like", "short" "CBP_BcsR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 179, "taxa" 1458, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1372, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1372, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1073}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024487", :literature {"PUB00151583" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Abidi W" "Zouhir S" "Caleechurn M" "Roche S" "Krasteva PV."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Architecture and regulation of an enterobacterial cellulose secretion system.
