{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains proteins involved in the addition of lysine to phosphatidylglycerol (lysylphosphatidylglycerol synthetase, L-PG synthase) [[cite:PUB00057886]]. L-PG synthase produces lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (L-PG), the major component of the bacterial membrane and responsible for its positive charge. L-PG synthesis contributes to bacterial virulence as it is involved in the cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP) resistance mechanism of the host's immune system (defensins, cathelicidins) and of the competing microorganisms (bacteriocins). This family also includes archaeal glycosyltransferase AglD, involved in S-layer biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00057883], [cite:PUB00057884]], and a number of uncharacterised proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03706" "Lysylphosphatidylglycerol synthase TM region"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00374" "flippase-like domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysylphosphatidylglycerol synthetase/glycosyltransferase AglD", "short" "L-PG_synthase/AglD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 158, "proteomes" 6164, "taxa" 26377, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 59823, "sets" 0, "proteins" 59564, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44985}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
