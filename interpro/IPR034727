{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Kintoun (also known as ktu or dynein assembly factor 2, axonemal) is a cytoplasmic protein conserved from ciliated unicellular organisms to mammals. It is required for cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein arm complexes before intraflagellar transport loads them for the ciliary compartment. Its homologue in single-celled alga Chlamydomonas is known as PF13. A mutation in Ktu/PF13 has been identified in some patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In the absence of Ktu/PF13, both dynein arms (inner and outer) are missing or defective in the axoneme, leading to a loss of motility [[cite:PUB00061923]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03069" "Protein kintoun [DNAAF2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kintoun", "short" "Kintoun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 513, "taxa" 2452, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 881, "sets" 0, "proteins" 881, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 542}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034727", :literature {"PUB00061923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7222", "authors" ["Omran H" "Kobayashi D" "Olbrich H" "Tsukahara T" "Loges NT" "Hagiwara H" "Zhang Q" "Leblond G" "O'Toole E" "Hara C" "Mizuno H" "Kawano H" "Fliegauf M" "Yagi T" "Koshida S" "Miyawaki A" "Zentgraf H" "Seithe H" "Reinhardt R" "Watanabe Y" "Kamiya R" "Mitchell DR" "Takeda H."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature07471", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Ktu/PF13 is required for cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dyneins.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "611-6", "volume" "456", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19052621}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0070286", "name" "axonemal dynein complex assembly", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005737", "name" "cytoplasm", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034727", "name" "Kintoun", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
