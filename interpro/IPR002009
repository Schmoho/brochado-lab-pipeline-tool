{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Bromovirus coat proteins. RNA-protein interactions stabilise many viruses and also the nucleoprotein cores of enveloped animal viruses (e.g. retroviruses). The nucleoprotein particles are frequently pleomorphic and generally unstable due to the lack of strong protein-protein interactions in their capsids. <p>The structure is known for Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) [[cite:PUB00005263]]. It shows novel quaternary structure interactions based on interwoven carboxyterminal polypeptides that extend from canonical capsid Î²-barrel subunits. Additional particle stability is provided by intercapsomere contacts between metal ion mediated carboxyl cages and by protein interactions with regions of ordered RNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8c38", "name" "Contracted cowpea chlorotic mottle virus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01318" "Bromovirus coat protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bromovirus coat protein", "short" "Bromo_CP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 22, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002009", :literature {"PUB00005263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Speir JA" "Munshi S" "Wang G" "Baker TS" "Johnson JE."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00135-6", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structures of the native and swollen forms of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "63-78", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7743132}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005198", "name" "structural molecule activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019028", "name" "viral capsid", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002009", "name" "Bromovirus coat protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 3}}}
