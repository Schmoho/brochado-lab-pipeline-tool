{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:1.9.3.1]) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a component of the respiratory chain complex and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen [[cite:PUB00000581]]. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In eukaryotes, in addition to the three large subunits, I, II and III, that form the catalytic centre of the enzyme complex, there are a variable number of small polypeptidic subunits. This family is composed of the heart and liver isoforms of cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa.  Subunit VIIa has two tissue-specific isoforms that are expressed in a developmental manner. VIIa-H is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle but not smooth muscle. VIIa-L is expressed in liver and non-muscle tissues [[cite:PUB00079539]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7coh", "name" "Dimeric Form of Bovine Heart Cytochrome c Oxidase in the Fully Oxidized State"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036539", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIIa superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00928" "Cyt_c_Oxidase_VIIa"}, "panther" {"PTHR10510" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE POLYPEPTIDE 7A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa, metazoa", "short" "Cytc_oxidase_su7a_met"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 99, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 761, "taxa" 3107, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3023, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3022, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1999}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003177", :literature {"PUB00000581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Capaldi RA" "Malatesta F" "Darley-Usmar VM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
