{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents HTH-type transcriptional regulator RpiR-like family of proteins which includes RpiR, MurR, HexR and some uncharacterised transcriptional regulators mainly from bacteria.</p>\n\n<p>These proteins consist of two domains, a N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal sugar isomerase (SIS) domain that may bind phosphosugars. In E. coli, RpiR negatively regulates the expression of rpiB gene. Both rpiB and rpiA are ribose phosphate isomerases that catalyze the reversible reactions of ribose 5-phosphate into ribulose 5-phosphate [[cite:PUB00002286]]. HexR binds to the promoters of the central metabolic operons and thus it is involved in glucose-responsive regulation [[cite:PUB00150997]]. In addition, HexR also regulates genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, redox potential, and denitrification, suggesting that HexR may play an important role in connecting these major pathways in responses to environmental adaptation. In gammaproteobacteria P. putida and Shewanella oneidensis, binding of the 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphogluconate (KDPG) metabolic intermediate of glycolysis was reported to dissociate HexR from its target DNA [[cite:PUB00150998], [cite:PUB00150999]]. The transcriptional repressor MurR controls the expression of murP and murQ, which are involved in transporting and metabolizing N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) generating N-acetylmuramic acid-6-phosphate (MurNAc-6-P) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P), both are able to bind to MurR and weaken the DNA binding ability of MurR [[cite:PUB00151033]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3iwf", "name" "The Crystal Structure of the N-terminal domain of a RpiR Transcriptional Regulator from Staphylococcus epidermidis to 1.4A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046348", "name" "SIS domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30514" "GLUCOKINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator RpiR-like", "short" "RpiR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5121, "taxa" 19223, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 60229, "sets" 0, "proteins" 60229, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 46513}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047640", :literature {"PUB00151033" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Chen W" "Wu D" "Liu Y" "Wu Z" "Li J" "Zhang SY" "Ji Q."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Molecular basis for cell-wall recycling regulation by transcriptional repressor MurR in Escherichia coli.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "5948-5960", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35640608}, "PUB00150998" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Daddaoua A" "Krell T" "Ramos JL."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Regulation of glucose metabolism in Pseudomonas: the phosphorylative branch and entner-doudoroff enzymes are regulated by a repressor containing a sugar isomerase domain.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "21360-8", "volume" "284", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19506074}, "PUB00150999" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Leyn SA" "Li X" "Zheng Q" "Novichkov PS" "Reed S" "Romine MF" "Fredrickson JK" "Yang C" "Osterman AL" "Rodionov DA."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Control of proteobacterial central carbon metabolism by the HexR transcriptional regulator: a case study in Shewanella oneidensis.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "35782-35794", "volume" "286", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21849503}, "PUB00150997" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Antunes A" "Golfieri G" "Ferlicca F" "Giuliani MM" "Scarlato V" "Delany I."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "HexR Controls Glucose-Responsive Genes and Central Carbon Metabolism in Neisseria meningitidis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "644-54", "volume" "198", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26644430}, "PUB00002286" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sorensen KI" "Hove-Jensen B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
