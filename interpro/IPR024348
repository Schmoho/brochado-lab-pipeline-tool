{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protease is found in polyproteins from the positive-stranded RNA virus of prawns called yellow head virus or gill-associated virus (GAV). The GAV cysteine proteinase (3C-like proteinase) is predicted to be the key enzyme in the processing of the GAV replicase polyprotein precursors, polyprotein 1a and polyprotein 1ab. This protease employs a Cys(2968)-His(2879) catalytic dyad [[cite:PUB00056175]].
