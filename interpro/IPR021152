The NEC1/NEC2 complex, known as the nuclear egress complex (NEC), induces the budding of the capsid at the inner nuclear membrane and its envelopment into the perinuclear space, where the complex promotes the fusion of the enveloped capsid with the outer nuclear membrane and the subsequent release of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00084213]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5doc", "name" "Crystal structure of the Human Cytomegalovirus UL53 subunit of the NEC"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04023" "Nuclear egress protein 1 [NEC1]"}, "pfam" {"PF02718" "Herpesvirus UL31-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL31", "short" "Herpes_UL31"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 78, "taxa" 353, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 372, "sets" 0, "proteins" 372, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021152", :literature {"PUB00035844" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Reynolds AE" "Liang L" "Baines JD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
