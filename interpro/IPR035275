{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Smim3 (Small integral membrane protein 3) also known as NID67 (NGF-induced differentiation clone 67) may be involved in forming or regulating ion channels in neuronal differentiation. It is strongly induced by NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor), both of which cause these cells to differentiate. The amino acid sequence of NID67 is strongly conserved among rat, mouse and human. This family of small membrane proteins is only 60 amino acids long and analysis of the predicted peptide sequence reveals a stretch of 29 hydrophobic and uncharged residues which very likely comprise a trans-membrane region [[cite:PUB00085283]]. SMIM3 has been found highly expressed in adult AML, which was associated with a poor prognosis in adult AML. Knockdown of SMIM3 inhibited the proliferation of AML through regulation of the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, making SMIM3 a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for AML [[cite:PUB00156062]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17307" "Small integral membrane protein 3"}, "panther" {"PTHR37859" "SMALL INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small integral membrane protein 3", "short" "Smim3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 364, "taxa" 1258, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 461, "sets" 0, "proteins" 460, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 317}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035275", :literature {"PUB00085283" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Vician L" "Silver AL" "Farias-Eisner R" "Herschman HR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
