{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry identifies the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis repressor, PhaR and related proteins. The gene for PhaR regulatory protein is found in general near other genes encoding proteins associated with polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granule biosynthesis and utilization. It is found to be a DNA-binding homotetramer that is also capable of binding short chain hydroxyalkanoic acids and PHA granules. PhaR may regulate the expression of itself, of the phasins that coat granules, and of enzymes that direct carbon flux into polymers stored in granules [[cite:PUB00013500], [cite:PUB00013501]]. The C-terminal region is poorly conserved in this family of proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01848" "polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis repressor PhaR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis repressor PhaR", "short" "PHA_reg_PhaR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2188, "taxa" 7037, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7121, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7121, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5573}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0055", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0055"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010134", :literature {"PUB00013500" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Maehara A" "Taguchi S" "Nishiyama T" "Yamane T" "Doi Y."], "ISO_journal" "J.
