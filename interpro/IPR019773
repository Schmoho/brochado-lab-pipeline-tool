{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases constitute a family of tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, all of which are rate-limiting catalysts for important metabolic pathways [[cite:PUB00004640]]. The proteins are structurally and functionally related, each containing iron, and catalysing ring hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids, using tetra-hydrobiopterin (BH4) as a substrate. All are regulated by phosphorylation at serines in their N-termini. It has been suggested that the proteins each contain a conserved C-terminal catalytic (C) domain and an unrelated N-terminal regulatory (R) domain. It is possible that the R domains arose from genes that were recruited from different sources to combine with the common gene for the catalytic core. Thus, by combining with the same C domain, the proteins acquired the unique regulatory properties of the separate R domains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variety of enzymes belong to this family that includes, phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase from Chromobacterium violaceum where it is copper-dependent; it is iron-dependent in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. In humans, deficiencies are the cause of phenylketonuria, the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism [[cite:PUB00003956]], tryptophan 5-hydroxylase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis: the conversion of tryptophan to 3-hydroxy-anthranilate and tyrosine 3-hydroxylase catalyzes the rate limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis:  the conversion of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5l01", "name" "Tryptophan 5-hydroxylase in complex with inhibitor (3~{S})-8-[2-azanyl-6-[(1~{R})-1-(4-chloranyl-2-phenyl-phenyl)-2,2,2-tris(fluoranyl)ethoxy]pyrimidin-4-yl]-2,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-3-carboxylic acid"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036951", "name" "Aromatic amino acid hydroxylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036329", "name" "Aromatic amino acid monoxygenase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000336" "Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase-like", "short" "Tyrosine_3-monooxygenase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1116, "taxa" 4510, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6573, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4034}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
