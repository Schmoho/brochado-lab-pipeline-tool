{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase, N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylase ([ec:2.1.1.72]) and cytosine-N4-specific ([ec:2.1.1.113]) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-4 position of cytosines and the N-6 position of adenine in DNA. In prokaryotes, the major role of DNA methylation is to protect host DNA against degradation by restriction enzymes. There are two major classes of DNA methyltransferase that differ in the nature of the modifications they effect. The members of one class (C-MTases) methylate a ring carbon and form C5-methylcytosine and members of the second class (N-MTases) methylate exocyclic nitrogens and form either N4-methylcytosine (N4-MTases) or N6-methyladenine (N6-MTases). Both classes utilise the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and are active as monomeric enzymes. These proteins show three domains, two of them are conserved across multiple kingdoms (SAM binding and the catalytic domain) [[cite:PUB00000092], [cite:PUB00100208]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00508" "S21N4MTFRASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Restriction/modification DNA-methyltransferase", "short" "RM_Methyltransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5590, "taxa" 25629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 231278, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54363, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 40292}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00088", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00088"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
