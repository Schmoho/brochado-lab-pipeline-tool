{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The PGC-1 family members, including PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta and PRC, are transcriptional coactivators that regulate cell metabolic processes ranging from mitochondrial biogenesis to oxidative respiration [[cite:PUB00083772]]. They target NRF-1, a transcription factor that binds to a palindromic sequence in the cytochrome c promoter and associate with the expression of many genes required for expression and function of the respiratory chain. They also bind to CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and ERRalpha (estrogen-related receptor alpha). However, knockout of individual components in the PGC-1 family can result in diverse phenotypes ranging from early embryonic lethality to complete viability with very mild effects on global mitochondrial content and function. They contain an N-terminal region with a nuclear receptor coactivator signature-LXXLL and a C-terminal region with a RS domain and a RNA recognition motif [[cite:PUB00083772]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15528" "PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA COACTIVATOR 1 PGC-1 -RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PGC-1", "short" "PGC-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1404, "taxa" 4884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5208, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5208, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2122}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034605", :literature {"PUB00083772" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Scarpulla RC."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
