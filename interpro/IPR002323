{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochromes c (cytC) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. <p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC.</p>\n\n<p>Class I includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the haem-attachment site towards the N terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C terminus. On the basis of sequence similarity, class I cytC were further subdivided into five classes, IA to IE. Class IE includes such bacterial proteins as cyt c5, cyt c-555 and Ectothiorhodospira cyt c-551.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6k7c", "name" "Dimeric Shewanella violacea cytochrome c5"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00607" "CYTCHROMECIE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c, class IE", "short" "Cyt_CIE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1328, "taxa" 5793, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35923, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9200, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7003}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002323", :literature {"PUB00003208" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Carter DC" "Melis KA" "O'Donnell SE" "Burgess BK" "Furey WR Jr" "Wang BC" "Stout CD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
