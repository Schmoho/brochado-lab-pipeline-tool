{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a highly conserved cofactor protein required by Type II fatty acid synthases (FASs). Plant fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in both plastids and mitochondria [[cite:PUB00097305]]. In Arabidopsis, eight gene loci can be recognized by sequence homology to encode ACP isoforms, five of which are plastidic ACPs (ptACPs), and three of which appear to be mtACPs [[cite:PUB00097303]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the ptACPs, which includes AtACP1-5 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00097136]]. From phylogenetic studies, they can be classified in two groups, one comprising AtACP1, AtACP2, AtACP3 and AtACP5, the other comprises AtACP4 and ACP homologues from related species. These proteins respond to different abiotic stresses such as salt, drought and deficiencies in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and iron [[cite:PUB00097136]]. AtACP1 (At3g05020), AtACP2 (At1g54580), and AtACP3 (At1g54630) are near constitutively expressed in leaves, roots, and seeds, whereas AtACP4 (At4g25050) is predominantly expressed in leaves and is induced upon illumination of plants and AtACP5 (At5g27200) is preferentially expressed in roots and down-regulated by salt stress [[cite:PUB00097304]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036736", "name" "ACP-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46153" "ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl carrier protein, chloroplastic", "short" "ACP_chloroplastic"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 332, "taxa" 1658, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2408, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2408, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1543}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044813", :literature {"PUB00097303" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Mekhedov S" "de Ilarduya OM" "Ohlrogge J."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Toward a functional catalog of the plant genome.
