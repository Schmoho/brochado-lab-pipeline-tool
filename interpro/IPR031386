{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UCMA is a secreted cartilage-specific protein expressed predominantly in resting chondrocytes. It is secreted into the extracellular matrix as an uncleaved precursor and shows the same restricted distribution pattern in cartilage as UCMA mRNA. This protein is proteolytically processed and contains tyrosine sulfates. It seems to be involved in the negative control of osteogenic differentiation of osteochondrogenic precursor cells in peripheral zones of foetal cartilage [[cite:PUB00075753]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17085" "Unique cartilage matrix associated protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR28647" "UNIQUE CARTILAGE MATRIX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Unique cartilage matrix-associated protein", "short" "UCMA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 265, "taxa" 1114, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 728, "sets" 0, "proteins" 676, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 409}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031386", :literature {"PUB00075753" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Surmann-Schmitt C" "Dietz U" "Kireva T" "Adam N" "Park J" "Tagariello A" "Onnerfjord P" "Heinegard D" "Schlotzer-Schrehardt U" "Deutzmann R" "von der Mark K" "Stock M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
