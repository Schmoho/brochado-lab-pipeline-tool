Most insects contain 12 to 105 genes encoding this family and yet so far only one enzyme (ecdysteroid 22-kinase from Bombyx mori) has characterised substrates (2-deoxyecdysone, ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone). There are good reasons to believe that this family includes kinases that act on other small molecule substrates and that they may function in detoxification processes [[cite:PUB00094481]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02958" "Ecdysteroid kinase-like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ecdysteroid kinase-like", "short" "EcKL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 241, "proteomes" 1484, "taxa" 6577, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16563, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15218, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10047}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
