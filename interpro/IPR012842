{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Type 3 secretion system stator proteins (also referred to HrpE-like proteins), which are the cytoplasmic components of bacterial type III secretion systems [[cite:PUB00097917]]. Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) are used by many different Gram-negative pathogens and symbionts to inject bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells and modulate the interaction with them. This entry includes Type 3 secretion system stator protein SCTL (also known as NolV) from Rhizobium, Type 3 secretion system stator protein SCTL (also known as Yop proteins translocation protein L) from Yersinia enterocolitica and SPI-2 type 3 secretion system stator protein SCTL2 (also known as Secretion system apparatus protein SsaK) from Salmonella typhimurium [[cite:PUB00097916], [cite:PUB00034695], [cite:PUB00097915]]. SCTL and SCTL2 act as regulators of the YscN/SctN and SsaN/SctN2 ATPases activity, respectively. This entry excludes the related protein FliH of the bacterial flagellar apparatus (see [interpro:IPR000563]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02499" "type III secretion system stator protein SctL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type 3 secretion system stator protein SctL/SctL2", "short" "T3SS_SctL/SctL2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 209, "taxa" 2095, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2400, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2400, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1984}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012842", :literature {"PUB00034695" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Blaylock B" "Riordan KE" "Missiakas DM" "Schneewind O."], "ISO_journal" "J.
