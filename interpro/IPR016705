{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins predominantly found in the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, including Photosystem II assembly lipoprotein Ycf48 from Synechocystis sp. [[cite:PUB00067686], [cite:PUB00101111]] and Photosystem II stability/assembly factor HCF136, chloroplastic from Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00101110]].</p>\n\n<p>The photosynthesis system II (PSII) is a multi-subunit pigment-protein complex responsible for water oxidation during oxygenic photosynthesis [[cite:PUB00067686]]. Its assembly is regulated by PSII assembly factors including Ycf48/Hcf136, Psb27 and Psb28. Ycf48/Hcf136 contains the BNR repeats and can be found predominantly in the thylakoid membrane. Ycf48/Hcf136 is required for assembly and repair of an early intermediate in PSII assembly that includes D2 (psbD) and cytochrome b559 [[cite:PUB00067686], [cite:PUB00067687]]. This entry also includes some Ycf48-like proteins that may not affect PSII activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xbg", "name" "Crystal Structure of YCF48 from Thermosynechococcus elongatus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01348" "Photosystem II assembly lipoprotein Ycf48 [ycf48]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017875" "Photosystem II stability/assembly factor, HCF136 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosynthesis system II assembly factor Ycf48/Hcf136", "short" "Ycf48/Hcf136"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 384, "taxa" 2072, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1063, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1056, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 719}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016705", :literature {"PUB00067687" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Rengstl B" "Oster U" "Stengel A" "Nickelsen J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
