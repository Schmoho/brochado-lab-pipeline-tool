{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Riboflavin is converted into catalytically active cofactors (FAD and FMN) by the actions of riboflavin kinase, which converts it into FMN, and FAD synthetase, which adenylates FMN to FAD. Bacteria utilize a single bifunctional enzyme containing the ATP-dependent riboflavin kinase and the FMN adenylyltransferase domains. In contrast, two individual and structurally distinct enzymes, cytidine triphosphate (CTP)-dependent riboflavin kinase (RibK) and FAD synthetase (RibL), catalyze the last two steps of the pathway in archaea [[cite:PUB00042719], [cite:PUB00088845]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents RibK.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vbu", "name" "Riboflavin kinase Mj0056 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii in complex with CDP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023465", "name" "Riboflavin kinase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01285" "Riboflavin kinase [ribK]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Riboflavin kinase, archaeal", "short" "Riboflavin_kinase_archaeal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 200, "taxa" 1387, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1325, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1325, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1155}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
