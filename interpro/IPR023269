{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA (C5-cytosine) methyltransferases (RCMTs) catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to the 5th carbon of a cytosine base in RNA sequences to produce C5-methylcytosine. RCMTs use the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor [[cite:PUB00054125]]. The catalytic mechanism of RCMTs involves an attack by the thiolate of a Cys residue on position 6 of the target cytosine base to form a covalent link, thereby activating C5 for methyl-group transfer. Following the addition of the methyl group, a second Cys residue acts as a general base in the beta-elimination of the proton from the methylated cytosine ring. The free enzyme is restored and the methylated product is released [[cite:PUB00054126]].</p>\n\n<p>Numerous putative RCMTs have been identified in archaea, bacteria and eukaryota [[cite:PUB00014205], [cite:PUB00054127]]; most are predicted to be nuclear or nucleolar proteins [[cite:PUB00054128]]. The Escherichia coli Ribosomal RNA Small-subunit Methyltransferase Beta (RSMB) FMU (FirMicUtes) represents the first protein identified and characterised as a cytosine-specific RNA methyltransferase. RSMB was reported to catalyse the formation of C5-methylcytosine at position 967 of 16S rRNA [[cite:PUB00054129], [cite:PUB00014203]].</p>\n\n<p>A classification of RCMTs has been proposed on the basis of sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00014205]]. According to this classification, RCMTs are divided into 8 distinct subfamilies [[cite:PUB00014205]]. Recently, a new RCMT subfamily, termed RCMT9, was identified [[cite:PUB00054127]]. Members of the RCMT contain a core domain, responsible for the cytosine-specific RNA methyltransferase activity. This 'catalytic' domain adopts the Rossman fold for the accommodation of the cofactor SAM [[cite:PUB00054130]]. The RCMT subfamilies are also distinguished by N-terminal and C-terminal extensions, variable both in size and sequence [[cite:PUB00014205]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>As mentioned above, RCMT9 is a novel subtype of RCMT-related proteins.
