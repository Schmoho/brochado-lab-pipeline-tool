{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial translation elongation factor G (EF-G) catalyses translocation during peptide elongation and mediates ribosomal disassembly during ribosome recycling with the aid of the ribosomal recycling factor (RRF). Human mitochondria contains two EF-G homologues, EF-G1 and EF-G2. This entry represents EF-G2, also known as ribosome-releasing factor 2 (RRF2), which mediates ribosome recycling with human mitochondrial RRF, but lacks translocation activity [[cite:PUB00074125]]. This entry also includes EFG2 homologues from other animals and fungi. Its budding yeast homologue, known as Mef2, is required for respiratory growth and is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance [[cite:PUB00074126], [cite:PUB00074128]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03059" "Ribosome-releasing factor 2, mitochondrial [GFM2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome-releasing factor 2, mitochondrial", "short" "EFG2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1100, "taxa" 3474, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1820, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1820, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1233}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
