{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of mammalian MRVI1 proteins which are related to the lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (JAW1) and the IP3 receptor associated cGMP kinase substrates A and B (IRAGA and IRAGB). The function of MRVI1 is unknown although mutations in the Mrvi1 gene induces myeloid leukaemia by altering the expression of a gene important for myeloid cell growth and/or differentiation so it has been speculated that Mrvi1 is a tumour suppressor gene [[cite:PUB00011374]]. IRAG is very similar in sequence to MRVI1 and is an essential NO/cGKI-dependent regulator of IP3-induced calcium release. Activation of cGKI decreases IP3-stimulated elevations in intracellular calcium, induces smooth muscle relaxation and contributes to the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of NO/cGMP [[cite:PUB00011375], [[cite:PUB00094245]]. Jaw1 is a member of a class of proteins with COOH-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchors and is structurally similar to proteins involved in vesicle targeting and fusion. This suggests that the function and/or the structure of the ER in lymphocytes may be modified by lymphoid-restricted resident ER proteins [[cite:PUB00011376]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b46", "name" "Crystal structure of the SUN1-KASH6 9:9 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15352" "LYMPHOID-RESTRICTED MEMBRANE PROTEIN, JAW1"}, "pfam" {"PF05781" "MRVI1 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MRVI1", "short" "MRVI1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 781, "taxa" 3001, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3875, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3507, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1987}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008677", :literature {"PUB00011374" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Shaughnessy JD Jr" "Largaespada DA" "Tian E" "Fletcher CF" "Cho BC" "Vyas P" "Jenkins NA" "Copeland NG."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1202419", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Mrvi1, a common MRV integration site in BXH2 myeloid leukemias, encodes a protein with homology to a lymphoid-restricted membrane protein Jaw1.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "2069-84", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10321731}, "PUB00011375" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6774", "authors" ["Schlossmann J" "Ammendola A" "Ashman K" "Zong X" "Huber A" "Neubauer G" "Wang GX" "Allescher HD" "Korth M" "Wilm M" "Hofmann F" "Ruth P."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35004606", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Regulation of intracellular calcium by a signalling complex of IRAG, IP3 receptor and cGMP kinase Ibeta.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "197-201", "volume" "404", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10724174}, "PUB00011376" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Behrens TW" "Jagadeesh J" "Scherle P" "Kearns G" "Yewdell J" "Staudt LM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
