{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TASK is a member of the TWIK-related (two P-domain) K<sup>+</sup>channel family identified in human tissues [[cite:PUB00001308]]. It is widely distributed, being particularly abundant in the pancreas and placenta, but it is also found in the brain, heart, lung and kidney. Its amino acid identity to TWIK-1 and TREK-1 is rather low, being about 25-28%. However, it is thought to share the same topology of four TM segments, with two P-domains. TASK is very sensitive to variations in extracellular pH in the physiological range, changing from fully-open to closed in approximately 0.5 pH units around pH 7.4. Thus, it may well be a biological sensor of external pH variations.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>TASK-5 is expressed in the pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, ovary, testis and heart.
