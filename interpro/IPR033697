{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonuclease T2 (RNase T2) is a widespread family of secreted RNases found in every organism examined thus far.  This family includes RNase Rh, RNase MC1, RNase LE, and self-incompatibility RNases (S-RNases) [[cite:PUB00080049], [cite:PUB00080050], [cite:PUB00036440], [cite:PUB00022764], [cite:PUB00080051]].  Plant T2 RNases are expressed during leaf senescence in order to scavenge phosphate from ribonucleotides. They are also expressed in response to wounding or pathogen invasion. S-RNases are thought to prevent self-fertilization by acting as selective cytotoxins of \"self\" pollen. Generally, RNases have two distinct binding sites: the primary site (B1 site) and the subsite (B2 site), for nucleotides located at the 5'- and 3'- terminal ends of the sissile bond, respectively.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes the eukaryotic RNase T2 family members.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1iqq", "name" "Crystal Structure of Japanese pear S3-RNase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036430", "name" "Ribonuclease T2-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01061" "RNase_T2_euk"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease T2, eukaryotic", "short" "Ribonuclease_T2_eukaryotic"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2080, "taxa" 7298, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6814, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6775, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4392}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
