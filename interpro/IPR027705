{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Flotillin proteins are membrane-bound chaperones that localize to lipid rafts, where they may recruit the proteins that need to be localized in lipid rafts to be active and facilitate their interaction and oligomerization. Proteins in this entry include flotillin-1 (also known as reggie-2), flotillin-2 (also known as reggie-1) and their homologues. Flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 associate with membrane microdomains known as rafts [[cite:PUB00066451]]. They play a role in various cellular processes such as insulin signaling, T cell activation, membrane trafficking, phagocytosis, and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling [[cite:PUB00066450]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also include bacterial homologues of Flotillin-1. These bacterial proteins are found in membrane microdomains that may be equivalent to eukaryotic membrane rafts [[cite:PUB00099631]]. Similarly to eukaryotic flotillin proteins, flotillins in bacteria play an essential role in organizing and maintaining the correct architecture of the functional membrane microdomains [[cite:PUB00099632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13806" "FLOTILLIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flotillin family", "short" "Flotillin_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5035, "taxa" 19484, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15623}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027705", :literature {"PUB00066451" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Stuermer CA" "Lang DM" "Kirsch F" "Wiechers M" "Deininger SO" "Plattner H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
