{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of archaeal proteins, including Zinc finger protein HVO_2753 (also known as Small CPxCG-related zinc finger protein) from Haloferax volcanii [[cite:PUB00096940]]. NMR 3D structure analysis revealed the content of four C(P)XCG motifs, suggesting the presence of two zinc-binding pockets. However, only C(P)XCG motifs 2 and 4 (comprising Cys-32 to Cys-35 and Cys-50 to Cys-53) form a zinc binding pocket and binds one zinc atom, while C(P)XCG motifs 1 and 3 (comprising Cys-12 to Cys-15 and Cys-39 to Cys-42) form a four-Cys cluster that do not bind zinc. The four C(P)XCG motifs are critical for protein stability, folding and functionality [[cite:PUB00096940]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40733" "ZINC-RIBBON RNA-BINDING PROTEIN INVOLVED IN TRANSLATION-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger protein HVO_2753-like", "short" "HVO_2753-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 259, "taxa" 1977, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2524, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2524, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2070}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044720", :literature {"PUB00096940" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zahn S" "Kubatova N" "Pyper DJ" "Cassidy L" "Saxena K" "Tholey A" "Schwalbe H" "Soppa J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Biological functions, genetic and biochemical characterization, and NMR structure determination of the small zinc finger protein HVO_2753 from Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32905660}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044720", "name" "Zinc finger protein HVO_2753-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR049683", "name" "Zinc finger protein HVO_2753-like, euryarchaeota", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
