{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteoglycans are heavily glycosylated proteins that can be divided into large hyaluronan-binding proteoglycans like aggrecan, and small proteoglycans including the small leucine-rich repeat protein (SLRP) superfamily. The SLRP family is divided into five classes (class I-V) of structurally and genetically related molecules [[cite:PUB00101409]] which may play a role in the regulation of the extracellular matrix architecture [[cite:PUB00101407]]. This entry includes SLRP family class III proteins, which includes mimecan, epiphycan and opticin which are characterised by a relatively low number of LRRs [[cite:PUB00101409]].</p>\n\n<p>Mimecan, also known as osteoglycin, induces bone formation in conjunction with TGF-beta-1 or TGF-beta-2 [[cite:PUB00063211]]. Its expression can be modulated by growth factors and cytokines. It may play roles in many biological processes, including cellular growth, angiogenesis, and inflammation [[cite:PUB00063209], [cite:PUB00063210], [cite:PUB00063212]].</p>\n\n<p>Epiphycan may have a role in bone formation and also in establishing the ordered structure of cartilage through matrix organisation [[cite:PUB00063220], [cite:PUB00063221]].</p>\n\n<p>Opticin inhibits angiogenesis in the vitreous humor of the eye, and therefore represses neovascularization [[cite:PUB00101408]] and may be involved in collagen fibre organisation via regulation of other members of the SLRP superfamily [[cite:PUB00101407]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032675", "name" "Leucine-rich repeat domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46269" "EPIPHYCAN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mimecan/Epiphycan/Opticin", "short" "Mimecan/Epiphycan/Opticin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 644, "taxa" 2185, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2470, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2470, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1734}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043547", :literature {"PUB00063209" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Tasheva ES" "Ke A" "Deng Y" "Jun C" "Takemoto LJ" "Koester A" "Conrad GW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
