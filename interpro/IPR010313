{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glycine N-acyltransferase (also called aralkyl acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase; [ec:2.3.1.13]). Mitochondrial acyltransferases catalyse the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-CoA to the N terminus of glycine to produce N-acylglycine. These enzymes can conjugate a multitude of substrates to form a variety of N-acylglycines. The CoA derivatives of a number of aliphatic and aromatic acids, but not phenylacetyl-CoA or (indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA, can act as donor [[cite:PUB00036032], [cite:PUB00036033]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7pk2", "name" "Bovine Glycine N-Acyltransferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15298" "L-COA N-ACYLTRANSFERASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycine N-acyltransferase", "short" "Glycine_N-acyltransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 699, "taxa" 2693, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2841, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2841, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1773}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
