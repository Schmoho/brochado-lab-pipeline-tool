{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:7.1.1.9]) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a component of the respiratory chain complex and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen [[cite:PUB00000581]]. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane.</p>\n\n<p>In eukaryotes, in addition to the three large subunits, I, II and III, that form the catalytic centre of the enzyme complex, there are a variable number of small polypeptidic subunits. One of these subunits, which is known as Vb in mammals, V in Dictyostelium discoideum (Slime mold) and IV in yeast, binds a zinc atom. The sequence of subunit Vb is well conserved and includes three conserved cysteines that coordinate the zinc ion [[cite:PUB00000625], [cite:PUB00005218]]. Two of these cysteines are clustered in the C-terminal section of the subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7coh", "name" "Dimeric Form of Bovine Heart Cytochrome c Oxidase in the Fully Oxidized State"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036972", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit Vb superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10122" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT 5B, MITOCHONDRIAL"}, "cdd" {"cd00924" "Cyt_c_Oxidase_Vb"}, "profile" {"PS51359" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb, zinc binding domain profile"}, "pfam" {"PF01215" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit Vb", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_su5b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 127, "domain_architectures" 74, "proteomes" 2344, "taxa" 8084, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4850, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4841, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3121}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00663", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00663"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1426", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1426"} {"accession" "GenProp1637", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1637"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002124", :literature {"PUB00000581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Capaldi RA" "Malatesta F" "Darley-Usmar VM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
