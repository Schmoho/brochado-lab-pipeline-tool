{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The WDR59 family is a group of proteins involved in cellular nutrient sensing and regulation. They play a crucial role in the GATOR (GAP Activity Towards Rags) complex, specifically in the GATOR2 subcomplex, which helps modulate the mTORC1 signalling pathway, thereby influencing cell growth and metabolism [[cite:PUB00152852]].</p>\n\n<p>In fungi, the homologue of WDR59 is called MTC5 (Maintenance of telomere capping protein 5) and has been identified as a component of the SEA complex. This complex associates with the vacuolar membrane and plays a role in intracellular trafficking, autophagy, response to nitrogen starvation, and amino acid biogenesis [[cite:PUB00152849]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes similar uncharacterised eukaryotic proteins such as DDB_G0292056 from Dictyostelium discoideum.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46170" "GATOR COMPLEX PROTEIN WDR59"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GATOR complex protein WDR59-like", "short" "WDR59-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2145, "taxa" 7107, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4142, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4142, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1785}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049567", :literature {"PUB00152849" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Loissell-Baltazar YA" "Dokudovskaya S."], "ISO_journal" "Cells", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10102689", "medline_journal" "Cells", "title" "SEA and GATOR 10 Years Later.
