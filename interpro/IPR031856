{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>YdaS is a transcription factor found in the cryptic prophage Rac of E. coli K12 and represents a novel family within the HigA superfamily as it is distantly related to HigA antitoxins. YdaS can act as a toxin whose expression is regulated by RacR and behaves as a monomer in solution [[cite:PUB00099918], [cite:PUB00099919]]. Previously, it was thought to be an antitoxin that neutralises the toxin YdaT [[cite:PUB00075651]]. This entry also includes some bacteriophage proteins, such as cro from Pseudomonas phage D3 and gene 30 protein from Enterobacteria phage phi80.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bd1", "name" "Structure of the Cro protein from putative prophage element Xfaso 1 in Xylella fastidiosa strain Ann-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010982", "name" "Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15943" "Bacterial toxin YdaS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterial antitoxin YdaS-like", "short" "YdaS_toxin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 489, "taxa" 3224, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3711, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3710, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2666}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031856", :literature {"PUB00075651" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Yamaguchi Y" "Inouye M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
