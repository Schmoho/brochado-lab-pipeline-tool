{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows bacteria to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The enzyme complex consists of a tetramer that has an alpha, beta and 2 gamma subunits. The alpha and beta subunits have catalytic activity and the gamma subunits attach the enzyme to the membrane and are b-type cytochromes that receive electrons from the quinone pool and transfers them to the beta subunit. The sequences in this family are the beta subunit for nitrate reductase I (narH) and nitrate reductase II (narY) for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A few thermophiles and archaea also match the model. A number of the sequences in this set are experimentally characterised, these include: E.Coli NarH ([swissprot:P11349]) and NarY ([swissprot:P19318]) [[cite:PUB00008262], [cite:PUB00009746]], [swissprot:P42176] from Bacillus subtilis, and related proteins from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Paracoccus halodenitrificans (Halomonas halodenitrificans).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3egw", "name" "The crystal structure of the NarGHI mutant NarH - C16A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038262", "name" "Nitrate reductase beta, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10557" "beta subunit of nitrate reductase A (NarH) and similar proteins"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01660" "nitrate reductase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrate reductase, beta subunit", "short" "NO3_Rdtase_bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1800, "taxa" 8163, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8938, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8938, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6871}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1676", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1676"} {"accession" "GenProp1329", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1329"} {"accession" "GenProp1583", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1583"} {"accession" "GenProp1474", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1474"} {"accession" "GenProp0636", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0636"} {"accession" "GenProp1122", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1122"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
