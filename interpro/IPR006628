{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The purine-rich element binding (Pur) protein family protein consists of DNA-binding proteins from animals, plants and bacteria, including PURalpha/beta/gamma from humans, Pur-alpha 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and Transcriptional/translational repressor BpuR from Borreliella burgdorferi. Human Pur-alpha is a highly conserved, sequence-specific DNA-and RNA-binding protein involved in diverse cellular and viral functions including transcription, replication, and cell growth. It has a modular structure with alternating three basic aromatic class I and two acidic leucine-rich class II repeats in the central region of the protein [[cite:PUB00007976], [cite:PUB00103947]]. BpuR binds DNA adjacent to the erp transcriptional promoter. It inhibits transcription from the promoter in combination with BpbA [[cite:PUB00154499], [cite:PUB00154500], [cite:PUB00154501]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8cht", "name" "Crystal structure of human PURA (fragment Glu57-Glu212, PUR repeat I and II)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11680" "Protein of unknown function (DUF3276)", "PF04845" "PurA ssDNA and RNA-binding protein"}, "smart" {"SM00712" "DNA/RNA-binding repeats in PUR-alpha/beta/gamma and in hypothetical proteins from spirochetes and the Bacteroides-Cytophaga-Flexibacter bacteria."}, "panther" {"PTHR12611" "PUR-TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Purine-rich element binding protein family", "short" "PUR-bd_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 47, "proteomes" 2247, "taxa" 8902, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8808, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6198}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006628", :literature {"PUB00015571" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3A", "authors" ["Johnson EM."], "ISO_journal" "Anticancer Res.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Anticancer Res", "title" "The Pur protein family: clues to function from recent studies on cancer and AIDS.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "2093-100", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12894583}, "PUB00007976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Bergemann AD" "Ma ZW" "Johnson EM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
