{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family contain a domain duplication. The characterised member from Acinetobacter johnsonii is polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase (PAP), which can transfer the terminal phosphate from poly(P) to AMP, yielding ADP.

Each domain of this protein family is homologous to polyphosphate kinase, an enzyme that can run in the forward direction to extend a polyphosphate chain with a new terminal phosphate from ATP, or in reverse to make ATP (or GTP) from ADP (or GDP).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3czp", "name" "Crystal structure of putative polyphosphate kinase 2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03708" "polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase", "short" "PolyP_AMP_Tfrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 665, "taxa" 3598, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3350, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3350, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2513}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0840", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0840"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
