{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins which have been proposed to act as cobalt transporters acting in concert with vitamin B12 biosynthesis systems [[cite:PUB00015657]]. Evidence for this assignment includes 1) prediction of a single transmembrane segment and a C-terminal histidine-rich motif likely to be a metal-binding site, 2) positional gene linkage with known B12 biosynthesis genes, 3) upstream proximity of B12 transcriptional regulatory sites, 4) the absence of other known cobalt import systems and 5) the obligate co-localization with a protein (CbtA) predicted to have five additional transmembrane segments.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09489" "Probable cobalt transporter subunit (CbtB)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02459" "cobalt transporter subunit CbtB (proposed)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cobalt transporter subunit CbtB, putative", "short" "CbtB_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1429, "taxa" 6070, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5955, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5955, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4692}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012667", :literature {"PUB00015657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "42", "authors" ["Rodionov DA" "Vitreschak AG" "Mironov AA" "Gelfand MS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
