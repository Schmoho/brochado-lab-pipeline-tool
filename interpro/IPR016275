{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents glucose-6-phosphatases, hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose in the endoplasmic reticulum. It forms, with the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (SLC37A4/G6PT), the complex responsible for glucose production in the terminal step of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, being the key enzyme in homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels [[cite:PUB00097250], [cite:PUB00097251]]. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein cause Glycogen storage disease type Ia. Patients manifest a wide range of clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities, including hypoglycemia, severe hepatomegaly due to excessive accumulation of glycogen, kidney enlargement, growth retardation, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia [[cite:PUB00097249]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000905" "Glucose-6-phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose-6-phosphatase", "short" "Glucose-6-phosphatase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 739, "taxa" 2914, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2398, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2339, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1610}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2089", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2089"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
