{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant seed storage proteins, including Napin, 2S seed storage protein and Conglutin.</p>\n\n<p>Napins are low-molecular weight, basic storage proteins synthesised in rape-seed embryos during seed maturation [[cite:PUB00002425], [cite:PUB00003192]]. Sequence comparisons have revealed that Napin belongs to a diverse protein family, which includes major allergens, trypsin inhibitors and natural anti-fungal proteins. Napin comprises 2 polypeptide chains (MW 9000 and 4000) held together by disulphide bonds. The protein is initially synthesised as a precursor of 178 residues, which is proteolytically cleaved to generate mature Napin chains, with 86 and 29 residues respectively [[cite:PUB00002425]].</p>\n\n<p>Some of the proteins in this family are allergens, with cores that are very resistant to proteolytic digestion and to elevated temperatures of up to 100 degrees C [[cite:PUB00098485], [cite:PUB00046785], [cite:PUB00100200], [cite:PUB00022470]]. Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans [WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994)]. This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vj0", "name" "Crystal structure of a chitin-binding protein from Moringa oleifera seeds (Mo-CBP4)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036312", "name" "Bifunctional inhibitor/plant lipid transfer protein/seed storage helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35496" "2S SEED STORAGE PROTEIN 1-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR00496" "NAPIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Napin/ 2S seed storage protein/Conglutin", "short" "Napin/2SS/CON"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 163, "taxa" 843, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1205, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1152, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 723}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000617", :literature {"PUB00002425" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Ericson ML" "Rodin J" "Lenman M" "Glimelius K" "Josefsson LG" "Rask L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
