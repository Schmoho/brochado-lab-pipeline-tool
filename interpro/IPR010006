{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains a number of phage polarity suppression proteins (Psu) (approximately 190 residues long). The Psu protein of Bacteriophage P4\n causes suppression of transcriptional polarity in Escherichia coli by overcoming Rho termination factor activity [[cite:PUB00013162]].  It has the structure of a golf stick composed of seven helices. Psu is described to have a complicated knotted dimeric conformation. It binds to the hexameric capsomere on the P4 capsid to prevent DNA leakage [[cite:PUB00097466]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07455" "Phage polarity suppression protein (Psu)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage P4, Psu, polarity suppression protein", "short" "Phage_P4_Psu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 399, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 815, "sets" 0, "proteins" 813, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 629}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010006", :literature {"PUB00013162" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Linderoth NA" "Tang G" "Calendar R."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.1996.8325", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "In vivo and in vitro evidence for an anti-Rho activity induced by the phage P4 polarity suppressor protein Psu.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "131-41", "volume" "227", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9007066}, "PUB00097466" {"URL" nil, "issue" "53", "authors" ["Banerjee R" "Nath S" "Ranjan A" "Khamrui S" "Pani B" "Sen R" "Sen U."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The first structure of polarity suppression protein, Psu from enterobacteria phage P4, reveals a novel fold and a knotted dimer.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "44667-75", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23150672}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010006", "name" "Bacteriophage P4, Psu, polarity suppression protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 28}}}
