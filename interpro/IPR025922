{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PilX is a protein from Neissaria meningitidis which is crucial for the formation of bacterial aggregates and adhesion to human cells [[cite:PUB00048516]]. The structure of PilX is similar to all pilins as it has the common α/β roll fold. PilX subunits have surface-exposed motifs which are thought to stabilise bacterial aggregates against pilus retraction. It also illustrates how a minor pilus component can modulate the virulence properties of pili which have a simple composition and structure [[cite:PUB00048516]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045584", "name" "Pilin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038415", "name" "Minor type IV pilin, PilX-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11530" "Minor type IV pilin, PilX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Minor type IV pilin, PilX-like", "short" "Pilin_PilX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 79, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 82, "sets" 0, "proteins" 82, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025922", :literature {"PUB00048516" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Helaine S" "Dyer DH" "Nassif X" "Pelicic V" "Forest KT."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
