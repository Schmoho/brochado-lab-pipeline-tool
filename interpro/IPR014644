It mediates the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins Sm D1 (SNRPD1) and Sm D3 (SNRPD3); such methylation being required for the assembly and biogenesis of snRNP core particles. It also mediates the symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 'Arg-3' to form H4R3me2s. It plays a role in gene imprinting by being recruited by CTCFL at the H19 imprinted control region (ICR) and methylating histone H4 to form H4R3me2s, possibly leading to recruit DNA methyltransferases at these sites. It may also play a role in embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency [[cite:PUB00058102], [cite:PUB00058185], [cite:PUB00058186], [cite:PUB00058187]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4c4a", "name" "Crystal structure of mouse protein arginine methyltransferase 7 in complex with SAH"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036946" "Protein arginine N-methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein arginine N-methyltransferase PRMT7", "short" "MeTrfase_PRMT7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 890, "taxa" 3629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1898, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1710, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1100}, "pathways" 149}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
