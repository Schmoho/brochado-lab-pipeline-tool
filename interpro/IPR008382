{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian protein kinase A anchoring protein 3 (PRKA3) or A-kinase anchor protein 110kDa (AKAP 110) sequences. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP are potent stimulators of sperm motility. Anchoring inhibitor peptides, designed to disrupt the interaction of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), are potent inhibitors of sperm motility. PKA anchoring is a key biochemical mechanism controlling motility. AKAP110 shares compartments with both RI and RII isoforms of PKA and may function as a regulator of both motility- and head-associated functions such as capacitation and the acrosome reaction [[cite:PUB00011239]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPHK1-interactor and AKAP domain-containing proteins are proteins that mediates the subcellular compartmentation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA type II). May act as a converging factor linking cAMP and sphingosine signaling pathways. Plays a regulatory role in the modulation of SPHK1 [[cite:PUB00052585]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10226" "A KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPHK1-interactor/A-kinase anchor 110kDa", "short" "SPHK1-interactor_AKAP_110"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 643, "taxa" 2167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3333, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3333, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 560}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008382", :literature {"PUB00011239" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Vijayaraghavan S" "Liberty GA" "Mohan J" "Winfrey VP" "Olson GE" "Carr DW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
