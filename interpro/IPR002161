{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase subunit, also known as the pdxT/SNO family. This family belongs to a superfamily containing a triad glutamine aminotransferase fold,\ncharacterised by a conserved Cys-His-Glu active site [[cite:PUB00018044]]. Two regions are\nhighly conserved across all taxa, the PGGEST motif and the FHPE(LT) motif [[cite:PUB00018045]].\nPdxT/SNO proteins are an α/β three-layer sandwich containing a seven-\nstranded twisted mixed parallel β-sheet flanked by a six α-helices on\nthe N-terminal stretch of the sheet, four on one side and two on the other [[cite:PUB00018044]]. They are involved in vitamin B6 biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ywj", "name" "Crystal structure of uncharacterized conserved protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03800" "pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase glutaminase subunit PdxT"}, "cdd" {"cd01749" "Glutamine Amidotransferase (GATase_I) involved in pyridoxine biosynthesis"}, "panther" {"PTHR31559" "PYRIDOXAL 5'-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE SUBUNIT SNO"}, "profile" {"PS51130" "PdxT/SNO family profile"}, "hamap" {"MF_01615" "Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase subunit PdxT [pdxT]"}, "pfam" {"PF01174" "SNO glutamine amidotransferase family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005639" "Glutamine amidotransferase, SNO type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase subunit PdxT/SNO", "short" "PdxT/SNO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 50, "proteomes" 4908, "taxa" 17819, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17331, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17323, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13322}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00950", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00950"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
