{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein RED (also known as IK) is found in the nucleus and is a component of the spliceosome [[cite:PUB00090272]]. It is also associated with the spindle pole where it co-localizes with and interacts with the spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD1 during metaphase and anaphase. Depletion of RED shortens the mitotic cycle and MAD1 is incorrectly localized [[cite:PUB00090273]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry also include SPBC1539.02 from the fission yeast and smu-2 from C. elegans. SPBC1539.02 is required for chromosome segregation during meiosis [[cite:PUB00044235]]. SMU-2 and SMU-1 bind to each other as components of the spliceosome and modulate splice site selection of many pre-mRNAs [[cite:PUB00090400]].</p>\n\n<p>Protein RED and related proteins contain an arginine/glutamic acid/aspartic acid repetitive sequence. The region in question has several conserved NLS sequences and a putative trimeric coiled-coil region, indicative that these proteins are expressed in the nucleus [[cite:PUB00016574]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12765" "RED PROTEIN IK FACTOR CYTOKINE IK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein Red-like", "short" "Red-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2264, "taxa" 7784, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4122, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4122, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2652}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039896", :literature {"PUB00090273" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Yeh PC" "Yeh CC" "Chen YC" "Juang YL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
