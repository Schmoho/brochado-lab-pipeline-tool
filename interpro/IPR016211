{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutamate, leucine, phenylalanine, valine and tryptophan dehydrogenases are structurally and functionally related. They contain a Gly-rich region containing a conserved Lys residue, which has been implicated in the catalytic activity, in each case a reversible oxidative deamination reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Glutamate dehydrogenases ([ec:1.4.1.2], [ec:1.4.1.3], and [ec:1.4.1.4]) (GluDH) are enzymes that catalyse the NAD-and/or NADP-dependent reversible deamination of L-glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate [[cite:PUB00001430], [cite:PUB00003424]]. GluDH isozymes are generally involved with either ammonia assimilation or glutamate catabolism. Two separate enzymes are present in yeasts: the NADP-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the amination of alpha-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate; and the NAD-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the reverse reaction [[cite:PUB00002418]] -this form links the L-amino acids with the Krebs cycle, which provides a major pathway for metabolic interconversion of alpha-amino acids and alpha-keto acids [[cite:PUB00004656]].  In rice, glutamate dehydrogenase 3 is mitochondrial.</p>\n\n<p>Leucine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.4.1.9]) (LeuDH) is a NAD-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible deamination of leucine and several other aliphatic amino acids to their keto analogues [[cite:PUB00000302]]. Each subunit of this octameric enzyme from Bacillus sphaericus contains 364 amino acids and folds into two domains, separated by a deep cleft. The nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor binds deep in this cleft, which is thought to close during the hydride transfer step of the catalytic cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Phenylalanine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.4.1.20]) (PheDH) is na NAD-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible deamidation of L-phenylalanine into phenyl-pyruvate [[cite:PUB00002347]].</p>\n\n<p>Valine dehydrogenase ([ec:1.4.1.8]) (ValDH) is an NADP-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible deamidation of L-valine into 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate [[cite:PUB00002221]].</p>\n\n<p>L-tryptophan dehydrogenase catalyses the reversible oxidative deamination of L-tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvate in the presence of NAD+ [[cite:PUB00101896], [cite:PUB00101895]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents glutamate/phenylalanine/leucine/valine/tryptophan dehydrogenases found in a number of bacteria and archaea.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1bw9", "name" "PHENYLALANINE DEHYDROGENASE STRUCTURE IN TERNARY COMPLEX WITH NAD+ AND PHENYLPYRUVATE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000188" "Glutamate/phenylalanine/leucine/valine dehydrogenase"}, "panther" {"PTHR42722" "LEUCINE DEHYDROGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamate/phenylalanine/leucine/valine/L-tryptophan dehydrogenase, bacterial/archaeal", "short" "Glu/Phe/Leu/Val/Trp_DH_bac/arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3343, "taxa" 12128, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13273, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13246, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10117}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
