{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GSTK is a member of the GST family of enzymes which catalyses the transfer of the thiol of GSH to electrophilic substrates [[cite:PUB00083280]]. It is specifically located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, unlike other members of the canonical GST family, which are mainly cytosolic [[cite:PUB00094936]]. The biological substrates of GSTK are not yet known. It is presumed to have a protective role during respiration when large amounts of reactive oxygen species are generated. GSTK has the same general fold as DsbA, consisting of a thioredoxin domain interrupted by an Î±-helical domain and its biological unit is a homodimer [[cite:PUB00030523]]. GSTK is closely related to the bacterial enzyme, 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) isomerase. It shows little sequence similarity to the other members of the GST family [[cite:PUB00030523], [cite:PUB00027979]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yzx", "name" "Crystal structure of human kappa class glutathione transferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03021" "DsbA_GSTK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutathione S-transferase kappa", "short" "GSTK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 566, "taxa" 2042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 963, "sets" 0, "proteins" 962, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 666}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
