{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NahD is a 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate isomerase (also known as HCCA isomerase) converts HCCA, a hemiketal formed spontaneously after ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene by a dioxygenase, into cis-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (cHBPA). This is the fourth reaction in a six-step pathway that converts naphthalene into salicylate [[cite:PUB00019443], [cite:PUB00094935]]. HCCA isomerase is unique to bacteria that degrade polycyclic aromatic compounds. It is closely related to the eukaryotic protein, GSH transferase kappa (GSTK) [[cite:PUB00030523]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2imf", "name" "2-Hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate Isomerase: a Kappa Class Glutathione-S-Transferase from Pseudomonas putida"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03022" "DsbA_HCCA_Iso"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate isomerase NahD-like", "short" "NahD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1664, "taxa" 6279, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10411, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10370, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7882}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
