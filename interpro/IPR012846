{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two groups of proteins form acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate. The type of acetolactate synthase described in this entry also catalyzes the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, an early step in the branched chain amino acid biosynthesis; it is therefore also termed acetohydroxyacid synthase. In bacteria, this catalytic chain is associated with a smaller regulatory chain in an alpha2/beta2 heterotetramer.  Acetolactate synthase is a thiamine pyrophosphate enzyme. In this type, FAD and Mg++ are also found.  Several isozymes of this enzyme are found in Escherichia coli (strain K12), one of which contains a frameshift in the large subunit gene and is not expressed.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6bd9", "name" "Saccharomyces cerevisiae acetohydroxyacid synthase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00118" "biosynthetic-type acetolactate synthase large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetolactate synthase, large subunit, biosynthetic", "short" "Acetolactate_synth_lsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 51, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9666, "taxa" 36554, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44974, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44972, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34441}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1342", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1342"} {"accession" "GenProp0163", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0163"} {"accession" "GenProp0162", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0162"} {"accession" "GenProp0164", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0164"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
