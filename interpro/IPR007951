{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the keratin-associated proteins, PMG type [[cite:PUB00010461]]. The major structural proteins of mammalian hair are the hair keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) and the keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs). In the hair cortex, hair keratins are embedded in an inter-filamentous matrix consisting of KRTAPs which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft as a result of disulphide bonds between cysteine residues. There are essentially three groups of KRTAPs, viz: the high-sulphur (HS) and ultra-high-sulphur (UHS) KRTAPs (cysteine content: 16-30 and >30 mol%, respectively) and the high-glycine/tyrosine (HGT: 35-60 mol% glycine and tyrosine) KRTAPs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05287" "PMG protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Keratin-associated protein, PMG type", "short" "KRTAP_PMG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 147, "taxa" 683, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1477, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1447, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 868}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007951", :literature {"PUB00010461" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Kuhn F" "Lassing C" "Range A" "Mueller M" "Hunziker T" "Ziemiecki A" "Andres AC."], "ISO_journal" "Mech.
