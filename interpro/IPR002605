{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of various adenovirus penton base proteins (also known as Protein III) [[cite:PUB00076673]], from both the mastadenoviridae having mammalian hosts and the aviadenoviridae having avian hosts. The penton base is a major structural protein forming part of the penton which consists of a base and a fibre, the pentons hold a morphologically prominent position at the vertex capsomer in the adenovirus particle [[cite:PUB00005586]]. In mammalian adenovirus there is only one tail on each base where as in avian adenovirus there are two [[cite:PUB00005586]].</p>\n\n<p>The penton base proteins are also Involved in virus secondary attachment to host cell after initial attachment by the fibre protein [[cite:PUB00087145]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01686" "Adenovirus penton base protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_04052" "Penton protein [L2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus penton base protein", "short" "Adeno_Penton_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 79, "taxa" 388, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1514, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1514, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002605", :literature {"PUB00005586" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sheppard M" "Trist H."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90546-2", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Characterization of the avian adenovirus penton base.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "881-6", "volume" "188", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1316685}, "PUB00076673" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5995", "authors" ["Liu H" "Jin L" "Koh SB" "Atanasov I" "Schein S" "Wu L" "Zhou ZH."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1187433", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Atomic structure of human adenovirus by cryo-EM reveals interactions among protein networks.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1038-43", "volume" "329", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20798312}, "PUB00087145" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lyle C" "McCormick F."], "ISO_journal" "Virol.
