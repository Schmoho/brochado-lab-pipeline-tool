{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are zinc-containing enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in a two-step mechanism: a nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion on carbon dioxide, followed by the regeneration of the active site by ionization of the zinc-bound water molecule and removal of a proton from the active site. They are ubiquitous enzymes involved in fundamental processes like photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis and ion transport. There are three evolutionary distinct groups - alpha, beta and gamma carbonic anhydrases - which show no significant sequence identity or structural similarity. Most alpha CAs are monomeric enzymes. The zinc ion is complexed by three histidine residues [[cite:PUB00092017], [cite:PUB00017891]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This subgroup of carbonic anhydrases, restricted to animals, contains isozyme IV and similar proteins such as mouse CA XV. Isozymes IV is attached to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail. In mammals, Isozyme IV plays crucial roles in kidney and lung function, among others [[cite:PUB00092023]]. This subgroup also contains the dual domain CA from the giant clam, Tridacna gigas. T. gigas CA plays a role in the movement of inorganic carbon from the surrounding seawater to the symbiotic algae found in the clam's tissues [[cite:PUB00017889]]. CA XV is expressed in several species but not in humans or chimps. Similar to isozyme CA IV, CA XV attaches to membranes via a GPI tail [[cite:PUB00092022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3fw3", "name" "Crystal Structure of soluble domain of CA4 in complex with Dorzolamide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036398", "name" "Alpha carbonic anhydrase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03117" "alpha_CA_IV_XV_like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbonic anhydrase, CA4/CA15", "short" "CA4/CA15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 473, "taxa" 1728, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1268, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1266, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 831}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
