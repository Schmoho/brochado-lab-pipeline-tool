{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase from baceria and archaea. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase is a metalloenzyme found particularly in archaea and some eubacteria. It is responsble for the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate [[cite:PUB00055097]]. It is distantly related to the iPGAM ([interpro:IPR005995]) characteristic of plants and many eubacteria. The common active site and metal-binding residues of the phosphatase domain are easily identified, but the putative phosphotransferase domain is highly diverged. These proteins are unrelated to the cofactor-dependent PGAM. Activity has been demonstrated for proteins from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) [[cite:PUB00014447], [cite:PUB00014397]], Pyrococcus furiosus [[cite:PUB00014397]], and Sulfolobus solfataricus [[cite:PUB00014464]]. These proteins were initially misidentified as phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01402_B" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase [apgM]", "MF_01402_A" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase [apgM]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02535" "cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, prokaryotes", "short" "ApgAM_prokaryotes"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 761, "taxa" 4283, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5207, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5207, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4003}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
