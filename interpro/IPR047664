{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The SWEET (Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter) is a superfamily of sugar transporters found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotic SWEETs usually have seven transmembrane helices (TMHs), but most prokaryotic SWEETs (SemiSWEETs, [interpro:IPR047662]) have only three TMHs [[cite:PUB00105491], [cite:PUB00151012]]. This entry represents eukaryotic SWEETs, which are specific sugar efflux transporters essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development [[cite:PUB00151012], [cite:PUB00151013]]. They can carry mono- and disaccharides across a membrane following the concentration gradient. In many organisms it mediates glucose transport [[cite:PUB00151012], [cite:PUB00151013]]; in Arabidopsis it is necessary for pollen viability; and two of the rice homologues are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter [[cite:PUB00059211]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10791" "RAG1-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sugar transporter SWEET", "short" "SWEET"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1347, "taxa" 5635, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15150, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9459}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047664", :literature {"PUB00105491" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Jia B" "Hao L" "Xuan YH" "Jeon CO."], "ISO_journal" "Front Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Genet", "title" "New Insight Into the Diversity of SemiSWEET Sugar Transporters and the Homologs in Prokaryotes.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "180", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29872447}, "PUB00151012" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7577", "authors" ["Tao Y" "Cheung LS" "Li S" "Eom JS" "Chen LQ" "Xu Y" "Perry K" "Frommer WB" "Feng L."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimeric complex.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "259-263", "volume" "527", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26479032}, "PUB00059211" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7323", "authors" ["Chen LQ" "Hou BH" "Lalonde S" "Takanaga H" "Hartung ML" "Qu XQ" "Guo WJ" "Kim JG" "Underwood W" "Chaudhuri B" "Chermak D" "Antony G" "White FF" "Somerville SC" "Mudgett MB" "Frommer WB."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09606", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Sugar transporters for intercellular exchange and nutrition of pathogens.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "527-32", "volume" "468", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21107422}, "PUB00151013" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Han L" "Zhu Y" "Liu M" "Zhou Y" "Lu G" "Lan L" "Wang X" "Zhao Y" "Zhang XC."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and transport by the AtSWEET13 sugar transporter.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "10089-10094", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28878024}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0051119", "name" "sugar transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047664", "name" "Sugar transporter SWEET", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
