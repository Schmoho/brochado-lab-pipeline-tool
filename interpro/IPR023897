The unusual UV resistance of bacterial spores is a result of the unique photochemistry of spore DNA coupled with the efficient repair of accumulated damage. Exposure of bacterial spores to UV radiation results in the formation of a methylene-bridged thymine dimer, 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, a spore photoproduct, or SP, as the primary photoproduct. SP accumulates in UV-irradiated spores, however it is rapidly repaired upon germination, thus giving rise to the extraordinary UV resistance of bacterial spores. The repair of SP is catalyzed by the enzyme spore photoproduct lyase (SPL), and involves the direct reversal of SP to two thymines without base excision [[cite:PUB00055040]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4fhd", "name" "Spore photoproduct lyase complexed with dinucleoside spore photoproduct"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04070" "spore photoproduct lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spore photoproduct lyase, firmicutes", "short" "SPL_firmicutes"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 585, "taxa" 1879, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1694, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1694, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1269}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
