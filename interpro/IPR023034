{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SurA in Escherichia coli is a periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase which is necessary for the proper folding of outer membrane proteins (OMP) including OmpA, OmpF and LamB. There are at least two pathways for periplasmic chaperone activity, one involving Skp and DegP, and another involving SurA. It has been proposed that the SurA pathway is the primary pathway for assembly of OMPs, while the DegP/Skp pathway is important for rescuing proteins that fall off of the SurA pathway. However recent proteonomic studies show that only 8 of 23 identified Î²-barrel proteins were negatively affected in a surA knockout mutant [[cite:PUB00053976]]. The decreased OMP included FadL, FecA, LptD, FhuA, OmpX as well as the major OMP OmpA, OmpF and LamB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01183" "Chaperone SurA [surA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase SurA", "short" "PPIase_SurA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1583, "taxa" 7317, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8158, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8158, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6244}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
