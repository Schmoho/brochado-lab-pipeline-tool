{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the human protein of unknown function LOC400499 ([swissprot:Q6ZTK2]) and similar sequences from vertebrates. It has a remarkable high confidence structure prediction showing an extended single β-sheet composed of a single long meander. No obvious sequence repeat is present in the sequence. Some members of this family contain lipovitellin homologous regions additionally to the N terminus of this family. Lipovitellin contains similar open β-structures which are used to bind to lipids suggesting that this family is also involved in lipid binding and storage.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21013" "LOC400499 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LOC400499-like", "short" "LOC400499-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 39, "proteomes" 458, "taxa" 1622, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 649, "sets" 0, "proteins" 626, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 313}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048484", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048484", "name" "LOC400499-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 18, "alignment:full" 529}}}
