{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Rhizobium NolX and Xanthomonas HrpF proteins. The interaction between the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (strain 85-10) and its host plants is controlled by hrp genes (hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity), which encode a type III protein secretion system. Among type III-secreted proteins are avirulence proteins, effectors involved in the induction of plant defence reactions. HrpF is dispensable for protein secretion but required for AvrBs3 recognition in planta, is thought to function as a translocator of effector proteins into the host cell [[cite:PUB00011404]]. NolX, a Glycine max (Soybean) cultivar specificity protein, is secreted by a type III secretion system (TTSS) and shows homology to HrpF. It is not known whether NolX functions at the bacterium-plant interface or acts inside the host cell. NolX is expressed in planta only during the early stages of nodule development [[cite:PUB00011405]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05819" "NolX protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NolX", "short" "NolX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 504, "sets" 0, "proteins" 391, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 311}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008718", :literature {"PUB00011404" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Rossier O" "Van den Ackerveken G" "Bonas U."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
