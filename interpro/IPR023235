{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the FAM105 family, including FAM105A (OTULINL) and FAM105B (OTULIN). Otulin is an ubiquitin thioesterase that specifically removes linear ('Met-1'-linked) polyubiquitin chains to substrates and acts as a regulator of angiogenesis and innate immune response [[cite:PUB00076542]]. FAM105A shares a high degree of similarity with protein otulin; however, FAM105A lacks the conserved active site at position 139 which is replaced by an Asp residue, and does not show deubiquitinase activity [[cite:PUB00076542]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3znv", "name" "Crystal structure of the OTU domain of OTULIN at 1.3 Angstroms."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02055" "Protein family FAM105"}, "pfam" {"PF16218" "Peptidase family C101"}, "panther" {"PTHR33662" "OTU DEUBIQUITINASE WITH LINEAR LINKAGE-SPECIFICITY A-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAM105", "short" "FAM105"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 696, "taxa" 2588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2060, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1967, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1320}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
