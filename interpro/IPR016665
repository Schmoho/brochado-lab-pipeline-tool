{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Sas5 (Something About Silencing 5) subunit from the SAS complex, as well as subunit 14 (TAF14) from transcription initiation factor IID.</p>\r\n<p>The native yeast SAS complex is a trimeric acetyltransferase complex composed of Sas2, Sas4, and Sas5. Sas2 is a member of the MYST protein family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) [[cite:PUB00042744]]. Sas5 is required for maximal histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of the complex, suggesting that it may be required to stabilise the complex or help in substrate recognition. SAS is capable of acetylating both free histones and nucleosomes, and is required for both histone H4 lysine-16 acetylation and histone H3 lysine-14 acetylation. This specific lysine preference corresponds to the role of SAS complex in antagonizing the spreading of Sir proteins at silent loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast). The SAS complex is involved in transcriptional silencing at telomeres and at HML locus, as well as being involved in rDNA silencing.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038704", "name" "YEATS superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016551" "SAS complex, SAS5 subunit/transcription initiation factor IID, subunit 14"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SAS complex subunit SAS5/transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 14", "short" "Sas5/TAF14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 668, "taxa" 1768, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1133, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1076, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 727}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2054", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2054"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016665", :literature {"PUB00042744" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Shia WJ" "Osada S" "Florens L" "Swanson SK" "Washburn MP" "Workman JL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
