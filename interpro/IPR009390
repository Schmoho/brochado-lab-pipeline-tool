{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains MatP (YcbG), which is a component of the MatP/MatS site-specific system that organises the Ter macrodomain (MD) in Escherichia coli (strain K12) and related enterobacteria during replication of the chromosome. In E. coli there are 23 matS sequences, located in the Ter region which is centred on dif. The matS consensus is a palindromic sequence 5'-GTGAC[AG][CT]GTCAC, which is the recognition sequence for MatP. MatP binds to the matS sequences; and is critical for Ter MD formation. Inactivation of matP causes severe defects in chromosome segregation and cell division revealing its role as a major organiser of the Ter MD [[cite:PUB00053967]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Many bacteria have circular genomes that are large in comparison to their cellular dimensions; this imposes the necessity for compaction of the chromosome during cellular growth, replication, transcription, and segregation. Compaction of chromosomes results in the formation of structures called nucleoids. Nucleoids can be generated by a number of different processes: they include unrestrained DNA supercoiling, formation of a chromatin-like structure through the interaction of DNA binding proteins, condensation by structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC)-like proteins, and macromolecular crowding [[cite:PUB00053963]]. Chromosome replication and segregation are intimately linked and tightly controlled to ensure that daughter cells each receive a complete copy of the genome. Chromosomes have replication origin (Ori) and termination (Ter) regions that are diametrically opposed. During the process of chromosome replication and cell division the Ori and Ter regions form two macrodomains (MDs), the Ori MD is centred on migS, a 25 bp sequence, that acts as the cis-acting site for the bipolar positioning of oriC [[cite:PUB00053964]]. The Ter MD is centred on dif (deletion-induced filamentation), which is a resolvase site that reduces chromosome multimers to monomers [[cite:PUB00053965]]. The Ori and Ter MDs are insulated from one and other by non-structural regions and other nucleoids. Chromosome replication initiates bidirectionally from oriC. Within the Ori MD with sister chromatids being located in separate cell halves and with the Ter macrodomain anchored to the cell pole. Cell division occurs with the completion of replication of the Ter region and the subsequent separation of the two sister chromatids [[cite:PUB00053966], [cite:PUB00053967]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038339", "name" "MatP, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01073" "Macrodomain Ter protein [matP]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Macrodomain Ter protein, MatP", "short" "MatP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 226, "taxa" 1742, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1655, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1655, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1285}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009390", :literature {"PUB00053963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Thanbichler M" "Shapiro L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
