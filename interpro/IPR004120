{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 is the etiological agent for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), as well as for tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and HTLV-I associate myelopathy (HAM). A biological understanding of the involvement of HTLV-I and in ATL has focused significantly on the workings of the virally-encoded 40kDa phospho-oncoprotein, Tax. Tax is a transcriptional activator. Its ability to modulate the expression and function of many cellular genes has been reasoned to be a major contributory mechanism explaining HTLV-I mediated transformation of cells. In activating cellular gene expression, Tax impinges upon several cellular signal-transduction pathways, including those for CREB/ATF and NF-kappaB [[cite:PUB00007369]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02959" "HTLV Tax"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTLV Tax", "short" "Tax"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 36, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1296, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1295, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004120", :literature {"PUB00007369" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Jeang KT."], "ISO_journal" "Cytokine Growth Factor Rev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1359-6101(00)00028-9", "medline_journal" "Cytokine Growth Factor Rev", "title" "Functional activities of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax oncoprotein: cellular signaling through NF-kappa B.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "207-17", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11325603}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045893", "name" "positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004120", "name" "HTLV Tax", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 6}}}
