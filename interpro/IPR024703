{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic fascin proteins. Fascins are actin cross-linking proteins that function in the organisation of two major forms of actin-based structures: dynamic, cortical cell protrusions and cytoplasmic microfilament bundles [[cite:PUB00012306]]. In humans there are three fascin isoforms identified: fascin1-3. Fruit flies only have one fascin, also known as protein singed, which links Btl/FGFR signalling to the actin cytoskeleton during Drosophila tracheal morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00071758]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6i18", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF FASCIN IN COMPLEX WITH BDP-13176"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005682" "Fascin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fascin, metazoans", "short" "Fascin_metazoans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 728, "taxa" 3095, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2188, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2044, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1300}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024703", :literature {"PUB00071758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Okenve-Ramos P" "Llimargas M."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.103218", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Fascin links Btl/FGFR signalling to the actin cytoskeleton during Drosophila tracheal morphogenesis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "929-39", "volume" "141", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24496629}, "PUB00012306" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kureishy N" "Sapountzi V" "Prag S" "Anilkumar N" "Adams JC."], "ISO_journal" "Bioessays", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.10070", "medline_journal" "Bioessays", "title" "Fascins, and their roles in cell structure and function.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "350-61", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11948621}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030674", "name" "protein-macromolecule adaptor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051015", "name" "actin filament binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010431", "name" "Fascin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR024703", "name" "Fascin, metazoans", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
