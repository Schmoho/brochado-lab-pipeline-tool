{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TmcA catalyses the formation of N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac4C) at the wobble position of tRNA(Met), by using acetyl-CoA as an acetyl donor and either ATP or GTP [[cite:PUB00056806]]. This modification is thought to ensure precise recognition of the AUG codon by strengthening C-G base-pair interaction and also prevent misrecognition of the near cognate AUA codon. Structurally, TmcA consists of an RNA helicase module fused with a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold [[cite:PUB00050413]]. It has been prososed that an RNA helicase motor driven by ATP hydrolysis is used to deliver the wobble base to the active centre of the GNAT domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038321", "name" "TmcA, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01886" "tRNA(Met) cytidine acetyltransferase TmcA [tmcA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA(Met) cytidine acetyltransferase TmcA", "short" "tRNA_acetyltr_TmcA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 614, "taxa" 3773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3333}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
