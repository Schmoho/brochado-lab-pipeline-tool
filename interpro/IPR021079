{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of methanol-cobalamin methyltransferase B subunit (MtaB) proteins found in bacteria and archaea. Proteins in this family are approximately 460 amino acids in length. MtaB folds as a TIM barrel and contains a novel zinc-binding motif. Zinc(II) lies at the bottom of a funnel formed at the C-terminal Î²-barrel end and ligates to two cysteinyl sulphurs (Cys-220 and Cys-269) and one carboxylate oxygen (Glu-164). The function of this protein is to catalyse the cleavage of the C-O bond in methanol by an SN2 mechanism. It complexes with MtaA and MtaC to perform this function [[cite:PUB00047666]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12176" "Methanol-cobalamin methyltransferase B subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methanol-cobalamin methyltransferase, B subunit", "short" "MeOH-cob_MeTrfase_bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 81, "taxa" 743, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 732, "sets" 0, "proteins" 729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 612}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
