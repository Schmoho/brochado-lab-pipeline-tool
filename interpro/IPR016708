{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aspartoacylase (ASPA) is the N-acetylaspartate- (NAA)-hydrolysing enzyme. It catalyses the deacetylation of N-acetyl-L-aspartate to produce L-aspartate and acetate. N-phosphonomethyl-L-aspartate is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme [[cite:PUB00043513]]. There is a high concentration of (NAA) in neurons of the central nervous system, which is used as an indicator of neuronal viability. The myelin-associated pathology; Canavan disease (also known as spongy degeneration of the brain), is an inherited childhood disorder that results from a mutation of ASPA. The dysmyelination that results from the inactivation of ASPA is characterised by selective decreases as well as some increases in specific lipids [[cite:PUB00043514]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q4z", "name" "Ensemble refinement of the protein crystal structure of an aspartoacylase from Rattus norvegicus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00704" "Probable aspartoacylase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018001" "Aspartoacylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartoacylase", "short" "Aspartoacylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 630, "taxa" 2988, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2286, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2245, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1488}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
