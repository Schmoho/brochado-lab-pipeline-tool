Discovered in Bacillus cereus, BREX was shown to allow phage adsorption but blocking phage DNA replication. BREX systems are encoded by single operons within genetic defense islands, and are currently categorised into six subtypes based on the number of genes in each system (typically between four and eight) and sequence-based functional annotation of proteins encoded by those genes [[cite:PUB00093365]]. All known BREX systems have two genes in common. The first contains an alkaline phosphatase domain and the second contains an ATPase domain [[cite:PUB00093365]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033453" "BREX-3 system P-loop-containing protein BrxF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BREX-3 system BrxF", "short" "BREX_3_BrxF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 180, "taxa" 1428, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 695, "sets" 0, "proteins" 695, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 527}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048067", :literature {"PUB00093365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Goldfarb T" "Sberro H" "Weinstock E" "Cohen O" "Doron S" "Charpak-Amikam Y" "Afik S" "Ofir G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "BREX is a novel phage resistance system widespread in microbial genomes.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "169-83", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25452498}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048067", "name" "BREX-3 system BrxF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
