They are also essential dietary nutrients in animals. Carotenoid oxygenases cleave a variety of carotenoids into a range of biologically important products, including apocarotenoids in plants that function as hormones, pigments, flavours, floral scents and defence compounds, and retinoids in animals that function as vitamins, visual pigments and signalling molecules [[cite:PUB00016926]].  Examples of carotenoid oxygenases include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Beta,beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase (BCDO1) from animals, which cleaves β-carotene symmetrically at the central double bond to yield two molecules of retinal [[cite:PUB00016926]].</li>\n<li>Carotenoid-cleaving dioxygenase, mitochondrial (BCDO2) from animals, which cleaves β-carotene asymmetrically to apo-10'-beta-carotenal and beta-ionone, the latter being converted to retinoic acid.  Lycopene is also oxidatively cleaved [[cite:PUB00016926], [cite:PUB00100269], [cite:PUB00100266]].</li>\n<li>Carotenoid 9,10(9',10')-cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) from plants, which cleaves a variety of carotenoids symmetrically at both the 9-10 and 9'-10' double bonds and catalyzes the formation of 4,9-dimethyldodeca-2,4,6,8,10-pentaene-1,12-dialdehyde from zeaxanthin [[cite:PUB00100270]].</li>\n<li>9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED1/2) from plants, which cleaves 9-cis xanthophylls to xanthoxin, a precursor of the hormone abscisic acid [[cite:PUB00016927]].</li>\n<li>Apocarotenoid-15,15'-oxygenase (ACOX) from bacteria and cyanobacteria, which converts beta-apocarotenals rather than β-carotene into retinal.  This protein has a seven-bladed β-propeller structure with four histidines that hold the iron active centre [[cite:PUB00016929]].</li>\n<li>Retinoid isomerohydrolase (RPE65) from animals, which in its soluble form binds all-trans retinol, and in its membrane-bound form binds all-trans retinyl esters. RPE65 is important for the production of 11-cis retinal during visual pigment regeneration [[cite:PUB00016930], [cite:PUB00100267], [cite:PUB00100268]].</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4rsc", "name" "Crystal structure of RPE65 in complex with emixustat and palmitate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03055" "Retinal pigment epithelial membrane protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR10543" "BETA-CAROTENE DIOXYGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carotenoid oxygenase", "short" "Carotenoid_Oase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 66, "domain_architectures" 265, "proteomes" 3768, "taxa" 14920, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30509, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29578, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19236}, "pathways" 76}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1703", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1703"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
