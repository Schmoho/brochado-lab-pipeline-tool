{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the bacterial ceramide synthase BcerS from Caulobacter crescentus, which is involved in de novo bacterial ceramide synthesis [[cite:PUB00100723], [cite:PUB00100724]]. It catalyses the condensation of 3-oxosphinganine with an acyl-CoA to generate oxidized ceramides [[cite:PUB00100724]]. It may have a preference for monounsaturated acyl-CoA substrates, as it has a threefold greater preference for C16:1-CoA over C16:0-CoA as a substrate in vitro [[cite:PUB00100724]]. The biosynthetic steps of ceramide synthesis in bacteria occur in a different order from that in eukaryotes and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the bacterial and eukaryotic ceramide pathways evolved independently [[cite:PUB00100724]].
