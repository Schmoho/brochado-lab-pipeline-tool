{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The clarin family consists of clarin-1, clarin-2 and clarin-3. Clarin-1 is a four-transmembrane protein expressed in cochlear hair cells and neural retina. It is also known as Usher syndrome type-3 protein as mutations in the gene coding for this protein cause Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3), which is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterised by the association of retinitis pigmentosa and sensorineural deafness [[cite:PUB00061750]]. It may have a role in the excitatory ribbon synapse junctions between hair cells and cochlear ganglion cells, and presumably also in analogous synapses within the retina [[cite:PUB00061749]]. The function of clarin-2 and clarin-3 is not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31548" "CLARIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Clarin", "short" "Clarin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 911, "taxa" 3627, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2958, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2958, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2092}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026748", :literature {"PUB00061749" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Adato A" "Vreugde S" "Joensuu T" "Avidan N" "Hamalainen R" "Belenkiy O" "Olender T" "Bonne-Tamir B" "Ben-Asher E" "Espinos C" "Millan JM" "Lehesjoki AE" "Flannery JG" "Avraham KB" "Pietrokovski S" "Sankila EM" "Beckmann JS" "Lancet D."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
