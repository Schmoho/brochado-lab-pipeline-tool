{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains ribonuclease P (Rnp) proteins from eukaryotes and archaea. Rnp is a ubiquitous ribozyme that catalyzes a Mg2 -dependent hydrolysis to remove the 5'-leader sequence of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) [[cite:PUB00006321], [cite:PUB00100655]]. Archaeal and eukaryotic RNase P consist of a single RNA and archaeal RNase P has four or five proteins, while eukaryotic RNase P consists of 9 or 10 proteins. Eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNAs cooperatively function with protein subunits in catalysis [[cite:PUB00007201]].</p>\n\n<p>Human RNase P is composed of a singular protein Pop1 and three subcomplexes, the Rpp20-Rpp25 heterodimer, Pop5-Rpp14-(Rpp30)2-Rpp40 heteropentamer, and Rpp21-Rpp29-Rpp38 heterotrimer. Although both Pop5 and Rpp14 have similar protein structure, they share a very limited sequence similarity. Moreover, the C-terminal fragments after the conserved Î² sheets in Pop5 and Rpp14 exhibit distinct structural features that mediate interactions with Pop1 and Rpp40, respectively [[cite:PUB00007201]].</p>\n\n<p>In the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3, RNase P is composed of the RNase P RNA (pRNA) and five proteins (PhoPop5, PhoRpp38, PhoRpp21, PhoRpp29, and PhoRpp30) [[cite:PUB00097410], [cite:PUB00097413]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry include Rnp2 (also known as Pop5) from archaea and Pop5/Rpp14 from humans  [[cite:PUB00007201]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2czv", "name" "Crystal structure of archeal RNase P protein ph1481p in complex with ph1877p"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038085", "name" "RNase P subunit Pop5/Rpp14/Rnp2-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00755" "Ribonuclease P protein component 2 [rnp2]"}, "pfam" {"PF01900" "Rpp14/Pop5 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNase P subunit Pop5/Rpp14/Rnp2-like", "short" "Pop5/Rpp14/Rnp2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 85, "proteomes" 2693, "taxa" 10228, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7196, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7169, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5178}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
