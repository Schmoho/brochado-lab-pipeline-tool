{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In pea (Pisum sativum), the protein-lysine methyltransferase (PsLSMT, also known as RBCMT) catalyses the trimethylation of Lys-14 in the large subunit (LS) of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) [[cite:PUB00014357]]. Arabidopsis homologue of RBCMT, LSMT, is a protein-lysine methyltransferase methylating chloroplastic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolases [[cite:PUB00096033]]. The sequence conservation pattern and structure analysis of the SET domain provides clues regarding the possible active site residues of the domain. There are three conserved sequence motifs in most of the SET domain. The N-terminal motif (I) has characteristic glycines. The central motif (II) has a distinct pattern of polar and charged residues (Asn, His). The C-terminal conserved motif (III) has a characteristic dyad of polar residues and the hydrophobic residue tyrosine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046341", "name" "SET domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51583" "Plant LSMT protein-lysine methyltransferase family profile"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009328" "RuBisCO methyltransferase with SET domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rubisco LSMT methyltransferase, plant", "short" "Rubisco_LSMT_MeTrfase_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 226, "taxa" 845, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 704, "sets" 0, "proteins" 684, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 394}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
