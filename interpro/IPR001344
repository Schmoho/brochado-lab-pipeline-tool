{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The light-harvesting complex (LHC) consists of chlorophylls A and B and the chlorophyll A-B binding protein. LHC functions as a light receptor that captures and delivers excitation energy to photosystems I and II with which it is closely associated. Under changing light conditions, the reversible phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCII) represents a system for balancing the excitation energy between the two photosystems [[cite:PUB00015383]].</p>\r\n<p>The N terminus of the chlorophyll A-B binding protein extends into the stroma where it is involved with adhesion of granal membranes and photo-regulated by reversible phosphorylation of its threonine residues [[cite:PUB00015384]]. Both these processes are believed to mediate the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems I and II.</p>\r\n<p>This family also includes the photosystem II protein PsbS, which plays a role in energy-dependent quenching that increases thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the photosystem [[cite:PUB00015385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry is limited to plant and chromista proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8wey", "name" "PSI-LHCI of the red alga Cyanidium caldarium RK-1 (NIES-2137)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21649" "CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chlorophyll A-B binding protein, plant and chromista", "short" "Chloro_AB-bd_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 143, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 338, "taxa" 2377, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11045}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001344", :literature {"PUB00015383" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Liu XD" "Shen YG."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2004.05.065", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "NaCl-induced phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins in thylakoid membranes from the halotolerant green alga, Dunaliella salina.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "337-40", "volume" "569", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15225658}, "PUB00015384" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Yang DH" "Paulsen H" "Andersson B."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01107-8", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "The N-terminal domain of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein complex (LHCII) is essential for its acclimative proteolysis.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "385-8", "volume" "466", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10682866}, "PUB00015385" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Li XP" "Gilmore AM" "Caffarri S" "Bassi R" "Golan T" "Kramer D" "Niyogi KK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
