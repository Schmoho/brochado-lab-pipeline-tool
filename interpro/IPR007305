{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Traffic through the yeast Golgi complex depends on a member of the syntaxin family of SNARE proteins, Sed5, present in early Golgi cisternae. Got1 is thought to facilitate Sed5-dependent fusion events [[cite:PUB00009891]]. This is a family of sequences derived from eukaryotic proteins. They are similar to a region of a SNARE-like protein required for traffic through the Golgi complex, SFT2 protein ([swissprot:P38166]) [[cite:PUB00015208]]. This is a conserved protein with four putative transmembrane helices, thought to be involved in vesicular transport in later Golgi compartments [[cite:PUB00009891]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04178" "Got1/Sft2-like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesicle transport protein, Got1/SFT2-like", "short" "Vesicle_transpt_Got1/SFT2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 206, "proteomes" 2678, "taxa" 9228, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14347, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14298, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9390}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007305", :literature {"PUB00009891" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Conchon S" "Cao X" "Barlowe C" "Pelham HR."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/18.14.3934", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Got1p and Sft2p: membrane proteins involved in traffic to the Golgi complex.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "3934-46", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10406798}, "PUB00015208" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6534", "authors" ["Banfield DK" "Lewis MJ" "Pelham HR."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/375806a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A SNARE-like protein required for traffic through the Golgi complex.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "806-9", "volume" "375", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7596416}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016192", "name" "vesicle-mediated transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007305", "name" "Vesicle transport protein, Got1/SFT2-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011691", "name" "Vesicle transport protein SFT2", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045176", "name" "Protein transport protein Got1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 237, "alignment:full" 8571}}}
