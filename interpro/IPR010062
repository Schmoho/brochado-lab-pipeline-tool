{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The N(5),N(10)-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase system of methanogenic archaea is composed of H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd, [interpro:IPR004889]) and F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ([interpro:IPR002844]) [[cite:PUB00014604], [cite:PUB00014605]]. Hmd is an iron-sulphur-cluster-free enzyme that contains an intrinsic CO ligand bound to iron [[cite:PUB00016833]]. The Hmd enzymes can be divide into two distinct subgroups: one has been experimentally characterised as H2-forming N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd or HmdI), and the other one contains isozymes that have not been experimentally characterised (HmdII and HmdIII). Because all three isozyme forms are present in each of the corresponding sequenced genomes, it has been suggested that HmdII and HmdIII may not exhibit Hmd activity and may have a different biological function [[cite:PUB00013473]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the experimentally characterised (HmdI) subgroup of the  N(5),N(10)-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hav", "name" "Crystal structure of [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd) from Methanococcus aeolicus in complex with FeGP and methenyl-tetrahydromethanopterin (close form A) at 1.06 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500165" "H2-forming N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01090" "5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase [hmd]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01723" "5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase", "short" "HMD_"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 105}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0915", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0915"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
