{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) ([ec:2.7.7.48]) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [[cite:PUB00033622], [cite:PUB00033623]]. It catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear.\r\nThe postulated RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA synthesis begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the addition of a nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTP) to the 3'-OH of the first initiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the complementary RNA product [[cite:PUB00033624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The nucleotide sequence for the RNA of Potato leafroll virus (PLrV) has been determined [[cite:PUB00003126], [cite:PUB00001567]]. The sequence contains six large open reading frames (ORFs). The 5' coding region encodes two polypeptides of 28K and 70K, which overlap in different reading frames; it is suggested that the third ORF in the 5' block is translated by frameshift read through near the end of the 70K protein, yielding a 118K polypeptide [[cite:PUB00003126]]. The C-terminal part of the 118K protein contains a consensus sequence for RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases [[cite:PUB00003126]].</p>\r\n<p>The genomic RNA sequence of Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV) has been determined [[cite:PUB00005564]]. The genome contains four ORFs. The largest ORF encodes the two largest proteins translated in cell-free extracts from full-length virion RNA [[cite:PUB00005564]]. Segments of the predicted amino acid sequence of this ORF resemble those of known viral RNA-polymerases, ATP-binding proteins and viral genome-linked proteins [[cite:PUB00005564]].</p>\r\n<p>The genome sequence of Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) RNA 1 shows strong organisational relationships and sequence similarities to the Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) and PLrV [[cite:PUB00003140]]. Sequence analysis reveals five predominant ORFs. The third ORF is characterised by a number of RNA-polymerase motifs and a helicase-like motif typical of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases [[cite:PUB00003140]]. It overlaps (out of frame) the ORF 2 product and is proposed to be expressed by a frameshift fusion of ORF 2 and ORF 3 [[cite:PUB00003140]].</p>\r\n<p>The PLrV sequence shows some similarities to the putative polymerase of SBMV [[cite:PUB00005564]], and more extensive similarities to the corresponding BWYV polypeptide [[cite:PUB00004354]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043502", "name" "DNA/RNA polymerase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042032", "name" "Viral RNA-directed RNA polymerase, 4-helical domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02123" "Viral RNA-directed RNA-polymerase"}, "prints" {"PR00914" "LVIRUSRNAPOL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-directed RNA polymerase, luteovirus", "short" "RNA-dir_pol_luteovirus"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 475, "taxa" 1927, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8741, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7495, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 65}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
