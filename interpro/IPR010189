{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Shikimate kinase ([ec:2.7.1.71]) catalyses the fifth step in the shikimate pathway of aromatic amino acids biosynthesis. It converts shikimate to shikimate 3-phosphate (3-phosphoshikimate). This part of the pathway leads to the biosynthesis of chorismate, the precursor of aromatic amino acids, folates, ubiquinones, and other aromatic compounds. The shikimate pathway links metabolism of carbohydrates to biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and their derivatives in microorganisms and plants [[cite:PUB00014334]]. In a sequence of seven enzymatic reactions, D-erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway and phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), a glycolytic intermediate, are converted to chorismate. The shikimate pathway is present in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants. The absence of the shikimate pathway in animals makes it an attractive target for non-toxic herbicides, antimicrobial and antifungal agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shikimate kinase enzymes present an example of convergent evolution via enzyme recruitment from an unrelated group. This group represents shikimate kinases of the archaeal type. Members have no sequence similarity with the typical form of shikimate kinase ([interpro:IPR000623]) found in bacteria and eukaryotes, but are instead distantly related to homoserine kinases, which belong to the GHMP kinase domain superfamily (GHMP = galactose, homoserine, mevalonate, and phosphomevalonate) [[cite:PUB00013836]]. All known non-archaeal shikimate kinases (the typical form) belong to the non-homologous, structurally unrelated nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase domain superfamily [[cite:PUB00003386]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nomenclature note: the name AroK is used for non-homologous shikimate kinases of both the archaeal and bacterial types.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014721", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5 domain 2-type fold, subgroup", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00370" "Shikimate kinase [aroK]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005758" "Shikimate kinase, archaeal type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01920" "shikimate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shikimate kinase, archaea", "short" "SK_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1642, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1609, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1609, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1405}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"} {"accession" "GenProp1478", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1478"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
