These viruses cause gastroenteritis.  This protein may form a portal-like structure at a unique three-fold axis of symmetry, following binding to the host receptor. The channel formed by VP2 may allow the delivery of the viral genome through the host endosomal membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05752" "Calicivirus minor structural protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Minor structural protein VP2, calicivirus", "short" "Minor_structural_calicivir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 317, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008437", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008437", "name" "Minor structural protein VP2, calicivirus", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 1}}}
