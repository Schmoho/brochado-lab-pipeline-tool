{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylases (UXS, also known as UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase or UDP-XYL synthase) which catalyse the NAD-dependent decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid to form UDP-xylose, a sugar donor required for the synthesis of glycoproteins, polysaccharides, various metabolites, and oligosaccharides in plants, animals, fungi and bacteria [[cite:PUB00057839], [cite:PUB00096336]].
