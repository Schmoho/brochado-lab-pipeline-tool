{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trs65 is a specific subunit of the TRAPP II complex, a highly conserved vesicle tethering complex that functions in the late Golgi as a guanine nucleotide exchanger (GEF) for the Golgi YPT1 GTPase [[cite:PUB00055557], [cite:PUB00056101], [cite:PUB00153720]].</p>\n\n<p>TRAPP subunits are found in three forms-core TRAPP/TRAPPI, TRAPPII, and TRAPPIII [[cite:PUB00153720]] and they function in various vesicle trafficking pathways. TRAPPI mediates transport from endoplasmic reticulum to cis-Golgi by tethering COPII (coat protein complex II)-coated vesicles; TRAPPII interacts with COPI-coated vesicles in mammalian cells and aids in endosome-to-Golgi transport and TRAPPIII plays a unique role in autophagy. A distinct feature of the TRAPP complexes is they act as GEFs and play an essential role in catalysing nucleotide exchange for Ypt/Rab GTPase. The three complexes share a core of six different proteins (Bet3, Bet5, Trs20, Trs23, Trs31, and Trs33) that make up core TRAPPI. TRAPPII contains four additional proteins (Trs120, Trs130, Trs65, and Tca17), and TRAPPIII has one additional Trs85 in yeast [[cite:PUB00153720], [cite:PUB00055565]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28159" "TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX II-SPECIFIC SUBUNIT 65"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trafficking protein particle complex II-specific subunit 65", "short" "Trs65"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1089, "taxa" 2884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1592, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1592, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 995}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024662", :literature {"PUB00055565" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Sacher M" "Kim YG" "Lavie A" "Oh BH" "Segev N."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00833.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "The TRAPP complex: insights into its architecture and function.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "2032-42", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18801063}, "PUB00056101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Liang Y" "Morozova N" "Tokarev AA" "Mulholland JW" "Segev N."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
