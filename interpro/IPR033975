{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ThnP is thought to be responsible for the vitamin B12 dependent methylation of the beta-lactam ring in the thienamycin (thn) gene cluster. It is currently not known what the methyl donor is, but in keeping with the other B12-dependent methyltransferases, it has been shown as methylcobalamin here. Mutagenesis performed on the thnP gene product demonstrated that thnP is essential for thienamycin biosynthesis. However, the mutant retained the ability to produce cephamycin, thus showing that ThnP is not involved in cephamycin C biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00081927]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00402" "carbapenem intermediate methyltransferase (ThnP-like)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbapenem intermediate methyltransferase, ThnP-like", "short" "ThnP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 24, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033975", :literature {"PUB00081927" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Rodriguez M" "Nunez LE" "Brana AF" "Mendez C" "Salas JA" "Blanco G."], "ISO_journal" "Antimicrob.
