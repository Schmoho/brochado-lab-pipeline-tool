ComGC, GD, GE and GG have N-terminal sequence motifs typical of type 4 pre-pilins and are processed by a pathway that requires the product of comC, also an essential competence gene. They form pilin-like structures that are localised to the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall [[cite:PUB00045993]]. The comG operon also consist of ComGF, a small integral membrane protein, ComGA and ComGB, which are predicted to be a nucleotide binding protein and an integral membrane protein respectively [[cite:PUB00067657]]. When strains missing each of the 7 proteins are created, they were all found to be nontransformable and failed to bind transforming DNA to the cell surface [[cite:PUB00045992]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041014" "competence type IV pilus minor pilin ComGG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Competence protein ComGG, Streptococcus-type", "short" "ComGG_streptococcus-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 88, "taxa" 507, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 765, "sets" 0, "proteins" 765, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 600}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047665", :literature {"PUB00045992" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chung YS" "Dubnau D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
