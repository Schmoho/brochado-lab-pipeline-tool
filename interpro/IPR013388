{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein is encoded by genes which are found in type III secretion operons, and has been shown to be essential for the invasion phenotype in Salmonella and a component of the secretion apparatus [[cite:PUB00020770]]. The protein is known as OrgA in Salmonella due to its oxygen-dependent expression pattern in which low-oxygen levels up-regulate the gene [[cite:PUB00020748]]. In Shigella it is called MxiK and has been shown to be essential for the proper assembly of the needle complex, which is the core component of type III secretion systems [[cite:PUB00020740]]. The putative uncharacterized protein YgeO from E. coli is also included in this entry.
