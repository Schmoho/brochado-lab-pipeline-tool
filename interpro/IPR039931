{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes human early estrogen-induced gene proteins 1 and 2 (EEIG1/2), also known as FAM102A and FAM102B, respectively, and some uncharacterised proteins from fungi. EEIG1 was first identified as early estrogen-inducible gene in breast cancer cell lines [[cite:PUB00044243]]. More recently, EEIG1 has been described as a RANK ligand (RANKL)-inducible protein that controls RANK-mediated osteoclast formation, which constitutes a possible therapeutic target for pathological bone destruction [[cite:PUB00103591], [cite:PUB00103590]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21456" "FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 102"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EEIG1/2-like", "short" "EEIG1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2078, "taxa" 6854, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4936, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4936, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3206}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039931", :literature {"PUB00103591" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Choi HK" "Kang HR" "Jung E" "Kim TE" "Lin JJ" "Lee SY."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "Early estrogen-induced gene 1, a novel RANK signaling component, is essential for osteoclastogenesis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "524-36", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23478294}, "PUB00103590" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Jeong E" "Kim J" "Go M" "Lee SY."], "ISO_journal" "FASEB J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FASEB J", "title" "Early estrogen-induced gene 1 facilitates osteoclast formation through the inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 8 expression.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "12894-12906", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32741026}, "PUB00044243" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wang DY" "Fulthorpe R" "Liss SN" "Edwards EA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
