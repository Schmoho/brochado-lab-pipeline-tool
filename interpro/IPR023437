{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Argininosuccinate synthase ([ec:6.3.4.5]) (AS) is a urea cycle enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in arginine biosynthesis: the ATP-dependent ligation of citrulline to aspartate to form argininosuccinate, AMP and pyrophosphate [[cite:PUB00001799], [cite:PUB00002066]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, a defect in the AS gene causes citrullinemia, a genetic disease characterised by severe vomiting spells and mental retardation.</p>\n\n<p>AS is a homotetrameric enzyme of chains of about 400 amino-acid residues.
