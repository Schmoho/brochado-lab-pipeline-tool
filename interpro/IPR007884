{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains protein-histidine N-methyltransferases (also known as DORA reverse strand protein DREV) that specifically catalyse 1-methylhistidine (pros-methylhistidine) methylation of target proteins, such as S100A9, NDUFB3, SLC39A5, SLC39A7, ARMC6 and DNAJB12 [[cite:PUB00010151], [cite:PUB00097903]]. They mediate methylation of proteins with a His-x-His (HxH) motif (where 'x' is preferably a small amino acid), in which the 1-methylhistidine modification may affect the binding of zinc and other metals [[cite:PUB00097903]]. These proteins constitute the main methyltransferase for the 1-methylhistidine modification in cell [[cite:PUB00097903]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7yf2", "name" "Crystal structure of METTL9 in complex with unmethylated SLC39A5 peptide and SAH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12890" "DREV PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF05219" "DREV methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein-L-histidine N-pros-methyltransferase", "short" "METL9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 53, "proteomes" 1060, "taxa" 4269, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2123, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2058, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1439}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
