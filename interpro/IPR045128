{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PI31 is a regulatory subunit of the immunoproteasome which is an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome in vitro. PI31 is also an Fbxo7.Skp1 binding partner. Fbxo7 is an F-box protein, which are the substrate-recognition components of the Skp1-Cul1-F box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases. The interaction between PI31 and Fbxo7.Skp1 occurs via the β sheets of a N-terminal domain present in both proteins and known as FP(Fbxo7/PI31) domain. The structure of PI31 FP domain contains a novel α/β-fold and two intermolecular contact surfaces [[cite:PUB00049891]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ouh", "name" "Crystal structure of the FP domain of Human PI31 Proteasome Inhibitor"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13266" "PROTEASOME INHIBITOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasome inhibitor PI31-like", "short" "PI31-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2254, "taxa" 7684, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3921, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3921, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2540}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045128", :literature {"PUB00049891" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Kirk R" "Laman H" "Knowles PP" "Murray-Rust J" "Lomonosov M" "Meziane el K" "McDonald NQ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
