{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of WD repeat-containing proteins, including DCAF7 from animals, LWD1/2/TTG1 from Arabidopsis and YPL247C from budding yeasts. In general, WD40 repeat domain-containing proteins are scaffolding elements for the assembly of multi-subunit protein complexes. DCAF7, also known as WDR68, interacts with Dual-specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A, a Down's syndrome-associated protein kinase) [[cite:PUB00098167]] and is required for Endothelin-1 (EDN1) signalling [[cite:PUB00098166]]. It also acts as a DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor [[cite:PUB00067700]]. Mutations in the DCAF7 gene have been linked to cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) [[cite:PUB00098169]]. In Arabidopsis, LWD1 and LWD2 serve as clock proteins involved in photoperiod flowering control [[cite:PUB00098168]]. TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 1 (TTG1) is a regulator of early developmental traits and is also involved in flowering time regulation [[cite:PUB00098165]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19919" "WD REPEAT CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein DCAF7-like", "short" "DCAF7-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2547, "taxa" 8932, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5376, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5376, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3518}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045159", :literature {"PUB00098165" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Paffendorf BAM" "Qassrawi R" "Meys AM" "Trimborn L" "Schrader A."], "ISO_journal" "PeerJ", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PeerJ", "title" "TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 1 participates in flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "e8303", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31998554}, "PUB00098166" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Nissen RM" "Amsterdam A" "Hopkins N."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Dev Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Dev Biol", "title" "A zebrafish screen for craniofacial mutants identifies wdr68 as a highly conserved gene required for endothelin-1 expression.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "28", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16759393}, "PUB00098167" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Park J" "Chung KC."], "ISO_journal" "Exp Neurobiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Exp Neurobiol", "title" "New Perspectives of Dyrk1A Role in Neurogenesis and Neuropathologic Features of Down Syndrome.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "244-8", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24465139}, "PUB00098168" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wu JF" "Wang Y" "Wu SH."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Two new clock proteins, LWD1 and LWD2, regulate Arabidopsis photoperiodic flowering.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "948-59", "volume" "148", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18676661}, "PUB00098169" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Leslie EJ" "Carlson JC" "Shaffer JR" "Feingold E" "Wehby G" "Laurie CA" "Jain D" "Laurie CC" "Doheny KF" "McHenry T" "Resick J" "Sanchez C" "Jacobs J" "Emanuele B" "Vieira AR" "Neiswanger K" "Lidral AC" "Valencia-Ramirez LC" "Lopez-Palacio AM" "Valencia DR" "Arcos-Burgos M" "Czeizel AE" "Field LL" "Padilla CD" "Cutiongco-de la Paz EM" "Deleyiannis F" "Christensen K" "Munger RG" "Lie RT" "Wilcox A" "Romitti PA" "Castilla EE" "Mereb JC" "Poletta FA" "Orioli IM" "Carvalho FM" "Hecht JT" "Blanton SH" "Buxo CJ" "Butali A" "Mossey PA" "Adeyemo WL" "James O" "Braimah RO" "Aregbesola BS" "Eshete MA" "Abate F" "Koruyucu M" "Seymen F" "Ma L" "de Salamanca JE" "Weinberg SM" "Moreno L" "Murray JC" "Marazita ML."], "ISO_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "title" "A multi-ethnic genome-wide association study identifies novel loci for non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate on 2p24.2, 17q23 and 19q13.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "2862-2872", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27033726}, "PUB00067700" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Jin J" "Arias EE" "Chen J" "Harper JW" "Walter JC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
