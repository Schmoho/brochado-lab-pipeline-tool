{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a structurally complex cofactor, consisting of a modified tetrapyrrole with a centrally chelated cobalt. Cobalamin is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: methylcobalamin and adocobalamin. Most prokaryotes, as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes, whereas plants and fungi do not appear to use it. In bacteria and archaea, these include methionine synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, glutamate and methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, ethanolamine ammonia lyase, and diol dehydratase [[cite:PUB00015657]]. In mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [[cite:PUB00035308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents CobF precorrin-6A synthase ([ec:2.1.1.152]), a pathway-specific enzyme in the aerobic pathway. After precorrin-4 is methylated at C-11 by CobM to produce precorrin-5, the extruded acyl group is then removed in the subsequent step, which also sees a methyl group added at C-1 in a reaction catalysed by CobF. The product of this reaction is precorrin-6A, which is subsequently reduced by an NADH-dependent reductase to precorrin-6B [[cite:PUB00009744]].
