{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated protein (HILPDA), also known as hypoxia-inducible protein 2 (HIG2), increases intracellular lipid accumulation. It stimulates expression of cytokines including IL6, MIF and VEGFA. It also enhances cell growth and proliferation [[cite:PUB00060183], [cite:PUB00060184]]. Human HILPDA is highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma cells but barely detectable in adjacent normal kidney tissue.
