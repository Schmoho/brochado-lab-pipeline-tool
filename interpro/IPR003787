{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Four small, soluble proteins (DsrE, DsrF, DsrH and DsrC) are encoded in the dsr gene region of the phototrophic sulphur bacterium Chromatium vinosum D. The dsrAB genes encoding dissimilatory sulphite reductase are part of the gene cluster, dsrABEFHCMK. The remaining proteins that are encoded are a transmembrane protein (DsrM) with similarity to haem-b-binding polypeptides and a soluble protein (DsrK) resembling [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing heterodisulphide reductase from methanogenic archaea. DsrE is a small soluble protein involved in intracellular sulphur reduction [[cite:PUB00008255]]. In E. coli, the DsrEFH homologue TusBCD interacts with the DsrC homologue TusE in a sulfur relay system during 2-thiouridine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00043028]].</p>\n\n<p>This family includes DsrE/F and the homologues TusD/C.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hy5", "name" "Crystal structure of DsrEFH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027396", "name" "DsrEFH-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02635" "DsrE/DsrF-like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphur relay, DsrE/F-like", "short" "Sulphur_relay_DsrE/F-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 4159, "taxa" 19100, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34712, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34693, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27017}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
