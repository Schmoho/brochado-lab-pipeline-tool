{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, also known as phosphoriboisomerase, catalyses the reversible conversion of D-ribose 5-phosphate to D-ribulose 5-phosphate, the first step in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway [[cite:PUB00028856]]. This reaction enables ribose to be synthesized from sugars, as well as the recycling of sugars during the degradation of nucleotides. There are two unrelated types of ribose 5-phosphate isomerases: type A (RpiA) is the most common and is found in most organisms, while type B (RpiB) is restricted to specific eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. Escherichia coli produces both RpiA and RpiB (also known as AlsB), although RpiA accounts for 99% of total RPI enzymes [[cite:PUB00020248]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of type A ribose-5-phosphate isomerase that is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (plants and Metazoa), but excluding those found in fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1m0s", "name" "NORTHEAST STRUCTURAL GENOMICS CONSORTIUM (NESG ID IR21)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037171", "name" "NagB/RpiA transferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00170" "Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A [rpiA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, type A, subgroup", "short" "Ribose5P_isomerase_typA_subgr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5113, "taxa" 22537, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22052, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22047, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16867}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
