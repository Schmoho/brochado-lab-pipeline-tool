{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cyclin-dependent kinase 2-interacting protein (CINP) is a component of the active cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes [[cite:PUB00054095]]. It is phopshorylated by Cdc7, but not by Cdk2 [[cite:PUB00054095]]. CINP has also been shown to bind to chromatin in a replication-dependent manner, and to associate with Origin Recognition Complex-2 (ORC2)-containing complexes and minichromosome maintenance/DNA replication licensing complex, MCM [[cite:PUB00054095]]. It has been proposed that CINP is part of the Cdc7-dependent mechanism of origin firing, and constitutes a physical link between Cdk2 and Cdc7 complexes at the origins [[cite:PUB00054095]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8cih", "name" "Structure of FL CINP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02040" "Cyclin-dependent kinase 2-interacting protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase 2-interacting protein", "short" "Cyclin-dep_Kinase_2_interact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 732, "taxa" 2792, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7255, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1203, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 796}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023250", :literature {"PUB00054095" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Grishina I" "Lattes B."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Cycle", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Cycle", "title" "A novel Cdk2 interactor is phosphorylated by Cdc7 and associates with components of the replication complexes.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1120-6", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16082200}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023250", "name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase 2-interacting protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
