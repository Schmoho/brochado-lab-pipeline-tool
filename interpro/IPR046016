{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). This BGC (BGC0001577) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic class, RiPP (ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptide). It includes lantibiotic duramycin, duramycin B and cinnamycin. Duramycin B is a potent inhibitor of human phospholipase A2. It exhibits only a weak antibacterial activity against B.subtilis, and does not display antimicrobial activity against S.aureus, S.mitis, E.coli, K.pneumoniae, P.vulgaris and C.albicans [[cite:PUB00151902]]</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6c0h", "name" "Lysinoalanine synthase, DurN, from duramycin biosynthesis bound to 1-Dha6Ala"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19398" "Lantibiotic duramycin B-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lantibiotic duramycin/duramycin B-like", "short" "Dur/DurB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 129, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 61, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046016", :literature {"PUB00151902" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Fredenhagen A" "Fendrich G" "Marki F" "Marki W" "Gruner J" "Raschdorf F" "Peter HH."], "ISO_journal" "J Antibiot (Tokyo)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7164/antibiotics.43.1403", "medline_journal" "J Antibiot (Tokyo)", "title" "Duramycins B and C, two new lanthionine containing antibiotics as inhibitors of phospholipase A2.
