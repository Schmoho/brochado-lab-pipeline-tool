{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>L-fuculose phosphate aldolase converts L-fuculose 1-phosphate to glycerone phosphate + (S)-lactaldehyde. The structure of the class II zinc-ion dependent L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase from Escherichia coli has been established at 1.92 A resolution. The homo-tetrameric enzyme has a molecular mass of 4 x 24kDa and follows C(4) symmetry. The four catalytic centres are located in deep clefts at the interfaces of adjacent subunits. The zinc ion is coordinated by three histidines and one glutamate in an almost tetrahedral arrangement. In contrast to numerous other catalytically competent zinc ions, there is no water molecule in the ligand sphere. Sequence homology searches revealed a significant similarity to the bacterial L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase, [interpro:IPR004661] [[cite:PUB00015579]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate/5-deoxyribulose-1-phosphate aldolase which uses 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate or 5-deoxyribulose-1-phosphate to produce acetaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, with 10-fold greater catalytic efficiency compared to FucA. This enzyme participates in the bifunctional DHAP-shunt salvage pathway for SAM by-products [[cite:PUB00094224]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1e4c", "name" "L-Fuculose 1-Phosphate Aldolase from Escherichia coli Mutant S71Q"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036409", "name" "Class II aldolase/adducin N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01086" "L-fuculose-phosphate aldolase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00987" "L-fuculose phosphate aldolase [fucA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-fucose phosphate aldolase", "short" "FucA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 736, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 839, "sets" 0, "proteins" 839, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 689}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1680", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1680"} {"accession" "GenProp0458", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0458"} {"accession" "GenProp1529", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1529"} {"accession" "GenProp1589", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1589"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
