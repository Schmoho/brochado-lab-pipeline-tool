{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GapR is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) critical for cellular function in Caulobacter crescentus (also known as Caulobacter vibrioides). Loss of GapR causes severe defects in growth, cell division, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation [[cite:PUB00100154], [cite:PUB00100155]]. This is a DNA-binding protein which has mainly an α-helical secondary structure. In the absence of DNA, GapR is a dimer, with each monomer folded into two extended α-helices, while in the presence of DNA, GapR forms a tetramer, with the C-terminal α-helix of each monomer reorganised into two shorter helices, which allows GapR to encircle the DNA [[cite:PUB00100155]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents GapR-like from Caulobacter and similar proteins predominantly found in Alphaproteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6cfx", "name" "Bosea sp GapR solved in the presence of DNA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00797" "UPF0335 protein <locus_tag>"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GapR-like", "short" "GapR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 888, "taxa" 3270, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3315, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3315, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2615}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018753", :literature {"PUB00100154" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Arias-Cartin R" "Dobihal GS" "Campos M" "Surovtsev IV" "Parry B" "Jacobs-Wagner C."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Replication fork passage drives asymmetric dynamics of a critical nucleoid-associated protein in Caulobacter.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "301-318", "volume" "36", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28011580}, "PUB00100155" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tarry MJ" "Harmel C" "Taylor JA" "Marczynski GT" "Schmeing TM."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Structures of GapR reveal a central channel which could accommodate B-DNA.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "16679", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31723182}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018753", "name" "GapR-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
