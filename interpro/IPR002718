{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes constitute a semi-permeable, size-dependent permeability barrier, for example to hydrolytic enzymes, detergents, dyes and hydrophobic anti-microbials. The outer membrane protein (OMP) profile of Helicobacter pylori differs from that of other Gram-negative bacteria, where the highly non-selective porins are absent and a number of less abundant protein species are observed [[cite:PUB00005795]]. OMPs from H. pylori have been identified as porins, gastric epithelial cell adhesins and Lewis B binding adhesins [[cite:PUB00011285]]. Extensive C-terminal sequence similarity between these OMPs has been used to define a much larger paralogous family.</p>\n\n<p>H. pylori is the causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulceration in humans. Numerous subtypes of OMPs have also been identified. Attempts have been made to construct recombinant vectors that are able to express these OMPs in order to develop a vaccine protecting against Hp infection and a diagnostic reagent kit to quickly detect infection. OMPs were chosen as possible targets of vaccine development as they are H. pylori specific, surface exposed and highly antigenic.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01856" "Helicobacter outer membrane protein"}, "prints" {"PR01776" "HPOMPFAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Outer membrane protein, Helicobacter", "short" "OMP_Helicobacter"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8420, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7319, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6258}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002718", :literature {"PUB00005795" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6642", "authors" ["Tomb JF" "White O" "Kerlavage AR" "Clayton RA" "Sutton GG" "Fleischmann RD" "Ketchum KA" "Klenk HP" "Gill S" "Dougherty BA" "Nelson K" "Quackenbush J" "Zhou L" "Kirkness EF" "Peterson S" "Loftus B" "Richardson D" "Dodson R" "Khalak HG" "Glodek A" "McKenney K" "Fitzegerald LM" "Lee N" "Adams MD" "Hickey EK" "Berg DE" "Gocayne JD" "Utterback TR" "Peterson JD" "Kelley JM" "Cotton MD" "Weidman JM" "Fujii C" "Bowman C" "Watthey L" "Wallin E" "Hayes WS" "Borodovsky M" "Karp PD" "Smith HO" "Fraser CM" "Venter JC."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/41483", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "The complete genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "539-47", "volume" "388", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9252185}, "PUB00011285" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5349", "authors" ["Ilver D" "Arnqvist A" "Ogren J" "Frick IM" "Kersulyte D" "Incecik ET" "Berg DE" "Covacci A" "Engstrand L" "Boren T."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.279.5349.373", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Helicobacter pylori adhesin binding fucosylated histo-blood group antigens revealed by retagging.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "373-7", "volume" "279", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9430586}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002718", "name" "Outer membrane protein, Helicobacter", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 274}}}
