{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Melanocyte protein PMEL (also known as PMEL-17), Transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) and Transmembrane protein 130, previously described as melanocyte protein PMEL-17-related family. Regarding the highly conserved domain architecture of these family members,  including the PKD, KLD and transmembrane (TM) domains, the name was updated and now referred to as PKD- and KLD-Associated Transmembrane (PKAT) protein family [[cite:PUB00100704]].
