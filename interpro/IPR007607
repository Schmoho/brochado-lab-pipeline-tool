{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of bactofilins, a functionally diverse class of cytoskeletal, polymer-forming, proteins that is widely conserved among bacteria, such as BacP, BacN and BacO from Myxococcus xanthus, which are non-essential components of the chromosome segregation machinery [[cite:PUB00153757]].\nThese proteins position the ParA-ParB-parS chromosome segregation machinery within the cell; BacP seems to be the most important bactofilin in this process [[cite:PUB00153757]]. They form a heteropolymeric, subpolar scaffold in the cell in which BacP probably forms the core, BacO contributes to position and integrity while BacN does not seem to contribute to assembly [[cite:PUB00153757]]. In C. crescentus, two bactofilins assemble into a membrane-associated laminar structure that shows cell-cycle-dependent polar localisation and acts as a platform for the recruitment of a cell wall biosynthetic enzyme involved in polar morphogenesis. Bactofilins display distinct subcellular distributions and dynamics in different bacterial species, suggesting that they are versatile structural elements that have adopted a range of different cellular functions [[cite:PUB00086465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35024" "HYPOTHETICAL CYTOSOLIC PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF04519" "Polymer-forming cytoskeletal"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bactofilin A/B", "short" "BacA/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 113, "proteomes" 3883, "taxa" 16284, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27593, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20516}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007607", :literature {"PUB00153757" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lin L" "Osorio Valeriano M" "Harms A" "Sogaard-Andersen L" "Thanbichler M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02015-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Bactofilin-mediated organization of the ParABS chromosome segregation system in Myxococcus xanthus.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1817", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29180656}, "PUB00086465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kuhn J" "Briegel A" "Morschel E" "Kahnt J" "Leser K" "Wick S" "Jensen GJ" "Thanbichler M."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2009.358", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Bactofilins, a ubiquitous class of cytoskeletal proteins mediating polar localization of a cell wall synthase in Caulobacter crescentus.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "327-39", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19959992}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007607", "name" "Bactofilin A/B", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 358, "alignment:full" 5468}}}
