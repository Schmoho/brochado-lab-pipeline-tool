{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins included in this entry are conserved from plants and fungi to humans. Erv46 (ERGIC3) works in close conjunction with Erv41 (ERGIC2) and together they form a complex which cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Erv46-41 interacts strongly with the endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase II. Mammalian glucosidase II comprises a catalytic alpha-subunit and a 58kDa beta subunit, which is required for ER localisation. All proteins identified biochemically as Erv41p-Erv46p interactors are localised to the early secretory pathway and are involved in protein maturation and processing in the ER and/or sorting into COPII vesicles for transport to the Golgi [[cite:PUB00063190]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes disulfide isomerase (PDI)-C subfamily members from Arabidopsis.
