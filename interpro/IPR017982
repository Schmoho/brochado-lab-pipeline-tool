{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Insect defensins are a diverse family of anti-bacterial peptides, largely active against Gram-positive bacteria [[cite:PUB00004678], [cite:PUB00002559], [cite:PUB00000525], [cite:PUB00002677], [cite:PUB00001431]]. All these peptides range in length from 38 to 51 amino acids. There are six conserved cysteines all involved in intrachain disulphide bonds.</p>\n\n<p>A schematic representation of peptides from the arthropod defensin family is shown below.</p>\n\n<pre>\n        +----------------------------+\n        |                   | \n       xxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxCxxxCxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxCxCxx\n                  |  |          | |\n                  +---|---------------+ |\n                     +-----------------+\n\n'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulphide bond.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Although low level sequence similarities have been reported [[cite:PUB00004678]] between the insect defensins and mammalian defensins, the topological arrangement of the disulphide bonds as well as the tertiary structure [[cite:PUB00001593]] are completely different in the two families.</p>\n\n<p>A member of this family, coprisin, is a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial peptide against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00097948], [cite:PUB00097946]], also active against all antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains tested [[cite:PUB00097946]], which acts through the permeabilization of the bacterial cell membrane [[cite:PUB00097946]]. It can induce apoptosis in C.albicans, without disrupting the fungal plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00097947]]. This defensin also shows potent anti-inflammatory activities, since it reduces both LPS-induced nitric oxide release and proinflammatory cytokine production [[cite:PUB00097946]]. The anti-inflammatory activities are initiated by suppressing the binding of LPS to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and subsequently inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear translocation of NF-kB (TNFRSF11A) [[cite:PUB00097946]]. This defensin is an interesting antibacterial compound that does not show hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and does not affect human cell membranes [[cite:PUB00097946]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036574", "name" "Knottin, scorpion toxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00271" "DEFENSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Defensin, insect", "short" "Defensin_insect"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 284, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 164, "sets" 0, "proteins" 122, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 104}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017982", :literature {"PUB00097946" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lee E" "Kim JK" "Shin S" "Jeong KW" "Shin A" "Lee J" "Lee DG" "Hwang JS" "Kim Y."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta", "title" "Insight into the antimicrobial activities of coprisin isolated from the dung beetle, Copris tripartitus, revealed by structure-activity relationships.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "271-83", "volume" "1828", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23137439}, "PUB00000525" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yamada K" "Natori S."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
