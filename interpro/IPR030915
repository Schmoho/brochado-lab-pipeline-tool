{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Spore formation by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a stress response triggered by nutrient limitation. Two operons are strongly induced at the start of sporulation; one of them is skf (for sporulation killing factor). skf produces a killing factor which, together with a signaling protein, act cooperatively to block sister cells from sporulating and cause them to lyse, providing a source of nutrients to support the sporulation process [[cite:PUB00055033]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first gene of the skf operon, skfA, encodes a small peptide. SkfA induces the lysis of sibling cells that have not entered the sporulation pathway [[cite:PUB00074206]]. The product of the second gene, skfB, encodes a radical SAM enzyme. SkfB creates a sactipeptide (sulfur-to-Î±-carbon) crosslink of Cys-4 to Met-12 of the mature form of SkfA. In Paenibacillus larvae subsp larvae B-3650, the Met is replaced by Leu, so the modification must be different. SkfB has 2 4Fe-4S clusters, one in its radical SAM domain ([interpro:IPR007197]) and one in a region that somewhat resembles the SPASM domain ([interpro:IPR023885]) [[cite:PUB00074204]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6efn", "name" "Structure of a RiPP maturase, SkfB"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00515" "sporulation killing factor protein (SkfB-like)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04403" "sporulation killing factor system radical SAM maturase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation killing factor system, radical SAM maturase SkfB", "short" "rSAM_SkfB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 44, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1078", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1078"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
