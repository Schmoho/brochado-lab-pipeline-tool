{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This subfamily includes solute carrier family 17 member 9 (SLC17A9) and similar proteins including plant inorganic phosphate transporters (PHT4) that are also probably anion transporters. SLC17A9, also called voltage-gated purine nucleotide uniporter SLC17A9 and vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), is involved in vesicular storage and exocytosis of ATP. It facilitates the accumulation of ATP and other nucleotides in secretory vesicles such as adrenal chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles [[cite:PUB00097062], [cite:PUB00141996]]. It also functions as a lysosomal ATP transporter and regulates cell viability [[cite:PUB00097064]]. By controlling ATP storage in lysosomes, it regulates ATP-dependent proteins of these organelles [[cite:PUB00151141]]. Plant PHT4 family transporters mediate the transport of inorganic phosphate and may also transport organic anions. The Arabidopsis protein AtPHT4;4 is a chloroplast-localized ascorbate transporter [[cite:PUB00097063]]. PHT4 proteins show differential expression that suggests specialized functions [[cite:PUB00097065]].</p>\n\n<p>The SLC17A9-like subfamily belongs to the Solute carrier 17 (SLC17) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement [[cite:PUB00096970]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17380" "Solute carrier family 17 member 9 and similar proteins of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Solute carrier family 17 member 9-like", "short" "SLC17A9-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 923, "taxa" 4070, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4363, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4362, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2569}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044777", :literature {"PUB00141996" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Sesma JI" "Kreda SM" "Okada SF" "van Heusden C" "Moussa L" "Jones LC" "O'Neal WK" "Togawa N" "Hiasa M" "Moriyama Y" "Lazarowski ER."], "ISO_journal" "Am J Physiol Cell Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Am J Physiol Cell Physiol", "title" "Vesicular nucleotide transporter regulates the nucleotide content in airway epithelial mucin granules.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "C976-84", "volume" "304", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23467297}, "PUB00151141" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Huang P" "Cao Q" "Xu M" "Dong XP."], "ISO_journal" "Cells", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cells", "title" "Lysosomal ATP Transporter SLC17A9 Controls Cell Viability via Regulating Cathepsin D.
