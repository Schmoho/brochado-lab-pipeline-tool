{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes lantibiotic ABC transporter permease subunit MutG which is a highly hydrophobic, integral membrane protein, and part of the bacitracin ABC transport system that confers resistance to the Gram-positive bacteria in which this system operates, specifically to lantibiotic mutacin. This protein transports mutacin to the surface and expels it from the membrane. Lantibiotics are small peptides, produced by Gram-positive bacteria, which are ribosomally-synthesized as pre-peptides and act by disrupting membrane integrity. Genes encoding the lantibiotic ABC transporter subunits are highly organized in operons containing all the genes required for maturation, transport, immunity, and synthesis [[cite:PUB00102212], [cite:PUB00102214], [cite:PUB00102213]]. This protein family is largely restricted to gallidermin-family lantibiotic cassettes, but also include orphan transporter cassettes in species that lack candidate lantibiotic precursor and synthetase genes [[cite:PUB00102213], [cite:PUB00102214]]. Members of this group of proteins are predominantly found in Firmicutes and some species of Actinobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21808" "lantibiotic immunity ABC transporter MutG family permease (also called ABC-2 transporter MutG family permease) subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03733" "lantibiotic immunity ABC transporter MutG family permease subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lantibiotic protection ABC transporter permease subunit, MutG family", "short" "ABC-transptr_permeasesu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 254, "taxa" 1105, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1064, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1064, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 867}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0853", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0853"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022294", :literature {"PUB00102214" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Otto M" "Peschel A" "Gotz F."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "title" "Producer self-protection against the lantibiotic epidermin by the ABC transporter EpiFEG of Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu3298.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "203-11", "volume" "166", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9770275}, "PUB00102212" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chen P" "Qi F" "Novak J" "Caufield PW."], "ISO_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Appl Environ Microbiol", "title" "The specific genes for lantibiotic mutacin II biosynthesis in Streptococcus mutans T8 are clustered and can be transferred en bloc.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1356-60", "volume" "65", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10049909}, "PUB00102213" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["McBride SM" "Sonenshein AL."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "Identification of a genetic locus responsible for antimicrobial peptide resistance in Clostridium difficile.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "167-76", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20974818}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022294", "name" "Lantibiotic protection ABC transporter permease subunit, MutG family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
