{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of basic leucine zipper (bZIP)  transcription factors, including Hac1 from yeasts and HY5/HY5-like from Arabidopsis. Hac1 regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) induced by abnormal accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00095722], [cite:PUB00095719], [cite:PUB00095721], [cite:PUB00101867]]. HY5 promotes photomorphogenesis in light [[cite:PUB00095718], [cite:PUB00101866]]. HY5-like protein, also known as HYH, is involved in blue-light regulation of development and gene expression. HYH and HY5 can, respectively, act as heterodimers and homodimers, thus mediating light-regulated expression of overlapping as well as distinct target genes [[cite:PUB00033434]]. It recruits the histone deacetylase HDA15 to the promoters of a subset of cell wall organization and auxin signaling-related genes [[cite:PUB00101866]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2oqq", "name" "Crystal structure of HY5 leucine zipper homodimer from Arabidopsis thaliana"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46714" "TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR HAC1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional activator Hac1/HY5", "short" "Hac1/HY5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1172, "taxa" 3634, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2606, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1588}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044280", :literature {"PUB00101866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Zhao L" "Peng T" "Chen CY" "Ji R" "Gu D" "Li T" "Zhang D" "Tu YT" "Wu K" "Liu X."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "HY5 Interacts with the Histone Deacetylase HDA15 to Repress Hypocotyl Cell Elongation in Photomorphogenesis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1450-1466", "volume" "180", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31061103}, "PUB00101867" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Richie DL" "Feng X" "Hartl L" "Aimanianda V" "Krishnan K" "Powers-Fletcher MV" "Watson DS" "Galande AK" "White SM" "Willett T" "Latge JP" "Rhodes JC" "Askew DS."], "ISO_journal" "Virulence", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virulence", "title" "The virulence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus requires cooperation between the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) and the unfolded protein response (UPR).", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "12-21", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21217201}, "PUB00095718" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zhang H" "Zhao X" "Li J" "Cai H" "Deng XW" "Li L."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "MicroRNA408 is critical for the HY5-SPL7 gene network that mediates the coordinated response to light and copper.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "4933-53", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25516599}, "PUB00095719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kaufman RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Stress signaling from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum: coordination of gene transcriptional and translational controls.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1211-33", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10346810}, "PUB00033434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Holm M" "Ma LG" "Qu LJ" "Deng XW."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.969702", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Two interacting bZIP proteins are direct targets of COP1-mediated control of light-dependent gene expression in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1247-59", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12023303}, "PUB00095721" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Sathe L" "Bolinger C" "Mannan MA" "Dever TE" "Dey M."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Evidence That Base-pairing Interaction between Intron and mRNA Leader Sequences Inhibits Initiation of HAC1 mRNA Translation in Yeast.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "21821-32", "volume" "290", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26175153}, "PUB00095722" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Xia X."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Translation Control of HAC1 by Regulation of Splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31212749}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000981", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045944", "name" "positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044280", "name" "Transcriptional activator Hac1/HY5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
