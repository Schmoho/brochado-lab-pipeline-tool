{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins mainly from Thermodesulfobacteriota, including DVU0259 from Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris ([swissprot:Q72FF5], also known as DivK), a response regulator receiver domain protein apparently with no DNA-binding domain. The architecture suggests that DivK acts through protein-protein interaction rather than DNA-binding. DivK is found only in sulfate-reducing bacteria, and generally is found next to the operon that the hexadecaheme cytochrome HmcA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045717" "DVU0259 family response regulator domain-containing protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DVU0259-like", "short" "DVU0259-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 239, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 208, "sets" 0, "proteins" 208, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 172}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054815", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR050595", "name" "Bacterial response regulator", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR054815", "name" "DVU0259-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
