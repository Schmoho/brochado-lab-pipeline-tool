{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Histidine Triad (HIT) motif, His-x-His-x-His-x-x (x, a\nhydrophobic amino acid) was identified as being highly conserved in a variety of organisms [[cite:PUB00001122], [cite:PUB00005228]]. On the basis of sequence, substrate specificity, structure, evolution and mechanism, HIT proteins are classified into three branches: the Hint branch, which consists of adenosine 5' -monophosphoramide hydrolases, the FHIT branch, that consists of diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolases, and the GalT branch consisting of specific nucloside monophosphate transferases [[cite:PUB00008005], [cite:PUB00003940]].</p>\n\n<p>In budding yeast Hnt1 has been shown to have adenosine monophosphoramidase activity and function as positive regulators of Cdk7/Kin28 in vivo [[cite:PUB00008002], [cite:PUB00099578]]. FHIT plays a very important role in the development of tumours. In fact, FHIT deletions are among the earliest and most frequent genetic alterations in the development of tumours [[cite:PUB00015781], [cite:PUB00089564]]. The third branch of the HIT superfamily, which includes GalT homologues, contains a related His-X-His-X-Gln motif and transfers nucleoside monophosphate moieties to phosphorylated second substrates rather\nthan hydrolysing them [[cite:PUB00008005]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6yqm", "name" "Human histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (hHINT1) complexed with dGMP and refined to 1.02 A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036265", "name" "HIT-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46648" "HIT FAMILY PROTEIN 1", "PTHR23089" "HISTIDINE TRIAD HIT PROTEIN"}, "prints" {"PR00332" "HISTRIAD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine triad (HIT) protein", "short" "Histidine_triad_HIT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 97, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12036, "taxa" 46843, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 73293, "sets" 0, "proteins" 66464, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 49791}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00694", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00694"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
