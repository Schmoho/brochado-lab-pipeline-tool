{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its related factors neurturin (NTN), artemin (ART) and persephin (PSP), are members of the GDNF family of neurotrophic factors. They form a sub-group in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. These factors are involved in the promotion of neurone survival, exerting their effects through specific receptors.</p>\n\n<p>The GDNF family receptors (GFRs) are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked, cell surface receptors [[cite:PUB00009432]]. Four receptor subtypes, termed GFRalpha-1 to 4, are currently recognised. Homologues for the GFRalpha-1 receptor subtype have been cloned from mammalian and avian tissue. The receptor is activated by GDNF [[cite:PUB00011699]], although there is evidence it can also bind neurturin, the principal ligand for GFRalpha-2 [[cite:PUB00009433]].</p>\n\n<p>Activation of GFRalpha-1 triggers its interaction with the membrane-bound receptor kinase Ret. This induces Ret homo-dimerisation, triggering a cascade of intracellular signalling events such as the activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma) dependent pathways [[cite:PUB00009432]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01317" "GDNFRALPHA1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor, alpha 1", "short" "GDNF_rcpt_A1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 447, "taxa" 1559, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2280, "sets" 0, "proteins" 772, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 537}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003503", :literature {"PUB00011699" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2/3", "authors" ["Mason I I."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
