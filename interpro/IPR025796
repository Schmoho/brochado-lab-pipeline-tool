{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SETDB1 is a member of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase Suvar3-9 subfamily. Members of this subfamily trimethylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting HP1 (CBX1, CBX3 and/or CBX5) proteins to methylated histones [[cite:PUB00058086]]. This enzyme mainly functions in euchromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the silencing of euchromatic genes. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation is coordinated with DNA methylation. It probably forms a complex with MBD1 and ATF7IP that represses transcription and couples DNA methylation and histone 'Lys-9' trimethylation [[cite:PUB00058087]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (EC [ec:2.1.1.-]) constitute an important class of enzymes present in every life form. They transfer a methyl group most frequently from S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as oxygen leading to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and a methylated molecule [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]]. All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]]. The substrates that are methylated by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small molecules, to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00006319]]. Methyltransferase are therefore involved in many essential cellular processes including biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]].
