{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N(5)-(carboxyethyl)ornithine synthase (CEOS) catalyses the NADP-dependent conversion of N5-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine to L-ornithine pyruvate. CEOS is related to the NAD-dependent L-alanine dehydrogenases [[cite:PUB00101435]]. Like formate dehydrogenase and related enzymes, CEOS is comprised of 2 domains connected by a long Î±-helical stretch, each resembling a Rossmann fold NAD-binding domain. The NAD-binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the more divergent catalytic domain. These proteins have a partially conserved NAD-binding motif and active site residues that are characteristic of related enzymes such as saccharopine dehydrogenase.
