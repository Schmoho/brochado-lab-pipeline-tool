{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family describes the well-studied thioredoxin-dependent arsenate reductase of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 and other mechanistically similar arsenate reductases. The mechanism involves an intramolecular disulphide bond cascade, and aligned members of this family have four absolutely conserved Cys residues. This group of arsenate reductases belongs to the low-molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase family, as does a group of glutathione/glutaredoxin type arsenate reductases ([interpro:IPR014062]). At least two other, non-homologous groups of arsenate reductases involved in arsenical resistance are also known. This enzyme reduces arsenate to arsenite, which may be more toxic but which is more easily exported [[cite:PUB00027047]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jf8", "name" "X-ray structure of reduced C10S, C15A arsenate reductase from pI258"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036196", "name" "Phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase I superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01624" "Arsenate reductase [arsC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02691" "arsenate reductase (thioredoxin)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenate reductase ArsC", "short" "Arsenate_reductase_ArsC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 618, "taxa" 2197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2336, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2336, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1777}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0474", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0474"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
