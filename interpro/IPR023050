{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The PyrR protein from Bacillus subtilis and many other bacteria is a bifunctional protein. Its primary function is the regulation of expression of pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) genes by binding to specific sites on pyr mRNA in a uridine nucleotide-dependent manner and altering the folding of downstream RNA to promote termination of transcription. PyrR also catalyzes the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) reaction ([ec:2.4.2.9]) even though it bears little amino acid sequence similarity to other bacterial UPRTases [[cite:PUB00053983]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2igb", "name" "Crystal Structure of PyrR, The Regulator Of The Pyrimidine Biosynthetic Operon In Bacillus caldolyticus, UMP-bound form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029057", "name" "Phosphoribosyltransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01219" "Bifunctional protein PyrR [pyrR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional protein PyrR", "short" "PyrR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3921, "taxa" 14878, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16415, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12623}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
