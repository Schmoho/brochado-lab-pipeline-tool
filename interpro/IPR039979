{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The splicing factor Prp18 is required for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing. PRP18 appears to be primarily associated with the U5 snRNP.</p>\r\n<p>The structure of a large fragment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prp18 is known [[cite:PUB00007365]]. This fragment is fully active in yeast splicing<i>in vitro</i>and includes the sequences of Prp18 that have been evolutionarily conserved. The core structure consists of five α-helices that adopt a novel fold. The most highly conserved region of Prp18, a nearly invariant stretch of 19 aa, forms part of a loop between two α-helices and may interact with the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles [[cite:PUB00007365]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13007" "PRE-MRNA SPLICING FACTOR-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor 18", "short" "PRPF18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2533, "taxa" 10492, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5403, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5403, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3050}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039979", :literature {"PUB00007365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Jiang J" "Horowitz DS" "Xu RM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
