Group A FLAs are characterised by a single fasciclin domain that is flanked by AGP regions and a C-terminal GPI-anchor signal; group B contain two fasciclin domains flanking an AGP region and lack a C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence; group C have a variable domain structure with one or two fasciclin domains, one or two AGP regions, and a C-terminal GPI anchor signal; FLAs 4 and 19 to 21 formed group D as they have low similarity to each other or to any of the other FLAs [[cite:PUB00078648]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family represents Group A Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs) from plants, which includes FLAs 6, 7, 9,11,12 and 13  from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00078648]].
