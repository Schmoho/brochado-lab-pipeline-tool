{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycosyltransferase family 9 [cazy:GT9] comprises enzymes with two known activity; lipopolysaccharide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase ([ec:2.4.1.56]), heptosyltransferase ([ec:2.4]).</p>\n\n<p>Heptosyltransferase I is thought to add L-glycero-D-manno-heptose to the inner 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue of the lipopolysaccharide core [[cite:PUB00003027]]. Heptosyltransferase II is a glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the inner core region of lipopolysaccharide [[cite:PUB00006687]]. Lipopolysaccharide is a major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. It is composed of three domains; lipid A, Core oligosaccharide and the O-antigen. These enzymes transfer heptose to the lipopolysaccharide core [[cite:PUB00003027]].</p>\n\n<p>This family includes bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferases (BAHTs) [[cite:PUB00151498], [cite:PUB00151499], [cite:PUB00151500]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases.

This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families.
