{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes two closely related human proteins SHKBP1 (also known as SETA-binding protein 1) and Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain Containing protein 3 (KCTD3), which correspond to group D of KCTD family [[cite:PUB00098940], [cite:PUB00099270], [cite:PUB00151189]]. The complete biological role of SHKBP1 has not yet been characterised, however, it has been associated with tumorigenesis. It interacts with cathepsin B and participates in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells [[cite:PUB00139493]]. It binds to SH3 domains of the SETA adapter protein, whose overexpression is related to brain tumours [[cite:PUB00151189]]. KCTD3 has been associated with neurogenetic and neurodevelopmental disorders. It is an accessory subunit of potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 3 (HCN3) as it interacts and increases its stability and cell surface expression [[cite:PUB00139591], [cite:PUB00151189]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4crh", "name" "Crystal structure of the BTB-T1 domain of human SHKBP1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15859" "SETA BINDING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SHKBP1/KCTD3", "short" "SHKBP1/KCTD3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 952, "taxa" 3812, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2949, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2949, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1816}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047876", :literature {"PUB00098940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Teng X" "Aouacheria A" "Lionnard L" "Metz KA" "Soane L" "Kamiya A" "Hardwick JM."], "ISO_journal" "CNS Neurosci Ther", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "CNS Neurosci Ther", "title" "KCTD: A new gene family involved in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "887-902", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31197948}, "PUB00099270" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Pinkas DM" "Sanvitale CE" "Bufton JC" "Sorrell FJ" "Solcan N" "Chalk R" "Doutch J" "Bullock AN."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "Structural complexity in the KCTD family of Cullin3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligases.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "3747-3761", "volume" "474", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28963344}, "PUB00139493" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Liu JP" "Liu NS" "Yuan HY" "Guo Q" "Lu H" "Li YY."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell Biochem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell Biochem", "title" "Human homologue of SETA binding protein 1 interacts with cathepsin B and participates in TNF-Induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "189-95", "volume" "292", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16733801}, "PUB00151189" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Angrisani A" "Di Fiore A" "De Smaele E" "Moretti M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Commun Signal", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Commun Signal", "title" "The emerging role of the KCTD proteins in cancer.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "56", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34001146}, "PUB00139591" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Cao-Ehlker X" "Zong X" "Hammelmann V" "Gruner C" "Fenske S" "Michalakis S" "Wahl-Schott C" "Biel M."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Up-regulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 3 (HCN3) by specific interaction with K+ channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 3 (KCTD3).", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "7580-7589", "volume" "288", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23382386}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047876", "name" "SHKBP1/KCTD3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
