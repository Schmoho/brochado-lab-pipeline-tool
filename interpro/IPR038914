{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DCAFs, Ddb1- and Cul4-associated factors, are substrate receptors for the Cul4-Ddb1 Ubiquitin Ligase. There are 18 different factors, the majority of which are WD40-repeat-proteins [[cite:PUB00067700]]. This family represents the DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 15 (DCAF15), which is the substrate-recognition component of the DCX(DCAF15) complex, a cullin-4-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that mediates ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins [[cite:PUB00067700]], and acts as a regulator of the natural killer (NK) cells effector functions [[cite:PUB00102154]]. Aryl sulfonamide anticancer agents appear to promote binding of DCAF15 to the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of RBM39, which suggests that derivatives of the aryl-sulfonamides may be used to target other RRM-containing proteins [[cite:PUB00102153], [cite:PUB00102152]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28541" "DDB1- AND CUL4-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 15"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 15", "short" "DCAF15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 536, "taxa" 2589, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1035, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1035, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 609}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038914", :literature {"PUB00067700" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Jin J" "Arias EE" "Chen J" "Harper JW" "Walter JC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
