{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains proteins of unknown function, which include HutD from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ves from Escherichia coli K12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HutD from P. fluorescens is a component of the histidine uptake and utilisation operon. HutD is operonic with the well characterised repressor protein HutC. Genetic analysis using transcriptional fusions (lacZ) and deletion mutants shows that hutD is necessary to maintain fitness in environments replete with histidine. HutD probably sets an upper bound on the level of hut operon transcription [[cite:PUB00044765]]. The mechanistic basis is unknown, but in silico molecular docking studies based on the crystal structure of HutD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa show that urocanate (the first breakdown product of histidine) docks with the active site of HutD.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yll", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Conserved Protein of Unknown Function PA5104 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37943" "PROTEIN VES"}, "pfam" {"PF05962" "HutD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family HutD/Ves", "short" "Uncharacterised_HutD/Ves"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 1636, "taxa" 7687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8016, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7940, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5993}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010282", :literature {"PUB00044765" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zhang XX" "Rainey PB."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.107.075713", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Genetic analysis of the histidine utilization (hut) genes in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "2165-76", "volume" "176", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17717196}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010282", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family HutD/Ves", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023482", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ves", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 32, "alignment:full" 1723}}}
