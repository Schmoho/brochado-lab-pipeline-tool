{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of unknown function found in Phytoreovirus. Family members include the Rice dwarf virus Pns11 and Pns12 proteins. Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is an icosahedral, double-layered particle. The viral genome consists of 12 segmented dsRNAs that encode seven structural (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8 and P9) and five non-structural (Pns4, Pns6, Pns10, Pns11 and Pns12) proteins. Pns11 is known to bind nucleic acids and Pns12 is a phosphorylated protein. The non-structural proteins Pns6, Pns11 and Pns12 of RDV are the major constituents of the matrix of viral inclusions in which the assembly of progeny virions and the synthesis of viral RNA are thought to occur [[cite:PUB00085336]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17464" "Non-structural protein 11 and 12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Non-structural protein 11/12", "short" "Pns11/12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 49, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035351", :literature {"PUB00085336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 2", "authors" ["Wei T" "Shimizu T" "Hagiwara K" "Kikuchi A" "Moriyasu Y" "Suzuki N" "Chen H" "Omura T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
