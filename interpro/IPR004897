{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Paramyxoviral P genes are able to generate more than one product, using alternative reading frames and RNA editing. The P gene encodes the structural phosphoprotein P. In addition, it encodes several non-structural proteins present in the infected cell but not in the virus particle. This family includes phosphoprotein P and the non-structural phosphoprotein V from different paramyxoviruses. Phosphoprotein P is a modular protein organised into two moieties that are both functionally and structurally distinct: a well-conserved C-terminal moiety that contains all the regions required for transcription, and a poorly conserved, intrinsically unstructured N-terminal moiety that provides several additional functions required for replication. The N-terminal moiety is responsible for binding to newly synthesized free N(0) (nucleoprotein that has not yet bound RNA), in order to prevent the binding of N(0) to cellular RNA. The C-terminal moiety consists of an oligomerisation domain, an N-RNA (nucleoprotein-RNA)-binding domain and an L polymerase-binding domain [[cite:PUB00020838], [cite:PUB00031362]]. Phosphoprotein P is essential for the activity of the RNA polymerase complex which it forms with the L subunit. Although all the catalytic activities of the polymerase are associated with the L subunit, its function requires specific interactions with phosphoprotein P [[cite:PUB00007719]]. The P and V phosphoproteins are amino co-terminal, but diverge at their C-termini. This difference is generated by an RNA-editing mechanism in which one or two non-templated G residues are inserted into P-gene-derived mRNA. In Measles virus and Sendai virus, one G residue is inserted and the edited transcript encodes the V protein. In Mumps virus, Simian virus 5 and Newcastle disease virus, two G residues are inserted, and the edited transcript codes for the P protein [[cite:PUB00007719]]. Being phosphoproteins, both P and V are rich in serine and threonine residues over their whole lengths. In addition, the V proteins are rich in cysteine residues at the C-termini [[cite:PUB00007720]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1t6o", "name" "Nucleocapsid-binding domain of the measles virus P protein (amino acids 457-507) in complex with amino acids 486-505 of the measles virus N protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03210" "Paramyxovirus P/V phosphoprotein C-terminal"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "P/V phosphoprotein, paramyxoviral", "short" "P/V_Pprotein_paramyxoviral"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 79, "taxa" 348, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2528, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004897", :literature {"PUB00007719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Bousse T" "Takimoto T" "Matrosovich T" "Portner A."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/viro.2001.0881", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Two regions of the P protein are required to be active with the L protein for human parainfluenza virus type 1 RNA polymerase activity.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "306-14", "volume" "283", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11336555}, "PUB00007720" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Steward M" "Vipond IB" "Millar NS" "Emmerson PT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
