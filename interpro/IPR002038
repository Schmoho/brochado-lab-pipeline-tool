One of the most abundant products of osteoblasts is osteopontin, a glycosylated phosphoprotein with a high acidic amino acid content and one copy of the cell attachment sequence RGD [[cite:PUB00002704]]. It is thought that osteopontin may act as a bridge between osteoblasts and the apatite mineral of the bone [[cite:PUB00002704]].
