{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MAPK-interacting and spindle-stabilising protein (MISS) is rich in prolines and has four potential MAPK-phosphorylation sites, a MAPK-docking site, a PEST sequence (PEST motif) and a bipartite nuclear localisation signal. The endogenous protein accumulates during mouse meiotic maturation and is found as discrete dots on the MII (meiosis metaphase II) spindle. MISS is the first example of a physiological MAPK-substrate that is stabilised in MII that specifically regulates MII spindle integrity during the cytostatic factor (CSF) arrest [[cite:PUB00075980]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35973" "MAPK-INTERACTING AND SPINDLE-STABILIZING PROTEIN-LIKE"}, "pfam" {"PF15822" "MAPK-interacting and spindle-stabilising protein-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MAPK-interacting and spindle-stabilising protein", "short" "MISS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 500, "taxa" 1541, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 655, "sets" 0, "proteins" 645, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 496}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031653", :literature {"PUB00075980" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lefebvre C" "Terret ME" "Djiane A" "Rassinier P" "Maro B" "Verlhac MH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
