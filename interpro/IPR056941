{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents RpoH-modulating protein from Enterobacteria phage T4 (Mrh), the uncharacterised Y01F from bacteriophage T4 and similar sequences from tailed bacteriophages. Mrh plays a role in transcriptional regulation of late T4 genes. It modulates the phosphorylation status of host heat shock sigma factor RpoH which is an initiation factor that promotes the attachment of host RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites [[cite:PUB00155855]]. Structure prediction suggests that this protein may oligomerise with the C terminus contacting the next subunit in a cyclic homo-oligomer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24070" "T4 MRH-like protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RpoH-modulating protein-like", "short" "Mrh-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 595, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 660, "sets" 0, "proteins" 659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056941", :literature {"PUB00155855" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Mosig G" "Colowick NE" "Pietz BC."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00238-8", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Several new bacteriophage T4 genes, mapped by sequencing deletion endpoints between genes 56 (dCTPase) and dda (a DNA-dependent ATPase-helicase) modulate transcription.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "143-55", "volume" "223", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9858714}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056941", "name" "RpoH-modulating protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 48}}}
