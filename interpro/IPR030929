{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Both Aah (autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase) and TibC are protein O-heptosyltransferases that act on multiple sites from repeat regions of proteins exported by autotransporters. Aah glycosylates AIDA (autotransporter adhesin involved in diffuse adherence) and TibC acts on TibA (enterotoxigenic invasion locus B). TibC is able to replace Aah, suggesting that both represent a novel class of heptosyltransferases specifically transferring heptose residues onto multiple sites of a protein backbone [[cite:PUB00074213], [cite:PUB00074214]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04414" "autotransporter strand-loop-strand O-heptosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyltransferase Aah/TibC-like", "short" "Aah/TibC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 90, "taxa" 643, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 583, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 432}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1080", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1080"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
