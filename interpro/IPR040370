It strongly inhibits ebolavirus transcription and replication through the formation of a complex with viral RNA-bound nucleocapsid (NP) that prevents the transport of NP to the cell surface [[cite:PUB00101541]]. It has also been shown to interact with centrosomal protein CEP164 [[cite:PUB00061291]], which is required for primary (nonmotile) cilium formation [[cite:PUB00078201]]. CCDC92 is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. Studies in wild-type (WT) and CCCDC92 whole-body knockout (KO) mice, it was found that CCDC92 KO reduced obesity and increased insulin sensitivity under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, it inhibited macrophage infiltration and fibrosis in white adipose tissue (WAT), which might protect against adipose tissue dysfunction. This suggests a critical role of CCDC92 in metabolism, and may be a potential target for treating obesity and insulin resistance [[cite:PUB00151544]].</p>\n\n<p>Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 74A/B are spindle-localized proteins that bind directly to microtubules through two separate domains and bundle microtubules, being important K-fiber crosslinkers required for bipolar spindle formation and chromosome alignment [[cite:PUB00151543]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14882" "COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING 74A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 74A/74B/92", "short" "CCDC74A/CCDC74B/CCDC92"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 877, "taxa" 3300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2888, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2888, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1871}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040370", :literature {"PUB00151543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhou H" "Zheng T" "Wang T" "Li Q" "Wang F" "Liang X" "Chen J" "Teng J."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-019-0694-9", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "CCDC74A/B are K-fiber crosslinkers required for chromosomal alignment.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "73", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31521166}, "PUB00101541" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kuroda M" "Halfmann PJ" "Hill-Batorski L" "Ozawa M" "Lopes TJS" "Neumann G" "Schoggins JW" "Rice CM" "Kawaoka Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Identification of interferon-stimulated genes that attenuate Ebola virus infection.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "2953", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32528005}, "PUB00061291" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chaki M" "Airik R" "Ghosh AK" "Giles RH" "Chen R" "Slaats GG" "Wang H" "Hurd TW" "Zhou W" "Cluckey A" "Gee HY" "Ramaswami G" "Hong CJ" "Hamilton BA" "Cervenka I" "Ganji RS" "Bryja V" "Arts HH" "van Reeuwijk J" "Oud MM" "Letteboer SJ" "Roepman R" "Husson H" "Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O" "Yasunaga T" "Walz G" "Eley L" "Sayer JA" "Schermer B" "Liebau MC" "Benzing T" "Le Corre S" "Drummond I" "Janssen S" "Allen SJ" "Natarajan S" "O'Toole JF" "Attanasio M" "Saunier S" "Antignac C" "Koenekoop RK" "Ren H" "Lopez I" "Nayir A" "Stoetzel C" "Dollfus H" "Massoudi R" "Gleeson JG" "Andreoli SP" "Doherty DG" "Lindstrad A" "Golzio C" "Katsanis N" "Pape L" "Abboud EB" "Al-Rajhi AA" "Lewis RA" "Omran H" "Lee EY" "Wang S" "Sekiguchi JM" "Saunders R" "Johnson CA" "Garner E" "Vanselow K" "Andersen JS" "Shlomai J" "Nurnberg G" "Nurnberg P" "Levy S" "Smogorzewska A" "Otto EA" "Hildebrandt F."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.028", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Exome Capture Reveals ZNF423 and CEP164 Mutations, Linking Renal Ciliopathies to DNA Damage Response Signaling.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "533-48", "volume" "150", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22863007}, "PUB00078201" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Graser S" "Stierhof YD" "Lavoie SB" "Gassner OS" "Lamla S" "Le Clech M" "Nigg EA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
