{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>KCNQ channels (also known as KQT-like channels) differ from other voltage-gated 6 TM helix channels, chiefly in that they possess no tetramerisation domain. Consequently, they rely on interaction with accessory subunits, or form heterotetramers with other members of the family [[cite:PUB00008295]]. Currently, 5 members of the KCNQ family are known.  These have been found to be widely distributed within the body, having been shown to be expressed in the heart, brain, pancreas, lung, placenta and ear.  They were initially cloned as a result of a search for proteins involved in cardiac arhythmia.  Subsequently, mutations in other KCNQ family members have been shown to be responsible for some forms of hereditary deafness [[cite:PUB00008296]] and benign familial neonatal epilepsy [[cite:PUB00008297]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47735" "POTASSIUM VOLTAGE-GATED CHANNEL SUBFAMILY KQT MEMBER 4"}, "prints" {"PR01459" "KCNQCHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Potassium channel, voltage dependent, KCNQ", "short" "K_chnl_volt-dep_KCNQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 50, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1037, "taxa" 4282, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12989, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11823, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7306}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003937", :literature {"PUB00008296" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang Q" "Curran ME" "Splawski I" "Burn TC" "Millholland JM" "VanRaay TJ" "Shen J" "Timothy KW" "Vincent GM" "de Jager T" "Schwartz PJ" "Toubin JA" "Moss AJ" "Atkinson DL" "Landes GM" "Connors TD" "Keating MT."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
