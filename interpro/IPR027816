{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Membrane-anchored junction protein (MAJIN) is a meiosis-specific telomere-associated protein involved in meiotic telomere attachment to the nucleus inner membrane, a crucial step for homologous pairing and synapsis. It is a component of the MAJIN-TERB1-TERB2 complex, which promotes telomere cap exchange by mediating attachment of telomeric DNA to the inner nuclear membrane and replacement of the protective cap of telomeric chromosomes: in early meiosis, the MAJIN-TERB1-TERB2 complex associates with telomeric DNA and the shelterin/telosome complex. During prophase, the complex matures and promotes release of the shelterin/telosome complex from telomeric DNA. In the complex, MAJIN acts as the anchoring subunit to the nucleus inner membrane. MAJIN shows DNA-binding activity, possibly for the stabilization of telomere attachment on the nucleus inner membrane [[cite:PUB00077546]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6gny", "name" "Crystal structure of the MAJIN-TERB2 heterotetrameric complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35824" "MEMBRANE-ANCHORED JUNCTION PROTEIN MAJIN"}, "pfam" {"PF15077" "Membrane-anchored junction protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane-anchored junction protein", "short" "MAJIN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 330, "taxa" 1384, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 720, "sets" 0, "proteins" 620, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 360}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027816", :literature {"PUB00077546" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Shibuya H" "Hernandez-Hernandez A" "Morimoto A" "Negishi L" "Hoog C" "Watanabe Y."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.030", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "MAJIN Links Telomeric DNA to the Nuclear Membrane by Exchanging Telomere Cap.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1252-66", "volume" "163", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26548954}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027816", "name" "Membrane-anchored junction protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 529}}}
