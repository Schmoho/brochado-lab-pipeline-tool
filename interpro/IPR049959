{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from mycobacteria, including MAP_0585 from Mycolicibacterium paratuberculosis ([swissprot:Q743K0]). Members of this family average about 310 amino acids in length, including a signal peptide-containing N-terminal region of about 30 amino acids, a conserved C-terminal region of about 130 amino acids, and a central intrinsically disordered region of about 150 amino acids, rich in Pro, Gly, and hydrophilic residues. The protein has been studied as a vaccine component but is otherwise uncharacterised [[cite:PUB00153506], [cite:PUB00153507]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043060" "MAP_0585 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MAP_0585-like", "short" "MAP_0585-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 113, "sets" 0, "proteins" 113, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 97}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049959", :literature {"PUB00153506" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bannantine JP" "Stabel JR" "Kapur V."], "ISO_journal" "Vaccines (Basel)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10040518", "medline_journal" "Vaccines (Basel)", "title" "Immunological Evaluation of Goats Immunized with a Commercial Vaccine against Johne's Disease.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "518", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35455267}, "PUB00153507" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bannantine JP" "Wadhwa A" "Stabel JR" "Eda S."], "ISO_journal" "Vet Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci6040088", "medline_journal" "Vet Sci", "title" "Characterization of Ethanol Extracted Cell Wall Components of <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> Subsp. <i>paratuberculosis</i>.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "E88", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31683552}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049959", "name" "MAP_0585-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
