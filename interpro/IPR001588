{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Caseins [[cite:PUB00004950]] are the major protein constituent of milk. In milk, caseins interact with calcium phosphate, forming large stable colloidal particles termed micelles. These micelles make it possible to maintain a supersaturated calcium phosphate concentration in milk, providing the newborn with sufficient calcium phosphate for the mineralisation of calcified tissues [[cite:PUB00062158]]. Caseins can be classified into two families; the first consists of the kappa-caseins, and the second groups the alpha-s1, alpha-s2, and beta-caseins. The alpha/beta caseins are a rapidly diverging family of proteins [[cite:PUB00062170], [cite:PUB00062171]]. However two regions are conserved: a cluster of phosphorylated serine residues and the signal sequence.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Alpha-s2 casein is known as epsilon-casein in mouse, gamma-casein in rat and casein-A in guinea pig.
