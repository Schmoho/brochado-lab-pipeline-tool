{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes Centrosomal protein of 112 kDa which is thought to be involved in the organisation and function of the centrosome, a cellular structure critical for the organisation of microtubules and the segregation of chromosomes during cell division [[cite:PUB00060832]]. Members of this family are known to play a role in the stabilization of microtubules as well as in the maintenance of centrosome cohesion and positioning [[cite:PUB00155340]]. They may also be implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly during the G2/M transition. Mutations in these proteins have been associated with various types of cancer, underscoring their importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division [[cite:PUB00155339]]. In neurons, it localises to the cytoplasm of dendrites and is also enriched in the nucleus where it interacts with the RNA polymerase III transcriptional repressor Maf1 to regulate gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor surface expression. In addition, the protein has been identified as a component of the human centrosome [[cite:PUB00155338]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18871" "CENTROSOMAL PROTEIN OF 112 KDA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Centrosomal protein of 112 kDa", "short" "CEP112"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 734, "taxa" 2820, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2084, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2084, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1286}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055310", :literature {"PUB00155339" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gopalakrishnan C" "Kamaraj B" "Purohit R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Biochem Biophys", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12013-014-0153-8", "medline_journal" "Cell Biochem Biophys", "title" "Mutations in microRNA binding sites of CEP genes involved in cancer.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1933-42", "volume" "70", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25115610}, "PUB00060832" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Jakobsen L" "Vanselow K" "Skogs M" "Toyoda Y" "Lundberg E" "Poser I" "Falkenby LG" "Bennetzen M" "Westendorf J" "Nigg EA" "Uhlen M" "Hyman AA" "Andersen JS."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.63", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Novel asymmetrically localizing components of human centrosomes identified by complementary proteomics methods.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1520-35", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21399614}, "PUB00155338" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Smith KR" "Oliver PL" "Lumb MJ" "Arancibia-Carcamo IL" "Revilla-Sanchez R" "Brandon NJ" "Moss SJ" "Kittler JT."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell Neurosci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcn.2010.04.004", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell Neurosci", "title" "Identification and characterisation of a Maf1/Macoco protein complex that interacts with GABAA receptors in neurons.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "330-41", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20417281}, "PUB00155340" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kumar A" "Rajendran V" "Sethumadhavan R" "Purohit R."], "ISO_journal" "Protoplasma", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00709-013-0488-9", "medline_journal" "Protoplasma", "title" "CEP proteins: the knights of centrosome dynasty.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "965-83", "volume" "250", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23456457}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055310", "name" "Centrosomal protein of 112 kDa", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
