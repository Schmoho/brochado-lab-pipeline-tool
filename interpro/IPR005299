{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of plant methyltransferases contains enzymes that act on a variety of substrates including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 7-methylxanthine. Caffeine is synthesised through sequential three-step methylation of xanthine derivatives at positions 7-N, 3-N, and 1-N [[cite:PUB00040394], [cite:PUB00096633]]. The protein 7-methylxanthine methyltransferase (designated as CaMXMT) catalyses the second step to produce theobromine [[cite:PUB00008390]]. The protein Carlactonoate CLA methyltransferase (CLAMT) catalyses the biosynthesis of (11R)-methyl carlactonoate from (11R)-carlactonoate [[cite:PUB00153148]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2efj", "name" "The structure of 1,7 dimethylxanthine methyltransferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042086", "name" "Methyltransferase, alpha-helical capping domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31009" "S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE:CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE FAMILY PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF03492" "SAM dependent carboxyl methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SAM dependent carboxyl methyltransferase", "short" "MeTrfase_7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 141, "proteomes" 621, "taxa" 3110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11790, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7236}, "pathways" 153}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1420", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1420"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
