{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pantothenate kinase (PanK, [ec:2.7.1.33]) catalyses the conversion of CAATP and pantothenate to ADP and D-4'-phosphopantothenate, the key regulatory step in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) [[cite:PUB00015018]]. Members in this entry represents a two-domain form with an additional C-terminal domain of unknown function. This type of pantothenate kinase is typical for eukaryotes. It is not related by sequence to bacterial PanK ([pirsf:PIRSF000545]) and differs in a number of biochemical properties (such as inhibition by acetyl-CoA) [[cite:PUB00015018], [cite:PUB00015017]].
