{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several animal galactose-3-O-sulphotransferases, including GAL3ST1-4. GAL3ST1 (also known as Cst, cerebroside sulfotransferase) is responsible for the biosynthesis of two types of sulfoglycolipids, sulfatide (HSO3-3-galactosylceramide) and seminolipid (HSO3-3-monogalactosylalkylacylglycerol), in mammals. It catalyses the sulfation of membrane glycolipids and seems to prefer beta-glycosides at the non-reducing termini of sugar chains attached to a lipid moiety. It also catalyses the synthesis of galactosylceramide sulfate (sulfatide), a major lipid component of the myelin sheath and of monogalactosylalkylacylglycerol sulfate (seminolipid), present in spermatocytes [[cite:PUB00076962]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06990" "Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR14647" "GALACTOSE-3-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase", "short" "Gal-3-0_sulfotransfrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 80, "proteomes" 860, "taxa" 3783, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6206, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3832}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
