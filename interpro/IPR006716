{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the fungal C-8 sterol isomerase and mammalian sigma1 receptor. C-8 sterol isomerase (delta-8--delta-7 sterol isomerase), catalyses a reaction in ergosterol biosynthesis, which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols [[cite:PUB00008505]]. Sigma 1 receptor is a low molecular mass mammalian protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum [[cite:PUB00008506]], which interacts with endogenous steroid hormones, such as progesterone and testosterone [[cite:PUB00008507]]. It also binds the sigma ligands, which are a set of chemically unrelated drugs including haloperidol, pentazocine, and ditolylguanidine [[cite:PUB00008506]]. Sigma1 effectors are not well understood, but sigma1 agonists have been observed to affect NMDA receptor function, the alpha-adrenergic system and opioid analgesia.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10868" "SIGMA 1-TYPE OPIOID RECEPTOR-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF04622" "ERG2 and Sigma1 receptor like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ERG2/sigma1 receptor-like", "short" "ERG2_sigma1_rcpt-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 41, "proteomes" 2018, "taxa" 6510, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3578, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3475, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2282}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1609", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1609"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006716", :literature {"PUB00008505" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Keon JP" "James CS" "Court S" "Baden-Daintree C" "Bailey AM" "Burden RS" "Bard M" "Hargreaves JA."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
