{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arv1 is a transmembrane protein, with potential zinc-binding motifs, that mediates sterol homeostasis. Its action is important in lipid homeostasis, which prevents free sterol toxicity [[cite:PUB00009883]]. Arv1 contains a homology domain (AHD), which consists of an N-terminal cysteine-rich subdomain with a putative zinc-binding motif, followed by a C-terminal subdomain of 33 amino acids. The C-terminal subdomain of the AHD is critical for the protein's function [[cite:PUB00043518]]. In yeast, Arv1p is important for the delivery of an early glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPI intermediate, GlcN-acylPI, to the first mannosyltransferase of GPI synthesis in the ER lumen [[cite:PUB00043519]]. It is important for the traffic of sterol in yeast and in humans. In eukaryotic cells, it may fuction in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway as a transporter of ceramides between the ER and Golgi [[cite:PUB00043520]]. Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to encode 2 ARV proteins (ARV1 and ARV2) both of which contain the AHD domain. This family also includes ARV2 from A. thaliana [[cite:PUB00043518]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04161" "Arv1-like family"}, "panther" {"PTHR14467" "ARV1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arv1 protein", "short" "Arv1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 85, "proteomes" 2336, "taxa" 7850, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4247, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4034, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2649}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007290", :literature {"PUB00009883" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Tinkelenberg AH" "Liu Y" "Alcantara F" "Khan S" "Guo Z" "Bard M" "Sturley SL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
