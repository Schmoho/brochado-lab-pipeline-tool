{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. Characterised proteins within this family include glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.99.5]), sarcosine oxidase beta subunit ([ec:1.5.3.1]) and a number of deaminating amino acid oxidases ([ec:1.4.]). These genes have been consistently observed in a genomic context including genes for the import and catabolism of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP). If the substrate of this oxidoreductase is AEP itself, then it is probably acting in the manner of a deaminating oxidase, resulting in the same product (phosphonoacetaldehyde) as the transaminase PhnW, but releasing ammonia instead of coupling to pyruvate:alanine. Alternatively, it is reasonable to suppose that the various ABC cassette transporters which are also associated with these loci allow the import of phosphonates closely related to AEP which may not be substrates for PhnW.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03329" "putative aminophosphonate oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative aminophosphonate oxidoreductase", "short" "NH2-phosphonate_OxRdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 700, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 761, "sets" 0, "proteins" 761, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 578}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0720", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0720"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017715", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017715", "name" "Putative aminophosphonate oxidoreductase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
