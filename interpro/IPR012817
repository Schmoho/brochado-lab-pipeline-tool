{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenases. This enzyme is a homodimeric intradiol dioxygenase that degrade chlorocatechols via the addition of molecular oxygen and the subsequent cleavage between two adjacent hydroxyl groups. This reaction is part of the modified ortho-cleavage pathway which is a central oxidative bacterial pathway that channels chlorocatechols, derived from the degradation of chlorinated benzoic acids, phenoxyacetic acids, phenols, benzenes, and other aromatics into the energy-generating tricarboxylic acid pathway [[cite:PUB00080933]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This protein is closely related to catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, [interpro:IPR012801], [ec:1.13.11.1] [[cite:PUB00015256]].
