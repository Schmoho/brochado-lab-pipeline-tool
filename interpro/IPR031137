{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Growth-regulating factors (GRFs) are transcription factors that play a regulatory role in growth and development of leaves and cotyledons [[cite:PUB00074745], [cite:PUB00043129], [cite:PUB00074747]]. Typical GRFs contain QLQ and WRC domains. The QLQ domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the WRC domain contains a nuclear localisation signal and a DNA-binding motif [[cite:PUB00043129]]. Arabidopsis have 9 GRF members (AtGRF1-9): AtGRF1 and AtGRF2 act as transcriptional activators; AtGRF1 and AtGRF3 contribute to the regulation of various biological processes associated with defense response and disease resistance; AtGRF7 has been reported to function as transcriptional repressor of osmotic stress-responsive genes by binding to the cis-element TGTCAGG [[cite:PUB00074745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31602" "GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Growth-regulating factor", "short" "GRF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 997, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5748, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5748, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3402}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031137", :literature {"PUB00043129" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Kim JH" "Kende H."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
