{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is represented by YfiT, which is a 19kDa polypeptide from Bacillus subtilis, belonging to a small sequence family with members predominantly from Gram-positive bacteria. The crystal structure of YfiT in complex with Ni(2+) has been determined to a resolution of 1.7 A [[cite:PUB00030833]]. YfiT exists as a dimer and binds Ni(2+) in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The protein has an unusual four-helix bundle topology and coordinates Ni(2+) in an octahedral geometry with three conserved histidines and three waters. Although there is no similarity in their overall structures, the coordination geometry of the metal and the residues that constitute the putative active site in YfiT are similar to those of metalloproteases such as thermolysin. YfiT may therefore function as a metal-dependent hydrolase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rxq", "name" "YfiT from Bacillus subtilis is a probable metal-dependent hydrolase with an unusual four-helix bundle topology"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR034660", "name" "DinB/YfiT-like putative metalloenzymes", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01256" "Putative metal-dependent hydrolase <locus_tag>"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative metal-dependent hydrolase YfiT", "short" "Put_metal_dep_hydrolase_YfiT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 507, "taxa" 1996, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1923, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1923, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1463}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023774", :literature {"PUB00030833" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["Rajan SS" "Yang X" "Shuvalova L" "Collart F" "Anderson WF."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi048665r", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "YfiT from Bacillus subtilis is a probable metal-dependent hydrolase with an unusual four-helix bundle topology.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "15472-9", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15581359}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023774", "name" "Putative metal-dependent hydrolase YfiT", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
