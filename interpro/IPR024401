{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of WYL domain containing proteins. WYL is named for three conserved amino acids found in a subset of domains of this superfamily. These residues are not strongly conserved throughout the family. Rather, the conservation pattern includes four basic residues and a position often occupied by a cysteine [[cite:PUB00085051]], which are predicted to line a ligand-binding groove typical of the Sm-like SH3 Î²-barrels. It is predicted to be a ligand-sensing domain that could bind negatively charged ligands, such as nucleotides or nucleic acid fragments, to regulate CRISPR-Cas and other defense systems such as the abortive infection AbiG system [[cite:PUB00085051]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10902" "WYL_2, Sm-like SH3 beta-barrel fold"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WYL domain containing protein", "short" "WYL_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 156, "taxa" 1655, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1596, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1576, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 680}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024401", :literature {"PUB00085051" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Makarova KS" "Anantharaman V" "Grishin NV" "Koonin EV" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Front Genet", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2014.00102", "medline_journal" "Front Genet", "title" "CARF and WYL domains: ligand-binding regulators of prokaryotic defense systems.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "102", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24817877}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024401", "name" "WYL domain containing protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 35, "alignment:full" 223}}}
