{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the phage shock protein PspA, from the phage shock operon. This is a narrower family than the set of PspA and its homologs, sometimes several in a genome, represented in [interpro:IPR007157]. PspA is required for membrane integrity, as it maintains the proton motive force under stress conditions that include over expression of certain phage secretins, heat shock, ethanol and protein export defects [[cite:PUB00034604]]. PspA also negatively regulates expression of the pspABCDE promoter and of pspG through negative regulation of the psp-specific transcriptional activator PspF [[cite:PUB00150949], [cite:PUB00034602]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02977" "phage shock protein PspA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage shock protein, PspA", "short" "Phageshock_PspA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 782, "taxa" 3563, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3668, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3668, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2845}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0648", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0648"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014319", :literature {"PUB00034604" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kleerebezem M" "Crielaard W" "Tommassen J."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=8598199", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Involvement of stress protein PspA (phage shock protein A) of Escherichia coli in maintenance of the protonmotive force under stress conditions.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "162-71", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8598199}, "PUB00150949" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Joly N" "Burrows PC" "Engl C" "Jovanovic G" "Buck M."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "A lower-order oligomer form of phage shock protein A (PspA) stably associates with the hexameric AAA(+) transcription activator protein PspF for negative regulation.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "764-75", "volume" "394", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19804784}, "PUB00034602" {"URL" nil, "issue" "53", "authors" ["Lloyd LJ" "Jones SE" "Jovanovic G" "Gyaneshwar P" "Rolfe MD" "Thompson A" "Hinton JC" "Buck M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
