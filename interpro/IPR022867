{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MsrPQ is an enzymatic system that repairs proteins containing methionine sulfoxide in the bacterial cell envelope. MsrP, a molybdo-enzyme, and MsrQ, a haem-binding membrane protein, are widely conserved throughout Gram-negative bacteria. MsrPQ uses electrons from the respiratory chain, which represents a novel mechanism to import reducing equivalents into the bacterial cell envelope.
