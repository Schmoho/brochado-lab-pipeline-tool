{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fermitin, also known as Unc-112-related protein [[cite:PUB00087692]], functions as a mediator of integrin inside-out signalling. The recruitment of Fermitin proteins and Talin to the membrane mediates the terminal event of integrin signalling, via interaction with integrin beta subunits [[cite:PUB00087697]]. Fermatin has a FERM domain interrupted with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain [[cite:PUB00087693]]. Fermitin family homologues (Fermt1, 2, and 3, also known as Kindlins) are each encoded by a different gene. In mammalian studies, Fermt1 is generally expressed in epithelial cells, Fermt2 is expressed in muscle tissues, and Fermt3 is expressed in hematopoietic lineages. Specifically Fermt2 is expressed in smooth and striated muscle tissues in mice and in the somites (a trunk muscle precursor) and neural crest in Xenopus embryos. As such it has been proposed that Fermt2 plays a role in cardiomyocyte and neural crest differentiation. Expression of mammalian Fermt3 is associated with hematopoietic lineages: the anterior ventral blood islands, vitelline veins, and early myeloid cells. In Xenopus embryos this expression, also include the notochord and cement gland [[cite:PUB00087694], [cite:PUB00087696]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4f7h", "name" "The crystal structure of kindlin-2 pleckstrin homology domain in free form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16160" "FERMITIN 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kindlin/fermitin", "short" "Kindlin/fermitin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1006, "taxa" 3965, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4970, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4970, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3052}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037843", :literature {"PUB00087697" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ye F" "Snider AK" "Ginsberg MH."], "ISO_journal" "Front Med", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-014-0317-3", "medline_journal" "Front Med", "title" "Talin and kindlin: the one-two punch in integrin activation.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "6-16", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24477625}, "PUB00087696" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Canning CA" "Chan JS" "Common JE" "Lane EB" "Jones CM."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
