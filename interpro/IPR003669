{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>All cellular organisms need thymidylate (dTMP) for the replication of their chromosomes, as dTMP is required for the biosynthesis of dTTP, a building block of DNA. Cells can produce thymidylate either de novo from dUMP or incorporate thymidine using thymidine kinase. The de novo pathway of dTMP synthesis requires a specific enzyme, thymidylate synthase, which methylates dUMP at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. There are two pathways for thymidylate synthesis, each utilising a different thymidylate synthase enzyme: ThyA ([ec:2.1.1.45]) and ThyX ([ec:2.1.1.148]) [[cite:PUB00015587]]. Both enzymes convert dUMP to dTMP, but there is no sequence identity between the two enzymes, and their mechanisms of action differ [[cite:PUB00035995]]. Only ThyX uses FAD as cofactor.</p>\r\n<p>The well studied thyA proteins catalyse the reductive methylation reaction of dUMP, with methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH(2)H(4)folate) serving as one-carbon donor and as source of reductive power. On the other hand the thyX family of thymidylate synthases contains FAD that is tightly bound by a novel fold. FAD mediates hydride transfer from NADPH during catalysis. Consequently, in the reaction catalysed by thyX, CH(2)H(4)folate serves only as a carbon donor and tetrahydrofolate (and not dihydrofolate as in the case of thyA) is produced [[cite:PUB00043680], [cite:PUB00039996]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4p5a", "name" "Crystal structure of a UMP/dUMP methylase PolB from Streptomyces cacaoi bound with 5-Br UMP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036098", "name" "Thymidylate synthase ThyX superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20175" "FAD-dependent thymidylate synthase (ThyX), mechanistically and structurally unrelated to thymidylate synthase (ThyA)"}, "panther" {"PTHR34934" "FLAVIN-DEPENDENT THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASE"}, "profile" {"PS51331" "Flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (thyX) domain profile"}, "hamap" {"MF_01408" "Flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase [thyX]"}, "pfam" {"PF02511" "Thymidylate synthase complementing protein"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02170" "FAD-dependent thymidylate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thymidylate synthase ThyX", "short" "Thymidylate_synthase_ThyX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 45, "domain_architectures" 46, "proteomes" 3778, "taxa" 18586, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24396, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21061, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13903}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
