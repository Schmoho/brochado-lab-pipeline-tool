{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rubella virus (RV), the sole member of the genus Rubivirus within the family Togaviridae, is a small enveloped, positive strand RNA virus. The nucleocapsid consists of 40S genomic RNA and a single species of capsid protein which is enveloped within a host-derived lipid bilayer containing two viral glycoproteins, E1 (58kDa) and E2 (42-46kDa). In virus infected cells, RV matures by budding either at the plasma membrane, or at the internal membranes depending on the cell type and enters adjacent uninfected cells by a membrane fusion process in the endosome, directed by E1-E2 heterodimers. The heterodimer formation is crucial for E1 transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and plasma membrane. In RV E1, a cysteine at position 82 is crucial for the E1-E2 heterodimer formation and cell surface expression of the two proteins. E1 has been shown to be a type 1 membrane protein, rich in cysteine residues with extensive intramolecular disulphide bonds [[cite:PUB00011455]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family is found together with [interpro:IPR008819] and [interpro:IPR008821].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4adi", "name" "Crystal structure of the Rubella virus envelope glycoprotein E1 in post-fusion form (crystal form I)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042500", "name" "Rubella membrane glycoprotein E1, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042498", "name" "Rubella membrane glycoprotein E1, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042499", "name" "Rubella membrane glycoprotein E1, domain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05748" "Rubella membrane glycoprotein E1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rubella membrane glycoprotein E1", "short" "Rubella_E1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 39, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2962, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2962, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008820", :literature {"PUB00011455" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Ramanujam M" "Hofmann J" "Nakhasi HL" "Atreya CD."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00374-4", "medline_journal" "Virus Res", "title" "Effect of site-directed asparagine to isoleucine substitutions at the N-linked E1 glycosylation sites on rubella virus viability.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "151-6", "volume" "81", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11682134}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019013", "name" "viral nucleocapsid", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008820", "name" "Rubella membrane glycoprotein E1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 6}}}
