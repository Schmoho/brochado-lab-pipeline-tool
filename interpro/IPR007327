{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The hD52 gene was originally identified through its elevated expression level in human breast carcinoma [[cite:PUB00009900]]. Cloning of D52 homologues from other species has indicated that D52 may play roles in calcium-mediated signal transduction and cell proliferation. Two human homologues of hD52, hD53 and hD54, have also been identified, demonstrating the existence of a novel gene/protein family. These proteins have an N-terminal coiled-coil that allows members to form homo- and heterodimers with each other [[cite:PUB00152873]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04201" "Tumour protein D52 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR19307" "TUMOR PROTEIN D52"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tumour protein D52", "short" "TPD52"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 34, "proteomes" 1012, "taxa" 4013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7523, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7478, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4789}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007327", :literature {"PUB00009900" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Byrne JA" "Nourse CR" "Basset P" "Gunning P."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1201604", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Identification of homo- and heteromeric interactions between members of the breast carcinoma-associated D52 protein family using the yeast two-hybrid system.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "873-81", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9484778}, "PUB00152873" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Boutros R" "Fanayan S" "Shehata M" "Byrne JA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.10.112", "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "The tumor protein D52 family: many pieces, many puzzles.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1115-21", "volume" "325", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15555543}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007327", "name" "Tumour protein D52", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 17, "alignment:full" 6893}}}
