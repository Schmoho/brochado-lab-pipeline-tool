{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Prohead assembly protein gp68 from Enterobacteria phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4) and similar proteins found in the viral family Myoviridae. Gp68 plays a role in the phage head size determination. About ten copies of this protein are found in the mature phage head [[cite:PUB00100118]]. It is predicted to have a secondary structure that consists of Î±-helical hairpins similar to supersecondary-structure-forming domains such as tetratricopeptide and HEAT repeats [[cite:PUB00100119]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004377" "Phage prohead core protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage T4, Prohead assembly protein gp68", "short" "Phage_T4_Gp68"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 58, "taxa" 951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 671, "sets" 0, "proteins" 671, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016415", :literature {"PUB00100119" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["M Iyer L" "Anantharaman V" "Krishnan A" "Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Viruses", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Viruses", "title" "Jumbo Phages: A Comparative Genomic Overview of Core Functions and Adaptions for Biological Conflicts.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33466489}, "PUB00100118" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Keller B" "Sengstag C" "Kellenberger E" "Bickle TA."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Gene 68, a new bacteriophage T4 gene which codes for the 17K prohead core protein is involved in head size determination.", "year" 1984, "raw_pages" "415-30", "volume" "179", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6512858}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016415", "name" "Bacteriophage T4, Prohead assembly protein gp68", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
