Mouse FGF15 has been shown to be stimulated when bile acids bind to farnesoid X receptor (FXR) [[cite:PUB00056848]], and is therefore thought to a factor in chronic bile acid diarrhoea and in certain metabolic disorders [[cite:PUB00067878]].</p>\r\n<p>FGF15 has been experimentally characterised in mouse, but has not been found in other species.  However, there is an orthologous human protein, FGF19, and together they share about 50% amino acid identity and display similar endocrine functions, so are often referred to as FGF15/19 [[cite:PUB00067865], [cite:PUB00067624]].  FGF15 and FGF19 differ from other FGFs due to subtle changes in their tertiary structure, they have low heparin binding affinity enabling them to diffuse away from their site of secretion and signal to distant cells.  FGF signaling through the FGF receptors is also different, as they require klotho protein cofactors rather than heparin sulfate proteoglycan [[cite:PUB00067865]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) plays a key role in enterohepatic signaling, regulation of liver bile acid biosynthesis, gallbladder motility and metabolic homeostasis [[cite:PUB00067624], [cite:PUB00056848], [cite:PUB00067865]].
