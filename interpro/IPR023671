{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ATPase RavA or regulatory ATPase variant A functions as an ATPase. It may play a role in metal insertion (metal-chelatase) or as a chaperone. RavA forms a complex with CadA, which represents a possible means of regulating RavA activity in response to acid stress conditions. This interaction results in an increase in RavA ATPase activity.
