{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Vps genes contribute to biofilm formation by directing biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide VPS (Vibrio polysaccharide), a major component of the biofilm matrix. These genes are divided into different classes with different predicted functions, of which class VI genes encode the proteins VpsF, VpsJ, VpsM, VpsP and VpsQ. Deletion of VpsF, VpsJ or VpsM results in the complete loss of colony corrugation, an inability to form pellicles, and a reduction in biofilm and VPS production, which implies that these proteins have an important role in biofilm formation [[cite:PUB00105670]].
