{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MAP3K12 (also known as leucine-zipper protein kinase (ZPK), dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK) or MAPK-upstream kinase (MUK)) is a MAPKKK class protein kinase that induces JNK/SAPK activation. MAP3K12 is known to interact with MUK-binding inhibitory protein (MBIP). MBIP contains two tandem leucine-zipper-like motifs; MBIP interacts with one of the two leucine-zipper-like motifs of MAP3K12 and inhibits the activity of MAP3K12 to induce JNK/SAPK activation [[cite:PUB00044665], [cite:PUB00044666]]. MAP3K12 is autophosphorylated on Ser/Thr in cytosol under basal conditions, and dephosphorylated when membrane-associated.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500741" "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 12", "short" "MAPKKK12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 982, "sets" 0, "proteins" 758, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 433}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
