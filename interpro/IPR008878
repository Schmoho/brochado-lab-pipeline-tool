{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of bacterial proteins found in insertion sequences related to IS66. The function of these proteins is uncertain, but they are probably essential for transposition.</p>\n\n<p>The IS66 family insertion sequence element encodes a DDE transposase TnpC, and two accessory proteins, TnpA and TnpB. It has been assumed that the TnpA, TnpB, and TnpC proteins are produced independently in appropriate amounts and form a complex, which acts as a transposase to promote the transposition of an IS66 family element.TnpB, as the term is used for proteins encoded by IS66 family insertion elements, is considered an accessory protein, since TnpC, encoded by a neighbouring gene, is a DDE family transposase.
