{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are short polypeptides with a conserved GG motif as found in bacteriocins that are cleaved upon export. Each gene occurs immediately upstream of a gene for a peptide-modifying radical SAM/SPASM domain protein. The system is designated Xye for genera Xenorhabdus, Yersinia, and Erwinia, hence XyeA for the precursor peptide. The vicinity will also contain a transport protein with a C39 family peptidase domain ([interpro:IPR005074]), characteristic of GG motif cleave-on-export systems.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04495" "XyeA family cyclophane-containing RiPP triceptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RiPP peptide, XyeA family", "short" "RiPP_XyeA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1090", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1090"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030990", :literature {"PUB00105843" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Ma S" "Chen H" "Li H" "Ji X" "Deng Z" "Ding W" "Zhang Q."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "Post-Translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide-Modifying Radical SAM Enzyme.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "19957-19964", "volume" "60", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34164914}, "PUB00152896" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Nguyen TQN" "Tooh YW" "Sugiyama R" "Nguyen TPD" "Purushothaman M" "Leow LC" "Hanif K" "Yong RHS" "Agatha I" "Winnerdy FR" "Gugger M" "Phan AT" "Morinaka BI."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0519-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Chem", "title" "Post-translational formation of strained cyclophanes in bacteria.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1042-1053", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32807886}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030990", "name" "RiPP peptide, XyeA family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
