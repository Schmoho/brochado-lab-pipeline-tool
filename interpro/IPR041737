{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SoxW is a bacterial periplasmic thioredoxin containing a redox active CXXC motif, encoded by a genetic locus (sox operon) involved in thiosulfate oxidation [[cite:PUB00031606], [cite:PUB00080835]]. Sulfur bacteria oxidize sulfur compounds to provide reducing equivalents for carbon dioxide fixation during autotrophic growth and the respiratory electron transport chain. It is unclear what the role of SoxW is, since it has been found to be dispensable in the oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate. SoxW is specifically kept in the reduced state by SoxV, which is essential in thiosulfate oxidation [[cite:PUB00091767]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02951" "SoxW"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SoxW family", "short" "SoxW"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 487, "taxa" 1808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1982, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1982, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1491}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041737", :literature {"PUB00031606" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 9", "authors" ["Schultz LW" "Chivers PT" "Raines RT."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
