{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RIN4 is an essential regulator of plant defense pathways. It functions with the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase to regulate stomatal apertures, inhibiting the entry of bacterial pathogens during infection [[cite:PUB00090895], [cite:PUB00090896]]. It is required for RPM1-mediated Pseudomonas syringae resistance in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00043291]]. Phosphorylated RIN4 activates the receptor RPM1 to mediate the plant defense [[cite:PUB00090897]]. Arabidopsis RIN4 contains two nitrate-induced (NOI) domains and is a member of the larger NOI family [[cite:PUB00090898]].
