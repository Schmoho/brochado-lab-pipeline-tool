{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LRP5/6 are transmembrane receptors that are involved in Wnt signal transduction [[cite:PUB00077077]]. Binding of the Wnts to LRP5/6 and their participating co-receptors, the frizzled (Fz) family of 7 transmembrane spanning proteins, results in a series of downstream intracelullar events, in particular the inhibition by subsequent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta [[cite:PUB00077078]]. LRP5/6 have been shown to play an role in bone homeostasis [[cite:PUB00077078]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutations in the LRP5 gene cause vitreoretinopathy, exudative 4 (EVR4), a disorder of the retinal vasculature characterised by an abrupt cessation of growth of peripheral capillaries, leading to an avascular peripheral retina [[cite:PUB00077079]]. Mutations in the LRP6 gene cause coronary artery disease, autosomal dominant, 2 (ADCAD2), a common heart disease characterised by reduced or absent blood flow in one or more of the arteries that encircle and supply the heart [[cite:PUB00077080]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036314" "Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, 5/6 types"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6", "short" "LRP5/6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 506, "taxa" 1797, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1379, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1256, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017049", :literature {"PUB00077077" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6803", "authors" ["Tamai K" "Semenov M" "Kato Y" "Spokony R" "Liu C" "Katsuyama Y" "Hess F" "Saint-Jeannet JP" "He X."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35035117", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "LDL-receptor-related proteins in Wnt signal transduction.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "530-5", "volume" "407", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11029007}, "PUB00077080" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5816", "authors" ["Mani A" "Radhakrishnan J" "Wang H" "Mani A" "Mani MA" "Nelson-Williams C" "Carew KS" "Mane S" "Najmabadi H" "Wu D" "Lifton RP."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1136370", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "LRP6 mutation in a family with early coronary disease and metabolic risk factors.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1278-82", "volume" "315", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17332414}, "PUB00077078" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lara-Castillo N" "Johnson ML."], "ISO_journal" "Rev Endocr Metab Disord", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11154-015-9315-2", "medline_journal" "Rev Endocr Metab Disord", "title" "LRP receptor family member associated bone disease.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "141-8", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26048454}, "PUB00077079" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Toomes C" "Bottomley HM" "Jackson RM" "Towns KV" "Scott S" "Mackey DA" "Craig JE" "Jiang L" "Yang Z" "Trembath R" "Woodruff G" "Gregory-Evans CY" "Gregory-Evans K" "Parker MJ" "Black GC" "Downey LM" "Zhang K" "Inglehearn CF."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
