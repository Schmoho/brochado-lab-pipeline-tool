{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of serine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family S10 (clan SC). The type example is carboxypeptidase Y from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) [[cite:PUB00003576]].</p>\n\n<p>All known carboxypeptidases are either metallo carboxypeptidases or serine carboxypeptidases ([ec:3.4.16.5] and [ec:3.4.16.6]). The catalytic activity of the serine carboxypeptidases, like that of the trypsin family serine proteases, is provided by a charge relay system involving an aspartic acid residue hydrogen-bonded to a histidine, which is itself hydrogen-bonded to a serine [[cite:PUB00002615]]. The sequences surrounding the active site serine and histidine residues are highly conserved in all the serine carboxypeptidases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ci9", "name" "Crystal structure of cathepsin A, apo-structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11802" "SERINE PROTEASE FAMILY S10 SERINE CARBOXYPEPTIDASE"}, "prints" {"PR00724" "CRBOXYPTASEC"}, "pfam" {"PF00450" "Serine carboxypeptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S10, serine carboxypeptidase", "short" "Peptidase_S10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 853, "proteomes" 4227, "taxa" 15551, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 65062, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38482}, "pathways" 235}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00122", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00122"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1547", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1547"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
