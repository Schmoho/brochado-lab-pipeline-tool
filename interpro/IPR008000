{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mutarotases are enzymes which interconvert the alpha and beta stereoisomers of monosaccharides, enhancing the rate of their metabolism. Proteins in this entry are homologues of the rhamnose mutarotase YiiL ([swissprot:P32156]) from Escherichia coli, and are often encoded in rhamnose utilisation operons. YiiL is an enzyme which interconverts the alpha and beta stereoisomers of the pyranose form of L-rhamnose [[cite:PUB00020762]]. It is not required for growth on rhamnose, but allows cells to utilise this carbon source more efficiently [[cite:PUB00020761]].The structure of YiiL is distinct from other mutarotases, forming an asymmetric dimer stabilised by an intermolecular Î²-sheet, hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge [[cite:PUB00020761]].</p>\r\n<p>Included in this family is the L-fucose mutarotase from Xanthomonas campestris XCC4070 [[cite:PUB00041539]], but not other L-fucose mutarotases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1x8d", "name" "Crystal structure of E. coli YiiL protein containing L-rhamnose"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05336" "L-rhamnose mutarotase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhamnose/fucose mutarotase", "short" "Rham/fucose_mutarotase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 52, "proteomes" 3497, "taxa" 12914, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15845, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15742, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12098}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0457", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0457"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
