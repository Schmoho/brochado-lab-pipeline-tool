{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transaldolase ([ec:2.2.1.2]) catalyses the reversible transfer of a three-carbon ketol unit from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. This enzyme, together with transketolase, provides a link between the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. Transaldolase is an enzyme of about 34kDa whose sequence has been well conserved throughout evolution. A lysine has been implicated [[cite:PUB00005649]] in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme; it acts as a nucleophilic group that attacks the carbonyl group of fructose-6-phosphate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents transaldolases type 2, which is found in bacteria and plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7bbx", "name" "Neisseria gonorrhoeae transaldolase, variant K8A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00955" "Transaldolase-like proteins from plants and bacteria"}, "hamap" {"MF_00493" "Transaldolase [tal]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036915" "Transaldolase, bacterial/plant type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00876" "transaldolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transaldolase type 2", "short" "Transaldolase_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3073, "taxa" 11054, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13205, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9890}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
