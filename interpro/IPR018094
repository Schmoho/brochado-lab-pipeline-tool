The function of dTMP kinase in eukaryotes comes from the study of a cell cycle mutant, cdc8, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural and functional analyses suggest that the cDNA codes for authentic human dTMP kinase. The mRNA levels and enzyme activities corresponded to cell cycle progression and cell growth stages [[cite:PUB00016913]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4s35", "name" "AMPPCP and TMP bound Crystal structure of thymidylate kinase (aq_969) from Aquifex Aeolicus VF5"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00165" "Thymidylate kinase [tmk]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00041" "dTMP kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thymidylate kinase", "short" "Thymidylate_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 116, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10518, "taxa" 41956, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46726, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46720, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35346}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1621", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1621"} {"accession" "GenProp1617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1617"} {"accession" "GenProp1494", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1494"} {"accession" "GenProp1264", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1264"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
