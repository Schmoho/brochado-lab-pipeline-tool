{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Reovirus nonstructural protein sigma NS exhibits a ssRNA-binding activity and is thought to be involved in assembling the reovirus mRNAs for genome replication and virion morphogenesis. Various studies have been carried out to localize the RNA-binding site [[cite:PUB00003538]]. They suggest that the first 11 amino acids of sigma NS, which are predicted to form an amphipathic Î±-helix, are important for both ssRNA binding and formation of complexes larger than 7-9 S.\r\n<p>A number of other studies have attempted to identify and characterise the RNA-binding activities of sigma NS. A study of the Avian orthoreovirus sigma NS protein suggests that it binds to single-stranded RNA in a nucleotide sequence non-specific manner and is functionally similar to its counterpart specified by mammalian reovirus [[cite:PUB00006226]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01518" "Sigma NS protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Reovirus non-structural protein sigma NS", "short" "Reovirus_polyG_pol"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 125, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 378, "sets" 0, "proteins" 378, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002507", :literature {"PUB00003538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Pattnaik AK" "Hwang L" "Li T" "Englund N" "Mathur M" "Das T" "Banerjee AK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
