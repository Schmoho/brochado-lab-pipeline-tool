{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several plant specific light regulated Lir1 proteins.  Lir1 mRNA accumulates in the light, reaching maximum and minimum steady-state levels at the end of the light and dark period, respectively. Plants germinated in the dark have very low levels of lir1 mRNA, whereas plants germinated in continuous light express lir1 at an intermediate but constant level. It is thought that lir1 expression is controlled by light and a circadian clock [[cite:PUB00013042]]. Lir1 interacts with LEAF-TYPE Ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductase (LFNR), an essential chloroplast enzyme functioning in the last step of photosynthetic linear electron transfer, and forms a thylakoid protein complex with LFNR, TIC62 and TROL [[cite:PUB00087327]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36762" "LIGHT-REGULATED PROTEIN 1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "pfam" {"PF07207" "Light regulated protein Lir1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Light regulated Lir1", "short" "Lir1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 223, "taxa" 896, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 360}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009856", :literature {"PUB00013042" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Reimmann C" "Dudler R."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol.
