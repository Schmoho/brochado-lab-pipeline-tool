{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a set of transcription factors found in some endospore-forming bacteria within the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive bacteria). In some species these proteins are encoded multiple times. The best characterised protein in this entry is the prespore-specific transcription factor RsfA from Bacillus subtilis, previously known as YwfN. Expression of RsfA is controlled by sigma factor F, and it seems to improve the efficiency of sporulation by fine-tuning the expression of genes in the sigma F regulon, particularly the timing of their expression [[cite:PUB00034503]]. It also negatively regulates spoIIR and its own synthesis. A paralog in B. subtilis is designated YlbO, though its function is not known. A highly variable linker region separates two very strongly conserved sequence regions within the protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR41302" "PRESPORE-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATOR RSFA-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02894" "RsfA family transcriptional regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor, RsfA", "short" "DNA_bind_RsfA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 552, "taxa" 1523, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2899, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2899, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2119}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014243", :literature {"PUB00034503" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Juan Wu L" "Errington J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
