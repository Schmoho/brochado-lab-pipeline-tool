{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents AprD4 from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus ([swissprot:Q2MEW6]) and similar sequences from actinomycetes. AprD4 is a radical SAM enzyme involved in C3-deoxygenation of the intermediate paromamine during biosynthesis of the aminoglycoside apramycin. It acts as a diol-dehydratase, and works with the partner protein, AprD3, a reductase [[cite:PUB00083677], [cite:PUB00083678], [cite:PUB00105007]].  Members of this family have a non-canonical CX3CX3C motif for binding of a [4Fe-4S] cluster.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033070" "AprD4 family radical SAM diol-dehydratase"}, "sfld" {"SFLDF00568" "paromamine deoxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Paromamine deoxygenase", "short" "Paromamine_deoxygenase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034533", :literature {"PUB00083677" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kim HJ" "LeVieux J" "Yeh YC" "Liu HW."], "ISO_journal" "Angew.
