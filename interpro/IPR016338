{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents gamma-type phospholipase A2 inhibitors (PLI) found in a variety of snakes, including Elapidae and Viperidae. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2; [ec:3.1.1.4]) is a calcium-dependent enzyme that is involved in inflammatory processes such as the liberation of free arachidonic acid from the membrane pool for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids. Both Elapidae and Viperidae contain PLA2 enzymes in their venoms [[cite:PUB00042881], [cite:PUB00097940]], which can exhibit a wide variety of pharmacological effects including neurotoxicity and myotoxicity. As a result, these snakes must contain PLI in their blood in order to protect themselves from leakage of their own venom PLA2s into the circulatory system. Venomous snakes have three distinct types of PLA2-inhibitory proteins: PLI-alpha, PLI-beta, and PLI-gamma, being PLI-gamma the most abundant ones [[cite:PUB00103664]].</p>\n\n<p>Phospholipase A2 inhibitor CNF, a gamma-type PLI, inhibits the PLA2 activity of crotoxin (CTX) by replacing the acid subunit (CA) in the CTX complex [[cite:PUB00097956]]. It has a proinflammatory action through activation of important main signalling pathways for human leukocytes, in vitro [[cite:PUB00097955]]. In mice phrenic nerve-diaphragm muscle preparations it abolishes both the muscle-paralyzing and muscle-damaging activities of CTX [[cite:PUB00097954]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002023" "Phospholipase A2 inhibitor, alpha/gamma subunits"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phospholipase A2 inhibitor, gamma type", "short" "PLipase_A2-inh_b-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 84, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 60, "sets" 0, "proteins" 60, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 56}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016338", :literature {"PUB00042881" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Shimada A" "Ohkura N" "Hayashi K" "Samejima Y" "Omori-Satoh T" "Inoue S" "Ikeda K."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2007.12.014", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Subunit structure and inhibition specificity of alpha-type phospholipase A2 inhibitor from Protobothrops flavoviridis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "787-96", "volume" "51", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18243268}, "PUB00103664" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Santos-Filho NA" "Santos CT."], "ISO_journal" "J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis", "title" "Alpha-type phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitors from snake blood.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "19", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28344595}, "PUB00097954" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Pinto EKR" "Souza NMV" "Maciel FV" "de Abreu TAG" "Reis HFF" "Ortolani PL" "Fortes-Dias CL" "Cavalcante WLG."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Crotalus Neutralizing Factor (CNF) inhibits the toxic effects of Crotoxin at mouse neuromuscular preparations.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "48-53", "volume" "191", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33387548}, "PUB00097955" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Macedo Tavares MN" "Reis VP" "Alves Rego CM" "Paloschi MV" "Santana HM" "Ferreira E Ferreira AA" "Souza Silva MD" "Setubal SS" "Fortes-Dias CL" "Zuliani JP."], "ISO_journal" "Immunobiology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Immunobiology", "title" "Crotalus neutralising factor and its role in human leukocyte modulation.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "151932", "volume" "225", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32183984}, "PUB00097956" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Fortes-Dias CL" "Fonseca BC" "Kochva E" "Diniz CR."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Purification and properties of an antivenom factor from the plasma of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus).", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "997-1008", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1949070}, "PUB00097940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Shirai R" "Toriba M" "Hayashi K" "Ikeda K" "Inoue S."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Identification and characterization of phospholipase A2 inhibitors from the serum of the Japanese rat snake, Elaphe climacophora.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "685-92", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19673083}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019834", "name" "phospholipase A2 inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0032429", "name" "regulation of phospholipase A2 activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016338", "name" "Phospholipase A2 inhibitor, gamma type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
