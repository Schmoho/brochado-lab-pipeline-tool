{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Multicopper oxidase LPR1 and LPR2 are involved in copper homeostasis and oxidative stress response, particularly in the context of root growth and inorganic phosphate homeostasis in plants. Members of the family function in a common pathway that modulates root meristem activity in response to phosphate availability [[cite:PUB00155257], [cite:PUB00155258]]. LPR1 may contribute to the oxidative stress response by oxidizing various substrates, as shown with 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) in vitro, suggesting a broader role in plant metabolism and environmental stress adaptation [[cite:PUB00155257]]. LPR1 is involved in the regulation of the auxin response to Pi starvation and function in opposite ways in regulating the root growth response to Pi starvation in the endoplasmic reticulum compared to LPR2 [[cite:PUB00155259]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48461" "MULTICOPPER OXIDASE LPR1-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Multicopper oxidase LPR1/LPR2", "short" "LPR1/LPR2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 235, "taxa" 966, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1012, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1012, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 569}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052152", :literature {"PUB00155259" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wang X" "Du G" "Wang X" "Meng Y" "Li Y" "Wu P" "Yi K."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcq004", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "The function of LPR1 is controlled by an element in the promoter and is independent of SUMO E3 Ligase SIZ1 in response to low Pi stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "380-94", "volume" "51", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20071375}, "PUB00155257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Svistoonoff S" "Creff A" "Reymond M" "Sigoillot-Claude C" "Ricaud L" "Blanchet A" "Nussaume L" "Desnos T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Genet", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ng2041", "medline_journal" "Nat Genet", "title" "Root tip contact with low-phosphate media reprograms plant root architecture.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "792-6", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17496893}, "PUB00155258" {"URL" nil, "issue" "33", "authors" ["Ticconi CA" "Lucero RD" "Sakhonwasee S" "Adamson AW" "Creff A" "Nussaume L" "Desnos T" "Abel S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0901778106", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "ER-resident proteins PDR2 and LPR1 mediate the developmental response of root meristems to phosphate availability.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "14174-9", "volume" "106", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19666499}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016491", "name" "oxidoreductase activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016036", "name" "cellular response to phosphate starvation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR052152", "name" "Multicopper oxidase LPR1/LPR2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
