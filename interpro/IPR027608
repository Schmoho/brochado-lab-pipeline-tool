{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This three-domain protein is restricted to the spirochetes and widely distributed (excepting Borrelia). It has a conserved C-terminal SPASM domain, a 4Fe-4S binding domain shared by a number of peptide-modifying and heme-modifying radical SAM proteins. It has a central radical SAM domain, although half the members have lost the signature 4Fe-4S-binding Cys residues, fail to register with the radical SAM domain definition of model in entry [interpro:IPR007197], and must be considered pseudo-SAM proteins. PSI-BLAST shows a relationship between the N-terminal domain and various predicted glycosyltransferases (e.g. Bacillus subtilis SpsF) and cytidyltransferases. In some Treponema species, this protein appears to split into two tandem genes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04321" "spiro-SPASM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spirochetes SPASM protein", "short" "Spiro_SPASM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 51, "taxa" 352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 342, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 274}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027608", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027608", "name" "Spirochetes SPASM protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
