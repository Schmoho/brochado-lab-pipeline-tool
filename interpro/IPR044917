{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PRIMPOL has both DNA polymerase and DNA/RNA primase activities. It is involved in downstream repriming of stalled forks during both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. It pays an important part in DNA damage tolerance [[cite:PUB00097590]]. It is predicted to possess an archaeo-eukaryotic primase and a UL52-like zinc finger domain [[cite:PUB00097587], [cite:PUB00097588]]. The primase activity of PRIMPOL is essential for many functions in the nucleus. However, the role of PRIMPOL polymerase activity is still unclear, as PRIMPOL synthesizes DNA with limited processivity, rarely incorporating more than four nucleotides on an undamaged template [[cite:PUB00097589]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31399" "DNA-DIRECTED PRIMASE / POLYMERASE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed primase/polymerase protein", "short" "PRIMPOL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1158, "taxa" 4610, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2909, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2909, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1916}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
