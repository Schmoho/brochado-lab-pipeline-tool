{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes TCRG1/TCRGL from human and related proteins from animals, fungi and plants. TCRG1 (also known as CA150) contains three N-terminal WW domains and six consecutive FF domains. WW and FF domains are versatile modules that mediate protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00098135]]. TCRG1 is a transcription elongation factor that interacts with the splicing factor SF1 and with the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) through its WW and FF domains, respectively [[cite:PUB00098134]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes dre4 from fission yeast, URN1 from budding yeast and PRP40C from Arabidopsis. They are predicted to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00063299], [cite:PUB00057210]]. The plant PRP40C binds the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and its two WW domains were shown to mediate this interaction [[cite:PUB00063299]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4fqg", "name" "Crystal structure of the TCERG1 FF4-6 tandem repeat domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15377" "TRANSCRIPTION ELONGATION REGULATOR 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription elongation regulator 1-like", "short" "TCRG1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2115, "taxa" 7392, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5749, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5749, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3419}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045148", :literature {"PUB00057210" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ren L" "McLean JR" "Hazbun TR" "Fields S" "Vander Kooi C" "Ohi MD" "Gould KL."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016719", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Systematic two-hybrid and comparative proteomic analyses reveal novel yeast pre-mRNA splicing factors connected to Prp19.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e16719", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21386897}, "PUB00063299" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kang CH" "Feng Y" "Vikram M" "Jeong IS" "Lee JR" "Bahk JD" "Yun DJ" "Lee SY" "Koiwa H."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
