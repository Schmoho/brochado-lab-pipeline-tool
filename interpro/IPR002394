{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate signal transduction at the post-synaptic membrane of cholinergic synapses, such as the neuromuscular junction [[cite:PUB00002675]]. They belong to a family of neurotransmitter-gated receptors, including glycine, gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA), serotonin 5HT3 receptors. These are oligomeric transmembrane (TM) complexes (pentamers of 2 alpha and 1 beta, 1 gamma and 1 delta subunit) that contain a central channel, which transiently opens upon binding of a specific neurotransmitters. Their sequences are related and share the same topology: each has an extracellular, glycosylated N-terminal ligand-binding domain; 3 hydrophobic TM regions, which form the channel; a hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain; followed by a fourth putative TM region [[cite:PUB00003060]]. The nicotinic receptor ligand binding domain is a specialised pocket of aromatic and hydrophobic residues formed at interfaces between protein subunits that changes conformation to convert agonist binding into gating of an intrinsic ion channel [[cite:PUB00009775]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Neurotransmitter ligand-gated ion channels are transmembrane receptor-ion channel complexes that open transiently upon binding of specific ligands, allowing rapid transmission of signals at chemical synapses [[cite:PUB00002675], [cite:PUB00003455]].
