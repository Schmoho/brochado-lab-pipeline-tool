{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes DCC1 (thioredoxin DXXCXXC motif-containing protein 1, AT5G50100) from Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00096851]], which belongs to the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase family. Members of this family contain a conserved DxxCxxC motif in their N-terminal. Two Cys residues present in this motif determined the function of these proteins as Thioredoxins (Trxs), key enzymes for modulating ROS scavenging through the reduction of specific S-S groups. DCC1 is localised in mitochondria and directly interacts with CARBONIC ANHYDRASE2 (CA2), an essential subunit of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I). DCC1 catalyses a redox modification on CA2, resulting in the regulation of Complex I activity and ROS homeostasis which is important for de novo shoot initiation and improvement the capacity of plant regeneration [[cite:PUB00096851]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised proteins from bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34290" "SI:CH73-390P7.2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin DCC1", "short" "DCC1_Trx"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1422, "taxa" 6766, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5562, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5562, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4092}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044691", :literature {"PUB00096851" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Zhang H" "Zhang TT" "Liu H" "Shi Y" "Wang M" "Bie XM" "Li XG" "Zhang XS."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Thioredoxin-Mediated ROS Homeostasis Explains Natural Variation in Plant Regeneration.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "2231-2250", "volume" "176", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28724620}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015035", "name" "protein-disulfide reductase activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007263", "name" "DCC1-like thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044691", "name" "Thioredoxin DCC1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
