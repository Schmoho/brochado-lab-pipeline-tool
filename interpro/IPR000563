{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many flagellar proteins are exported by a flagellum-specific export pathway. Attempts have been made to characterise the apparatus responsible for this process, by designing assays to screen for mutants with export defects. Experiments involving filament removal from temperature-sensitive flagellar mutants of Salmonella typhimurium have shown that, while most mutants were able to regrow filaments, flhA, fliH, fliI and fliN mutants showed no or greatly reduced regrowth. This suggests that the corresponding gene products are involved in the process of flagellum-specific export [[cite:PUB00002143]]. The sequence of fliH has been deduced and shown to encode a protein of molecular mass of 25,782 Da.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01003" "FLGFLIH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar assembly protein FliH", "short" "Flag_FliH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1093, "taxa" 5673, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31326, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5843, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4538}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000563", :literature {"PUB00002143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Vogler AP" "Homma M" "Irikura VM" "Macnab RM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
