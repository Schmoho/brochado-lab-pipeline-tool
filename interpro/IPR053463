{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of small proteins mainly from Halobacteria including Transcriptional regulator Brz. Brz is known to activate transcription of bacteriorhodopsin and phytoene synthase. It may interact with DNA or RNA via the zinc finger domain [[cite:PUB00152929]]. These proteins are predicted to adopt a zinc β-ribbon fold in which the last zinc coordinating residue is histidine instead of the commonly found cysteine. This kind of substitution has been already observed in other zinc β-ribbon domains from transcription factors, methytransferases and ribosomal proteins. Mutation of the cysteine and histidine residues has a pronounced effect on the Brz function [[cite:PUB00152929]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23454" "Transcriptional regulator Brz zinc beta ribbon domain"}, "ncbifam" {"NF041795" "transcriptional regulator Brz"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Brz Transcriptional Regulator", "short" "Brz_Regulator"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 73, "sets" 0, "proteins" 73, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 61}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053463", :literature {"PUB00152929" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Tarasov VY" "Besir H" "Schwaiger R" "Klee K" "Furtwangler K" "Pfeiffer F" "Oesterhelt D."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.06081.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "A small protein from the bop-brp intergenic region of Halobacterium salinarum contains a zinc finger motif and regulates bop and crtB1 transcription.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "772-80", "volume" "67", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18179416}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053463", "name" "Brz Transcriptional Regulator", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 18}}}
