{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Caveolae are 50-100 nm invaginations located at the plasma membrane of many cell types and are known to transport molecules across endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00074862]]. Caveolae require the caveolin protein for formation. Caveolins may act as scaffolding proteins within caveolar membranes by compartmentalizing and concentrating signalling molecules. Mammals have three caveolin proteins:caveolin-1 (Cav-1, or VIP21), caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 (or M-caveolin). Various classes of signalling molecules, including G-protein subunits, receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and small GTPases, bind Cav-1 through its 'caveolin-scaffolding domain' [[cite:PUB00074863]].</p>\n\n<p>Caveolins are proteins of about 20 Kd, they form high molecular mass homo-oligomers. Structurally they seem to have N-terminal and C-terminal hydrophilic segments and a long central transmembrane domain that probably forms a hairpin in the membrane. Both extremities are known to face the cytoplasm. Caveolae are enriched with cholesterol and Cav-1 is one of the few proteins that binds cholesterol tightly and specifically.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01146" "Caveolin"}, "panther" {"PTHR10844" "CAVEOLIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Caveolin", "short" "Caveolin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 913, "taxa" 3411, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4016, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3963, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2588}, "pathways" 120}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00930", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00930"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001612", :literature {"PUB00074862" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Anderson RG."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
