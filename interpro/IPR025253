{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the Ldr (long direct repeat) toxins. In Escherichia coli there are four Ldr toxins, LdrA, LdrB, LdrC and LdrD. These toxins inhibit cell growth, decrease cell viability and cause nucleoid condensation. They are part of the type I toxin antitoxin (TA) system, where expression of the proteinaceous toxin is controlled by an antisense sRNA. For example, LdrD expression is inhibited by the antisense RNA RdlD, which functions as an antitoxin [[cite:PUB00057321]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13940" "Toxin Ldr, type I toxin-antitoxin system"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type I toxin-antitoxin system, toxin Ldr", "short" "Toxin_Ldr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 454, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1057, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 823}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1091", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1091"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025253", :literature {"PUB00057321" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kawano M" "Oshima T" "Kasai H" "Mori H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
