{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Urease (urea amidohydrolase, [ec:3.5.1.5]) is a nickel-binding enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate [[cite:PUB00001363]]. It is mainly found in plant seeds, microorganisms and invertebrates. In plants, urease is a hexamer of identical chains, but the subunit composition of urease from different sources varies [[cite:PUB00010725]], in bacteria [[cite:PUB00003605]] it consists of either two or three different subunits (alpha, beta and gamma).</p>\n\n<p>Urease binds two nickel ions per subunit; four histidine, an aspartate and a carbamated-lysine serve as ligands to these metals; an additional histidine is involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00005206]]. The urease domain forms an (alpha Î²)(8) barrel structure with structural similarity to other metal-dependent hydrolases, such as adenosine and AMP deaminase and phosphotriesterase. Urease is unique among nickel metalloenzymes in that it catalyses a hydrolysis rather than a redox reaction.</p>\n\n<p>The orthologous protein is known as the alpha subunit (ureC) in most other bacteria.In Helicobacter pylori, the gamma and beta domains are fused and called the alpha subunit ([interpro:IPR008223]). The catalytic subunit (called beta or B) has the same organisation as the Klebsiella alpha subunit. Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease has a fused gamma-beta-alpha organisation ([interpro:IPR008221]). This entry describes the urease alpha subunit UreC (designated beta or B chain, UreB in Helicobacter species).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ol4", "name" "1.28 A resolution of Sporosarcina pasteurii urease inhibited in the presence of NBPT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011059", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase, composite domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00375" "Urease_alpha"}, "hamap" {"MF_01953" "Urease subunit alpha [ureC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01792" "urease subunit alpha"}, "prints" {"PR01752" "UREASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urease, alpha subunit", "short" "Urease_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 81, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4885, "taxa" 18313, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23837, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14930}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00133", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00133"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0051", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0051"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
