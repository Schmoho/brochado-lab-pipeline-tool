{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of pre-mRNA-processing factors, including Syf1/Clf1 from budding yeasts and protein crooked neck (CRN) from fruit flies. Syf1 acts as a component of the NTC complex (or Prp19-associated complex), associates to the spliceosome to mediate conformational rearrangement or to stabilize the structure of the spliceosome after U4 snRNA dissociation, which leads to spliceosome maturation [[cite:PUB00017141], [cite:PUB00097990]]. Clf1 is a splicing factor that are part of at least two multisubunit protein complexes, a small nuclear RNA-free structure similar to what was reported as the Prp19 complex and an RNP structure that contains the U2, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNAs [[cite:PUB00077957]]. Human CRN-like protein is also implicated in pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00097992]]. The crn mutation in Drosophila has been shown to cause abnormalities in the central and peripheral nervous systems [[cite:PUB00097991]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011990", "name" "Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11246" "PRE-MRNA SPLICING FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor Syf1-like", "short" "Syf1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 92, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2703, "taxa" 9259, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14930, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14930, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9521}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045075", :literature {"PUB00077957" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Wang Q" "Hobbs K" "Lynn B" "Rymond BC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
