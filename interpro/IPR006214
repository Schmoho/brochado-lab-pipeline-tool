{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) [[cite:PUB00001966]] is a suppressor of apoptosis that interacts with BCL2 and  BCL-X. Human Bax BI-1 is an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein containing multiple membrane-spanning segments localised to the ER membrane. It has 6-7 membrane-spanning domains. The C termini of the mammalian BI-1 proteins are comprised of basic amino acids resembling some nuclear targeting sequences, but otherwise the predicted proteins lack motifs that suggest this function. BI-1 also regulates cell death triggered by ER stress [[cite:PUB00053809], [cite:PUB00098575], [cite:PUB00098576]]. BI-1 appears to exert its effect through an interaction with calmodulin [[cite:PUB00053810]]. Crystal structure of a bacterial member reveals that these proteins mediate a calcium leak across the membrane in a pH-dependent manner. Calcium homoeostasis balances passive calcium leak with active calcium uptake. The structure exists in a pore-closed and pore-open conformation, at pHs of 8 and 6 respectively [[cite:PUB00098576], [cite:PUB00095242]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents BI-1 and related sequences, including lifeguard proteins, which resemble BI-1 and also act as apoptotic regulators [[cite:PUB00098575]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4pgr", "name" "Crystal structure of YetJ from Bacillus Subtilis at pH 8"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01027" "Inhibitor of apoptosis-promoting Bax1"}, "panther" {"PTHR23291" "BAX INHIBITOR-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bax inhibitor 1-related", "short" "Bax_inhibitor_1-related"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 262, "proteomes" 7438, "taxa" 30477, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44346, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44133, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31448}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006214", :literature {"PUB00053810" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Watanabe N" "Lam E."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms10073149", "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Bax inhibitor-1, a conserved cell death suppressor, is a key molecular switch downstream from a variety of biotic and abiotic stress signals in plants.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3149-67", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19742129}, "PUB00053809" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Watanabe N" "Lam E."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "title" "Arabidopsis Bax inhibitor-1: A rheostat for ER stress-induced programmed cell death.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "564-6", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19704470}, "PUB00001966" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Walter L" "Marynen P" "Szpirer J" "Levan G" "Gunther E."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.1995.1145", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Identification of a novel conserved human gene, TEGT.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "301-4", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8530040}, "PUB00098576" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bultynck G" "Kiviluoto S" "Henke N" "Ivanova H" "Schneider L" "Rybalchenko V" "Luyten T" "Nuyts K" "De Borggraeve W" "Bezprozvanny I" "Parys JB" "De Smedt H" "Missiaen L" "Methner A."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The C terminus of Bax inhibitor-1 forms a Ca2+-permeable channel pore.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "2544-57", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22128171}, "PUB00098575" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Weis C" "Huckelhoven R" "Eichmann R."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "LIFEGUARD proteins support plant colonization by biotrophic powdery mildew fungi.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "3855-67", "volume" "64", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23888068}, "PUB00095242" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6188", "authors" ["Chang Y" "Bruni R" "Kloss B" "Assur Z" "Kloppmann E" "Rost B" "Hendrickson WA" "Liu Q."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structural basis for a pH-sensitive calcium leak across membranes.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1131-5", "volume" "344", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24904158}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006214", "name" "Bax inhibitor 1-related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 249, "alignment:full" 16354}}}
