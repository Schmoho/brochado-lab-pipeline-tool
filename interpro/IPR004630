{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of uncharacterised multi-pass membrane proteins, which are found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, such as YeiH from E. coli. Members of this family are found so far only in one archaeal species, Archaeoglobus fulgidus. These proteins have a molecular weight of approximately 35 to 38kDa and may be associated to sulfate export transporter function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00698" "YeiH family putative sulfate export transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UPF0324 inner membrane protein YeiH-like", "short" "UPF0324_YeiH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 591, "taxa" 3847, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3728, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3728, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2845}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004630", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018383", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0324, prokaryote", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004630", "name" "UPF0324 inner membrane protein YeiH-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
