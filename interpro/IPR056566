{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes LnsB and related bacterial proteins from the CPBP family. LnsB is involved in a two-protein system for the N-acylation of lipoproteins. It belongs to the CPBP family of Rce1-like glutamic-type intramembrane proteases, which includes the type II CAAX prenyl proteases in eukaryotes and the myxosortases in prokaryotes. However, the typical active site-containing motif, EExxxR, is disrupted in most members of this family, suggesting a loss of endopeptidase activity. The partner protein in this system, LnsA, has some similarities with members of the NlpC/P60 superfamily [[cite:PUB00152898]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041768" "CPBP family lipoprotein N-acylation protein LnsB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CPBP family lipoprotein N-acylation protein LnsB-like", "short" "Acyl_LnsB_CPBP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 64, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 73, "sets" 0, "proteins" 73, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 52}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056566", :literature {"PUB00152898" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Gardiner JH 4th" "Komazin G" "Matsuo M" "Cole K" "Gotz F" "Meredith TC."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01619-20", "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Lipoprotein N-Acylation in Staphylococcus aureus Is Catalyzed by a Two-Component Acyl Transferase System.
