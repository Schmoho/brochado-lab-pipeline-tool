{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The HutP protein regulates the expression of Bacillus 'hut' structural genes by an anti-termination complex, which recognises three UAG triplet units, separated by four non-conserved nucleotides on the RNA terminator region. L-Histidine and Mg2+ ions are also required. These proteins exhibit the structural elements of alpha/beta proteins, arranged in the order: α-α-β-α-α-β-β-β in the primary structure, and the four antiparallel β-strands form a β-sheet in the order beta1-beta2-beta3-beta4, with two α-helices each on the front (alpha1 and alpha2) and at the back (alpha3 and alpha4) of the β-sheet [[cite:PUB00032271]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wpu", "name" "Crystal Structure of the HutP antitermination complex bound to a single stranded region of hut mRNA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036482", "name" "Hut operon regulatory protein HutP superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00779" "Hut operon positive regulatory protein [hutP]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hut operon regulatory protein HutP, bacillales", "short" "Regulatory_HutP_bacillales"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 66, "taxa" 383, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 335, "sets" 0, "proteins" 335, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 232}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023552", :literature {"PUB00032271" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7030", "authors" ["Kumarevel T" "Mizuno H" "Kumar PK."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03355", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structural basis of HutP-mediated anti-termination and roles of the Mg2+ ion and L-histidine ligand.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "183-91", "volume" "434", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15758992}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015111", "name" "Hut operon regulatory protein HutP", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023552", "name" "Hut operon regulatory protein HutP, bacillales", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
