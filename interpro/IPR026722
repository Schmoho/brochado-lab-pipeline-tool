{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes NYAP1 and NYAP2 from neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor for the PI 3-kinase (NYAP) family (consists of NYAP1, NYAP2, NAP3/Myosin16).  NYAPs activate PI3K in PI3K pathway, which is a fundamental pathway for various cellular events in neurons. They also interact with components of the WAVE1 complex, which mediates actin cytoskeleton remodeling through Arp2/3 complex. \r\nIt was suggested that NYAPs connect PI3K activation to WAVE1 signalling in neurons\r\n[[cite:PUB00061705]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22633" "NEURONAL TYROSINE-PHOSPHORYLATED PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-3-KINASE ADAPTER 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphoinositide-3-kinase adapter 1/2", "short" "NYAP1/NYAP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 606, "taxa" 2066, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1817, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1817, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1146}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026722", :literature {"PUB00061705" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Yokoyama K" "Tezuka T" "Kotani M" "Nakazawa T" "Hoshina N" "Shimoda Y" "Kakuta S" "Sudo K" "Watanabe K" "Iwakura Y" "Yamamoto T."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.348", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "NYAP: a phosphoprotein family that links PI3K to WAVE1 signalling in neurons.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "4739-54", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21946561}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0043491", "name" "phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0048812", "name" "neuron projection morphogenesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026722", "name" "Neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphoinositide-3-kinase adapter 1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
