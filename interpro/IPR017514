{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The H protein (GcvH) of the glycine cleavage system shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P protein to the T protein. Most Chlamydia lack the P and T proteins, and have a single homologue of GcvH that appears deeply split from canonical GcvH in molecular phylogenetic trees. This protein family represents the Chlamydial GcvH homologue, which is always seen as part of a two-gene operon, downstream of a member of the uncharacterised protein family [interpro:IPR017513].
