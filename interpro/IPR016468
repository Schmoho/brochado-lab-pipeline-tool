{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein.CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. They regulate cell differentiation, growth, survival, and inflammation [[cite:PUB00029248]]. They function in a variety of tissues. The prototypic C/EBP is a modular protein, consisting of an activation domain, a dimerization bZIP region, and a DNA-binding domain. All family members share the highly conserved dimerization domain, required for DNA binding, by which they form homo- and heterodimers with other family members. The least conserved parts of C/EBPs are the activation domains which vary from strong activators to dominant negative repressors [[cite:PUB00044093]].</p>\n\n<p>C/EBPs have been found to promote the terminal differentiation of adipocytes. During the normal course of adipogenesis, C/EBP expression is restricted to a terminal phase when growth is paused and specialised cell phenotypes emerge. Since C/EBP is expressed in a variety of tissues, it may have a fundamental role in regulating the balance between cell growth and differentiation in higher animals [[cite:PUB00044094]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005879" "CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, chordates", "short" "C/EBP_chordates"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 569, "taxa" 1982, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1576, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1132}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016468", :literature {"PUB00029248" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Miller M" "Shuman JD" "Sebastian T" "Dauter Z" "Johnson PF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
