{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase CRTE (GGPPS) is an enzyme that catalyses the condensation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to yield geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) [[cite:PUB00154610]]. This reaction is crucial for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and diterpenes. The enzyme belongs to the FPP/GGPP synthase family and is found in various organisms, including Cyanophora paradoxa and Picosynechococcus sp. (strain ATCC 27264 / PCC 7002 / PR-6). In Picosynechococcus sp., GGPPS catalyzes the sequential condensation of three molecules of IPP onto dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to yield GGPP, playing a key role in the biosynthesis of terpenenoids [[cite:PUB00154610]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Dimethylallyltranstransferase AmbP2 from Fischerella ambigua, a prenyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of ambiguines, a family of hapalindole-type alkaloids [[cite:PUB00100305]]. It catalyses the addition of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) onto dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to form geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) [[cite:PUB00100305]], however, it cannot use farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) [[cite:PUB00100305]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7my0", "name" "Sy-CrtE IPP structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008949", "name" "Isoprenoid synthase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045685" "geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase CrtE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase CRTE-like", "short" "GGPPSyn_CRT-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 225, "taxa" 1355, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 778, "sets" 0, "proteins" 778, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 547}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
