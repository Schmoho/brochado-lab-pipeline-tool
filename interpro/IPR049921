{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Type 4 apparatus protein DotM ([swissprot:Q5ZYC7]) from Legionella pneumophila and similar proteins mainly from gammaproteobacteria. DotM is a component of the Dot/Icm type 4B secretion system (T4BSS), which is used to inject bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells [[cite:PUB00136017], [cite:PUB00153335], [cite:PUB00100787]]. The T4BS systems are encoded by a large gene cluster named dot/icm. Three components of this system, DotL, DotM, and DotN, form the \"coupling complex\", which serves as a platform for recruitment of effector proteins [[cite:PUB00153335], [cite:PUB00100787]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of DotM was determined as a part of the membrane-embedded T4 coupling complex (T4CC). The T4CC includes the DotL ATPase, the DotM and DotN proteins, the chaperone module IcmSW, and DotY and DotZ proteins ([pdbe:6SZ9]) [[cite:PUB00100787]]. In the T4CC complex, DotLMNYZ form hetero-pentameric core from which the flexible IcmSW module protrudes [[cite:PUB00100787]]. DotM forms the interacting surface for recruitment of acidic Glu-rich motif-containing effectors [[cite:PUB00105402]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5x1u", "name" "Structure of the cytosolic domain of DotM derived from Legionella pneumophila"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033890" "type IVB secretion system coupling complex protein DotM/IcmP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type 4 apparatus protein DotM-llike", "short" "DotM-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 40, "taxa" 170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 197, "sets" 0, "proteins" 197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 169}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049921", :literature {"PUB00100787" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Meir A" "Mace K" "Lukoyanova N" "Chetrit D" "Hospenthal MK" "Redzej A" "Roy C" "Waksman G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Mechanism of effector capture and delivery by the type IV secretion system from Legionella pneumophila.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "2864", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32513920}, "PUB00153335" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Vincent CD" "Friedman JR" "Jeong KC" "Sutherland MC" "Vogel JP."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2012.08118.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Identification of the DotL coupling protein subcomplex of the Legionella Dot/Icm type IV secretion system.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "378-91", "volume" "85", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22694730}, "PUB00105402" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Meir A" "Chetrit D" "Liu L" "Roy CR" "Waksman G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Legionella DotM structure reveals a role in effector recruiting to the Type 4B secretion system.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "507", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29410427}, "PUB00136017" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Vincent CD" "Friedman JR" "Jeong KC" "Buford EC" "Miller JL" "Vogel JP."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Identification of the core transmembrane complex of the Legionella Dot/Icm type IV secretion system.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1278-91", "volume" "62", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17040490}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049921", "name" "Type 4 apparatus protein DotM-llike", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
