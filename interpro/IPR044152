{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of NADPH dehydrogenases, including NamA (also known as YqjM) from Bacillus subtilis. YqjM is a member of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family of flavin oxidoreductases. Similar to other OYE members, YqjM binds the FMN cofactor non-covalently and reduces the flavin in the reductive half-reaction at the expense of NADPH. It transfers electrons from the reduced flavin to the double bond of a variety of alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and accepts also electrophilic xenobiotics such as nitroglycerin, N-ethylmaleimide, and trinitrotoluene as substrates for the oxidative half-reaction [[cite:PUB00095202], [cite:PUB00038735]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes AfvA from Aspergillus flavus. AfvA is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of aflavarin, a bicoumarin that exhibits anti-insectan activity against the fungivorous beetle C.hemipterus [[cite:PUB00095203]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3l5l", "name" "Xenobiotic Reductase A - oxidized"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02932" "OYE_YqiM_FMN"}, "panther" {"PTHR43303" "NADPH DEHYDROGENASE C23G7.10C-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADPH dehydrogenase YqjM-like", "short" "YqjM-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 52, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5704, "taxa" 20300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29416, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29412, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21877}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
