{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>During N-linked glycosylation of proteins, oligosaccharide chains are assembled on the carrier molecule dolichyl pyrophosphate in the following order: 2 molecules of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), 9 molecules of mannose, and 3 molecules of glucose. These 14-residue oligosaccharide cores are then transferred to asparagine residues on nascent polypeptide chains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As proteins progress through the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharide cores are modified by trimming and extension to generate a diverse array of glycosylated proteins [[cite:PUB00054185], [cite:PUB00020140]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oligosaccharyl transferase complex (OST complex) [ec:2.4.1.119] transfers  14-sugar branched oligosaccharides from dolichyl pyrophosphate to asparagine residues [[cite:PUB00008612]]. The complex contains nine protein subunits: Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Swp1p, and Wbp1p, all of which are integral membrane proteins of the ER. The OST complex interacts with the Sec61p pore complex [[cite:PUB00054184]] involved in protein import into the ER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents subunits OST3 and OST6. OST3 is homologous to OST6 [[cite:PUB00008613]], and several lines of evidence indicate that they are alternative members of the OST complex. Disruption of both OST3 and OST6 causes severe underglycosylation of soluble and membrane-bound glycoproteins and a defect in the assembly of the complex. Hence, the function of these genes seems to be essential for recruiting a fully active complex necessary for efficient N-glycosylation [[cite:PUB00008613]]. This entry also includes the magnesium transporter protein 1, also known as OST3 homologue B, which might be involved in N-glycosylation through its association with the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4m91", "name" "crystal structure of hN33/Tusc3-peptide 1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04756" "OST3 / OST6 family, transporter family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12692" "DOLICHYL-DIPHOSPHOOLIGOSACCHARIDE--PROTEIN GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oligosaccharyl transferase complex, subunit OST3/OST6", "short" "OligosaccharylTrfase_OST3/OST6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 96, "proteomes" 2584, "taxa" 8920, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8262, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5414}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021149", :literature {"PUB00054184" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Chavan M" "Yan A" "Lennarz WJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
