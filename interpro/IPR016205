{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents two distinct enzymes: bacterial NAD-linked glycerol dehydrogenase and archaeal glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase is responsible for the formation of the archaeal-specific glycerophosphate backbone of phospholipids, G-1-P, from glycerone phosphate [[cite:PUB00043531]].
