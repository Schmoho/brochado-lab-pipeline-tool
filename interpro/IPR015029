{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes Monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin synthase PrnB from Pseudomonas fluorescens and similar bacterial proteins. PrnB is involved in the biosynthesis of the antifungal compound pyrrolnitrin. It is organised into two domains: a small N-terminal capping domain that consists of 7 Î±-helices and the core helical domain, which is related to myoglobin. PrnB shows structural homology to the heme b-dependent two-domain indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme (IDO) and to the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) family [[cite:PUB00049615], [cite:PUB00054440]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v7k", "name" "PrnB D-tryptophan complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037217", "name" "Tryptophan/Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08933" "Monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin synthase PrnB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Monodechloroaminopyrrolnitrin synthase PrnB", "short" "PrnB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 145, "taxa" 825, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 587, "sets" 0, "proteins" 585, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 406}, "pathways" 52}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
