{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycoside hydrolase family 24 [cazy:GH24] comprises enzymes with only one known activity; lysozyme ([ec:3.2.1.17]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry includes Bacteriophage lambda lysozyme and Escherichia coli endolysin [[cite:PUB00003216]]. Lysozyme helps to release mature phage particles from the cell wall by breaking down the peptidoglycan. The enzyme hydrolyses the 1,4-beta linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid in peptidoglycan heteropolymers of prokaryotic cell walls. E. coli endolysin also functions in bacterial cell lysis and acts as a transglycosylase.   The Bacteriophage T4 lysozyme structure contains two domains, the interface between which forms the active-site cleft. The N terminus of the two domains undergoes a 'hinge-bending' motion about an axis passing through the molecular waist [[cite:PUB00003216], [cite:PUB00004082]]. This mobility is thought to be important in allowing access of substrates to the enzyme active site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>O-Glycosyl hydrolases ([ec:3.2.1.]) are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety.
