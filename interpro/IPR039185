{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3) from mammals, also known as ADPN (adiponutrin) or iPLA2-epsilon (calcium-independent phospholipase A2). PNPLA3 is a triacylglycerol lipase that mediates triacylglycerol hydrolysis in adipocytes and is an indicator of the nutritional state. Human adiponutrins are bound to the cell membrane of adipocytes and show transacylase, TG hydrolase, and PLA2 activity [[cite:PUB00081593], [cite:PUB00081594], [cite:PUB00089252]]. In murine models, PNPLA3 was found to be involved in the hepatic metabolism of triglycerides and in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis [[cite:PUB00089253]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016035", "name" "Acyl transferase/acyl hydrolase/lysophospholipase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07221" "Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase PNPLA3", "short" "Pat_PNPLA3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 64, "sets" 0, "proteins" 64, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 37}, "pathways" 31}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
