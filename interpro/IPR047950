{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cis-biphenyl-2,3-dihydrodiol-2,3-dehydrogenase (BphB) is a classical SDR of particular importance for its role in the degradation of biphenyl/polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs); PCBs are a significant source of environmental contamination [[cite:PUB00118293]]. This entry also includes Pseudomonas putida F1 cis-biphenyl-1,2-dihydrodiol-1,2-dehydrogenase (also known as cis-benzene glycol dehydrogenase, encoded by the bnzE gene), which participates in benzene metabolism. In addition, it includes Pseudomonas sp. C18 putative 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene dehydrogenase which participates in an upper naphthalene catabolic pathway.</p>\n\n<p>SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns [[cite:PUB00027779], [cite:PUB00027780], [cite:PUB00000419], [cite:PUB00081091], [cite:PUB00081093]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1bdb", "name" "CIS-BIPHENYL-2,3-DIHYDRODIOL-2,3-DEHYDROGENASE FROM PSEUDOMONAS SP.
