{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family represents a group of Ntn-hydrolases from all cellular organisms that belong to the MEROPS peptidase family T2 (clan PB(T)). Members of this entry include glycosylasparaginases ([ec:3.5.1.26]), which are threonine peptidases, and L-asparaginases ([ec:3.5.1.1]).</p>\n\n<p>Glycosylasparaginases are characterised by a threonine nucleophile at the N terminus of the mature enzyme. They catalyse:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>N4-(beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-L-asparagine + H(2)O = N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminylamine + L-aspartate</reaction></p>\n\n<p>It cleaves the GlcNAc-Asn bond that links oligosaccharides to asparagine in N-linked glycoproteins. The enzyme is composed of two non-identical alpha/beta subunits joined by strong non-covalent forces, has one glycosylation site located in the alpha subunit [[cite:PUB00006359]] and plays a major role in the degradation of glycoproteins.</p>\n\n<p>L-asparaginases catalyse the following reaction:</p>\n\n<p><reaction> L-asparagine + H<sub>2</sub>O = L-aspartate + NH<sub>3</sub> </reaction></p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zal", "name" "Crystal structure of E. coli isoaspartyl aminopeptidase/L-asparaginase in complex with L-aspartate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029055", "name" "Nucleophile aminohydrolases, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10188" "L-ASPARAGINASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01112" "Asparaginase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase T2, asparaginase 2", "short" "Peptidase_T2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 65, "domain_architectures" 250, "proteomes" 5196, "taxa" 20690, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31283, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30786, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21502}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1365", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1365"} {"accession" "GenProp1404", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1404"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
