{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Microtubules are polymers of tubulin, a dimer of two 55kDa subunits, designated alpha and beta [[cite:PUB00000039], [cite:PUB00000978]]. Within the microtubule lattice, α-β heterodimers associate in a head-to-tail fashion, giving rise to microtubule polarity. Fluorescent labelling studies have suggested that tubulin is oriented in microtubules with beta-tubulin toward the plus end [[cite:PUB00006112]]. For maximal rate and extent of polymerisation into microtubules, tubulin requires GTP. Two molecules of GTP are bound at different sites, termed N and E. At the E (Exchangeable) site, GTP is hydrolysed during incorporation into the microtubule. Close to the E site is an invariant region rich in glycine residues, which is found in both chains and is thought to control access of the nucleotide to its binding site [[cite:PUB00002443]]. Most species, excepting simple eukaryotes, express a variety of closely-related alpha- and beta-isotypes. A third family member, gamma tubulin, has also been identified in a number of species. Gamma tubulin is found at microtubule-organising centres, such as the spindle poles or the centrosome, suggesting that it is involved in minus-end nucleation of microtubule assembly [[cite:PUB00000721]]. More recently, a new delta-type tubulin has been identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Mus musculus (Mouse), and is likely to be found in a number of other species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036525", "name" "Tubulin/FtsZ, GTPase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008280", "name" "Tubulin/FtsZ, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01224" "DELTATUBULIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Delta tubulin", "short" "Delta_tubulin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 953, "taxa" 3784, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15902, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1972, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1369}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002967", :literature {"PUB00000039" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Cleveland DW" "Sullivan KF."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
