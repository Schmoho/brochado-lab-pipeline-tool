{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>YaaA (also refer to as DUF328/UPF0246) is involved in DNA recombination and oxidative stress response, being a key element of the stress response to H2O2. It acts by reducing the level of intracellular iron levels after peroxide stress, thereby attenuating the Fenton reaction and the DNA damage that this would cause [[cite:PUB00077122]]. Yaa binds double-stranded, bulge-containing, bubble duplex and Holliday junction DNA with approximately equal affinity and ssDNA with lower affinity; DNA binding shows positive cooperativity [[cite:PUB00152827]]. Structure analysis of this protein revealed a new fold with a positively charged cleft and a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA-binding motif named as cantaloupe fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5caj", "name" "Crystal structure of E. coli YaaA, a member of the DUF328/UPF0246 family"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03883" "Peroxide stress protein YaaA"}, "panther" {"PTHR30283" "PEROXIDE STRESS RESPONSE PROTEIN YAAA"}, "hamap" {"MF_00652" "UPF0246 protein YaaA [yaaA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding and peroxide stress resistance protein YaaA", "short" "YaaA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 5165, "taxa" 19411, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21303, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16439}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005583", :literature {"PUB00077122" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Liu Y" "Bauer SC" "Imlay JA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
