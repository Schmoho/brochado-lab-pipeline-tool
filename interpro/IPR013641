{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Kti12 associates with Elongator complex, a six-subunit histone acetytransferase complex that functions with the elongating form of RNA polymerase II during transcription [[cite:PUB00020941]]. It is not a structural subunit but may play a regulatory role in Elongator function [[cite:PUB00098046]]. It has been shown that Kti12 is associated with chromatin throughout the genome, even in non-transcribed regions and in the absence of Elongator [[cite:PUB00020941]].
