{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The gene III product of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is known as virion-associated protein or P3 [[cite:PUB00069646]], which is tightly associated with the virus particles and has a regulatory function in the virus infection cycle. P3 decorate the virions; its N-terminal domain forms an antiparallel Î±-helical coiled-coil network at the surface and the C-terminal domain interacts with the C-terminal half of the viral coat protein [[cite:PUB00069648]]. It is a DNA binding protein in which the DNA binding activity is located on its C-terminal part [[cite:PUB00099091]]. A family of related proteins is expressed by other members of the Caulimoviridae.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03310" "Caulimovirus DNA-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Caulimovirus virion-associated protein", "short" "Caulimo_virion-assoc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 89, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 123, "sets" 0, "proteins" 123, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004986", :literature {"PUB00069646" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Giband M" "Mesnard JM" "Lebeurier G."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The gene III product (P15) of cauliflower mosaic virus is a DNA-binding protein while an immunologically related P11 polypeptide is associated with virions.", "year" 1986, "raw_pages" "2433-8", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16453711}, "PUB00069648" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Leclerc D" "Stavolone L" "Meier E" "Guerra-Peraza O" "Herzog E" "Hohn T."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Genes", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008121228637", "medline_journal" "Virus Genes", "title" "The product of ORF III in cauliflower mosaic virus interacts with the viral coat protein through its C-terminal proline rich domain.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "159-65", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11324752}, "PUB00099091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hoh F" "Uzest M" "Drucker M" "Plisson-Chastang C" "Bron P" "Blanc S" "Dumas C."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of cauliflower mosaic virus transmission by its insect vector.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "4706-13", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20181714}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004986", "name" "Caulimovirus virion-associated protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 27}}}
