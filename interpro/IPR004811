{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RelA/SpoT-homologue proteins (RHS) mediate the stringent response in bacteria which enables its metabolic adaptation under stress conditions. These enzymes synthesize the second messenger (p)ppGpp, a small molecule also known as 'alarmone', which is a regulatory metabolite of the stringent response, characterised by growth arrest and the modulation of gene expression in response to various nutritional stresses [[cite:PUB00095792], [cite:PUB00098872], [cite:PUB00059269]]. Including in this group of proteins are RelA and SpoT, whose functions differ somewhat. RelA ([ec:2.7.6.5]) produces pppGpp (or ppGpp) from ATP and GTP (or GDP), while SpoT ([ec:3.1.7.2]) is a bifunctional enzyme that degrades ppGpp, but can also act as a ppGpp synthetase. In many species, a single homologue to SpoT and RelA , Rsh, appears responsible for both ppGpp synthesis and ppGpp degradation [[cite:PUB00059271], [cite:PUB00059272], [cite:PUB00098863]]. ppGpp together with c-di-GMP play an important role to control biofilm formation in response to translational stress [[cite:PUB00055016]].</p>\n\n<p>These enzymes consist of a N-terminal domain which harbor (p)ppGpp hydrolase and synthetase activity and a stress-perceiving and regulatory C-terminal domain, which comprising four sub-domains: the TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT), AH (alpha helical), RIS (ribosome inter-subunit), and ACT (aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, TyrA) [[cite:PUB00095792], [cite:PUB00098872]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00691" "RelA/SpoT family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RelA/SpoT family", "short" "RelA/Spo_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8747, "taxa" 33950, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46591, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46591, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35705}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1755", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1755"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
