{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group contain a divergent form of CheB-like protein-glutamate methylesterase domain in the C-terminal region. This domain is usually found fused with CheY-like receiver (response regulator) domain, forming CheB response regulator methylesterase ([interpro:IPR008248]). The stand-alone form is presumed to be involved in the same process of regulating bacterial chemotaxis [[cite:PUB00015775]], but there is no experimental evidence to confirm this. Members of this family have an N-terminal domain which has some amino acid residues in common with the CheY-like receiver domain but it is not clear whether it is evolutionarily or functionally related to CheY.</p>\n\n<p>In bacterial chemotaxis, cellular movement is directed in response to chemical gradients. Transmembrane chemoreceptors that sense the stimuli are coupled (via a coupling protein, CheW) with a signal transduction histidine kinase (CheA). CheA phosphorylates response regulators CheB and CheY. Phosphorylated CheY binds to FliM, a component of the flagellar motor switch complex, and modulates the direction of flagellar rotation [[cite:PUB00011107]]. Response regulator CheB (receptor modification enzyme, protein-glutamate methylesterase) modulates the signalling output of the chemotaxis receptors through control of the level of chemoreceptor methylation [[cite:PUB00011107]]. Specific glutamyl residues in the transmembrane chemoreceptor cytoplasmic domain are methylated by methyltransferase CheR to form Î³-carboxyl glutamyl methyl esters. These esters can be hydrolysed by methylesterase CheB. Receptor modification resets the signalling states of receptors, allowing for responses to changes in concentration of the chemical stimuli irrespective of their absolute concentrations [[cite:PUB00011107]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036592" "Predicted chemotaxis methylesterase, CheB type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chemotaxis glutamate methyltransferase", "short" "Chemotax_glutamate_MeTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 94, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 87, "sets" 0, "proteins" 86, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 45}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012071", :literature {"PUB00015775" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Marchant J" "Wren B" "Ketley J."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Microbiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0966-842X(02)02323-5", "medline_journal" "Trends Microbiol", "title" "Exploiting genome sequence: predictions for mechanisms of Campylobacter chemotaxis.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "155-9", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11912013}, "PUB00011107" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Djordjevic S" "Stock AM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
