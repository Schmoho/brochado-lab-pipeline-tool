{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 19 (NUDT19 or RP2p) is a coenzyme A diphosphatase.  It hydrolases CoA esters, including choloyl-CoA and branched-chain fatty-acyl-CoA esters.  Medium and long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA esters are the primary substrates.  The protein contains a nudix hydrolase domain, a CoA-binding domain and a peroxisomal targeting signal at the C terminus, and activity in the mouse kidney is restricted to peroxisomes.  The enzyme is active at pH 9 or above and requires Mn<sup>2+</sup>or Mg<sup>2+</sup>ions [[cite:PUB00088948]].</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous uncharacterized bacterial and archaeal homologues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3qsj", "name" "Crystal structure of NUDIX hydrolase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12318" "TESTOSTERONE-REGULATED PROTEIN RP2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl-coenzyme A diphosphatase NUDT19", "short" "NUDT19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4728, "taxa" 15152, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14282, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14282, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10551}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
