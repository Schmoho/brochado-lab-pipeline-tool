{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding proteins (PBPs) of ABC transport systems that are involved in the uptake of osmoprotectants (also termed compatible solutes) such as ectoine and hydroxyectoine. To counteract the efflux of water, bacteria and archaea accumulate the compatible solutes for a sustained adjustment to high osmolarity surroundings [[cite:PUB00048895]]. This family are an example of type 2 periplasmic binding fold proteins, which are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap [[cite:PUB00056198]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry is named for one of the constituent proteins from Rhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti), involved in ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine uptake, both for osmoprotection and for catabolism.
