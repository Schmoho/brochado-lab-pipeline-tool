{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>2-phosphosulpholactate phosphatase (ComB; [ec:3.1.3.71]) is a magnesium-dependent acid phosphatase that catalyzes the second step in coenzyme M (CoM; 2-mercaptoethanesulphonic acid) biosynthesis, namely, the hydrolysis of (2R)-2-phospho-3-sulpholactate to yield (2R)-3-sulpholactate and phosphate. CoM is an essential cofactor that acts as the terminal methyl carrier in methanogenesis [[cite:PUB00010731]]. CoM has also a role in the bacterial pathway of aliphatic epoxide carboxylation [[cite:PUB00015795]]. Homologues of ComB have been identified in all available cyanobacterial genome sequences and in genomes from phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea. However, many of these organisms lack homologues of other CoM biosynthetic genes.</p>\r\n<p>ComB has a complex α/β topology. The monomer is composed of two domains thought to be related by a common ancestral gene, plus a C-terminal helical and β-hairpin region [[cite:PUB00035734]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2z0j", "name" "Crystal structure of uncharacterized conserved protein from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036702", "name" "ComB-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00490" "2-phosphosulfolactate phosphatase [comB]"}, "panther" {"PTHR37311" "2-PHOSPHOSULFOLACTATE PHOSPHATASE-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF04029" "2-phosphosulpholactate phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ComB-like", "short" "ComB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 23, "proteomes" 2189, "taxa" 8960, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9594, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9587, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7203}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
