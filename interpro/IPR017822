{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of hydrophobic presumed membrane proteins found in actinobacteria, including Alpha-(1->6)-mannopyranosyltransferase A from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MptA). MptA is involved in the latter stages of the biosynthesis of the alpha-(1->6) mannan core of lipomannan (LM) and catalyses the addition of alpha-(1->6)-mannose residue [[cite:PUB00106744]]. The genes encoding these proteins are syntenically associated with (found proximal to) genes involved in carotene biosynthesis, usually including phytoene synthase (crtB), phytoene dehydrogenase (crtI) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (ispA).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03459" "alpha-(1->6)-mannopyranosyltransferase A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-(1->6)-mannopyranosyltransferase A-like", "short" "MptA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 234, "taxa" 842, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 867, "sets" 0, "proteins" 867, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 701}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0758", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0758"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
