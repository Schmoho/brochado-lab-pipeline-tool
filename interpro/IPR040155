{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This represents CAATT-binding proteins and their homologues, including Mak21 from budding yeasts, protein SLOW WALKER2 (SWA2) from Arabidopsis and CEBPZ from human and its orthologue from Drosophila Nucleolar complex protein 1 (Noc1). Mak21, also known as Noc1, is required for 60 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis [[cite:PUB00019257]]. Together with Rrp5 and Noc2, Mak21 forms a protein module which is part of early large ribosomal subunit precursors [[cite:PUB00090618]]. SWA2 may play a role in ribosome biogenesis and is essential for coordinated cell cycle progression during female gametophyte development in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00090619]]. CEBPZ, the human homologue, regulates Hsp70 expression [[cite:PUB00019257]]. Noc1 from Drosophila is involved in rRNA processing and ribosome maturation[[cite:PUB00153394]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12048" "CCAAT-BINDING FACTOR-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CEBPZ/Mak21-like", "short" "CEBPZ/Mak21-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2569, "taxa" 8692, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4528, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4528, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2854}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040155", :literature {"PUB00090619" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Li N" "Yuan L" "Liu N" "Shi D" "Li X" "Tang Z" "Liu J" "Sundaresan V" "Yang WC."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.142414", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "SLOW WALKER2, a NOC1/MAK21 homologue, is essential for coordinated cell cycle progression during female gametophyte development in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1486-97", "volume" "151", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19734265}, "PUB00019257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Edskes HK" "Ohtake Y" "Wickner RB."], "ISO_journal" "J.
