{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Lipid A 4'-phosphatase from Francisella tularensis (LpxF) and related proteins. This enzyme removes the 4'-phosphate moiety from the tetraacylated precursor of lipid A and from pentaacylated lipid A, but not from hexaacylated lipid A which is found in E.coli. Its expression in E.coli confers resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B [[cite:PUB00154769]]. It plays a critical role in the ability of the bacteria to avoid the host innate immune system [[cite:PUB00154832]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036938", "name" "Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2/haloperoxidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045633" "lipid A 4'-phosphatase LpxF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid A 4'-phosphatase", "short" "LpxF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 37, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054677", :literature {"PUB00154832" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Wang X" "Ribeiro AA" "Guan Z" "Abraham SN" "Raetz CR."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0611606104", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Attenuated virulence of a Francisella mutant lacking the lipid A 4'-phosphatase.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "4136-41", "volume" "104", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17360489}, "PUB00154769" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Wang X" "McGrath SC" "Cotter RJ" "Raetz CR."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M600435200", "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Expression cloning and periplasmic orientation of the Francisella novicida lipid A 4'-phosphatase LpxF.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "9321-30", "volume" "281", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16467300}, "PUB00154770" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Schilling B" "McLendon MK" "Phillips NJ" "Apicella MA" "Gibson BW."], "ISO_journal" "Anal Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1021/ac061654e", "medline_journal" "Anal Chem", "title" "Characterization of lipid A acylation patterns in Francisella tularensis, Francisella novicida, and Francisella philomiragia using multiple-stage mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization on an intermediate vacuum source linear ion trap.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1034-42", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17263332}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054677", "name" "Lipid A 4'-phosphatase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
