{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase from human (PhyH) and similar proteins found in animals, bacteria and some fungal species. PhyH catalyses the 2-hydroxylation of not only racemic phytanoyl-CoA and the isomers of 3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA, but also a variety of other mono-branched 3-methylacyl-CoA esters (with a chain length of at least seven carbon atoms) and straight-chain acyl-CoA esters (with a chain length longer than four carbon atoms) [[cite:PUB00101995], [cite:PUB00101992], [cite:PUB00101994], [cite:PUB00101993]].
