{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Orf10 protein of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease called \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19). Orf10 appears to have no homologous proteins in SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses and is uniquely expressed in SARS-CoV-2 [[cite:PUB00100409], [cite:PUB00095887], [cite:PUB00095918]]. Recently, it was reported that Orf10  suppresses the IFN-I signalling pathway through the interaction with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), which is degraded via Orf10-induced autophagy pathway. Orf10 interacts with NIX and LC3B and induces mitophagy [[cite:PUB00100409]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21597" "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Orf10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Orf10 protein, SARS-CoV-2", "short" "Orf10_SARS-CoV-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044342", :literature {"PUB00100409" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Li X" "Hou P" "Ma W" "Wang X" "Wang H" "Yu Z" "Chang H" "Wang T" "Jin S" "Wang X" "Wang W" "Zhao Y" "Zhao Y" "Xu C" "Ma X" "Gao Y" "He H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Mol Immunol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Mol Immunol", "title" "SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 suppresses the antiviral innate immune response by degrading MAVS through mitophagy.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "67-78", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34845370}, "PUB00095918" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Xu J" "Zhao S" "Teng T" "Abdalla AE" "Zhu W" "Xie L" "Wang Y" "Guo X."], "ISO_journal" "Viruses", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Viruses", "title" "Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32098422}, "PUB00095887" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7798", "authors" ["Wu F" "Zhao S" "Yu B" "Chen YM" "Wang W" "Song ZG" "Hu Y" "Tao ZW" "Tian JH" "Pei YY" "Yuan ML" "Zhang YL" "Dai FH" "Liu Y" "Wang QM" "Zheng JJ" "Xu L" "Holmes EC" "Zhang YZ."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "265-269", "volume" "579", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32015508}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044342", "name" "Orf10 protein, SARS-CoV-2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
