{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>WW domain-binding protein 4 (WBP4; also known as formin-binding protein 21) is a component of the spliceosome, which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00090272]]. It contains a matrin-type zinc finger and two tandem WW domains. It interacts with the splicing factor SIPP1, and its binding and activation of pre-mRNA splicing depend on the WW domains [[cite:PUB00052665]]. This entry also includes zinc finger protein ZOP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is also a pre-mRNA splicing factor that associates with several typical components of the splicing machinery and promotes Pol IV-dependent siRNA accumulation, DNA methylation, and transcriptional silencing [[cite:PUB00085725]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13173" "WW DOMAIN BINDING PROTEIN 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WW domain-binding protein 4", "short" "WBP4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2283, "taxa" 7878, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3663, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3663, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2404}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040023", :literature {"PUB00090272" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bertram K" "Agafonov DE" "Dybkov O" "Haselbach D" "Leelaram MN" "Will CL" "Urlaub H" "Kastner B" "Luhrmann R" "Stark H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.011", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Cryo-EM Structure of a Pre-catalytic Human Spliceosome Primed for Activation.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "701-713.e11", "volume" "170", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28781166}, "PUB00052665" {"URL" nil, "issue" "37", "authors" ["Huang X" "Beullens M" "Zhang J" "Zhou Y" "Nicolaescu E" "Lesage B" "Hu Q" "Wu J" "Bollen M" "Shi Y."], "ISO_journal" "J.
