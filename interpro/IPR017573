{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CbsB, a hydrophobic protein which is found in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and several other members of the Sulfolobales, a branch of the Crenarchaeota [[cite:PUB00043422], [cite:PUB00043067]]. Encoded at the same locus as CbsB are: CbsA, a high potential cytochrome b558/566, SoxL, a Rieske iron-sulphur protein, SoxN, a predicted membrane-bound b-type cytochrome b, and OdsN, a protein of unknown function. Transcriptional studies suggest that these proteins may form a complex analogous to the cytochrome bc1 complex. The redox-active subunits of this complex would consist of CbsA, SoxL and SoxN, while CbsB and OdsN would be additional non-redox-active subunits. A possible function for CbsB, based on its hydrophobicity, would be to anchor CbsA to the membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03155" "cytochrome b558/566 subunit B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b558/566, subunit B", "short" "Cyt_b558/566_suB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 71, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 51, "sets" 0, "proteins" 51, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 40}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0695", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0695"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017573", :literature {"PUB00043422" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Hettmann T" "Schmidt CL" "Anemuller S" "Zahringer U" "Moll H" "Petersen A" "Schafer G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
