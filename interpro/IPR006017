{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Caldesmon (CDM) is an actin- and myosin-binding protein implicated in the regulation of actomyosin interactions in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, possibly acting as a bridge between myosin and actin filaments [[cite:PUB00001815]]. CDM is believed to be an elongated molecule, with an N-terminal myosin/calmodulin- binding domain and a C-terminal tropomyosin/actin/calmodulin-binding domain, separated by a 40nm-long central helix [[cite:PUB00001815]]. <p>A high-molecular-weight form of CDM is predominantly expressed in smooth muscles, while a low-molecular-weight form is widely distributed in non- muscle tissues and cells (the protein is not expressed in skeletal muscle or heart).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01076" "CALDESMON"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Caldesmon", "short" "Caldesmon"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 601, "taxa" 2064, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1971, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1197}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006017", :literature {"PUB00001815" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Humphrey MB" "Herrera-Sosa H" "Gonzalez G" "Lee R" "Bryan J."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(92)90376-Z", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Cloning of cDNAs encoding human caldesmons.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "197-204", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1555769}, "PUB00003449" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bryan J" "Lee R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
