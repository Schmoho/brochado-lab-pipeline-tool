{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol-P GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT) catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P to form GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol [[cite:PUB00081590]]. The reaction is the first step in the assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide intermediates and is essential for eukaryotic N-glycosylation [[cite:PUB00001987]]. GPT activity has been identified in all eukaryotic cells examined to date. A series of six conserved motifs designated A through F, ranging in length from 5 to 13 amino acid residues, has been identified in this family. They have been determined to be important for stable expression, substrate binding, or catalytic activities [[cite:PUB00081591]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06855" "GT_GPT_euk"}, "panther" {"PTHR10571" "UDP-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE--DOLICHYL-PHOSPHATE N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINEPHOSPHOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-GlcNAc-dolichyl-phosphate GlcNAc phosphotransferase", "short" "GPT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2528, "taxa" 8904, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4902, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4884, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3290}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
