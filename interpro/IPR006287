{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycation is a nonenzymatic covalent reaction between proteins and endogenous reducing sugars or dicarbonyls (methylglyoxal, glyoxal) that results in protein inactivation. DJ-1 was described in vitro as a protein deglycase that repaired methylglyoxal-and glyoxal-glycated proteins [[cite:PUB00079190], [cite:PUB00079193]]. Since then there have been reports against [[cite:PUB00084366]], and supporting this role for DJ-1 [[cite:PUB00084367]].\r\nFurthermore, supporting its deglycase activity, DJ-1 and its bacterial homologues have been shown to be able to repair methylglyoxal-and glyoxal-glycated nucleotides and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00086596]]. This ability would make DJ-1 a target for diabetic and cancer research [[cite:PUB00086597]]. DJ-1, also known as Park7, has been associated with human parkinsonism [[cite:PUB00079191]].</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Included in this family is also YajL from Escherichia coli, the bacterial homologue of DJ-1 [[cite:PUB00079194], [cite:PUB00079195]]. This group of proteins are classified as either DJ-1 putative peptidases or non-peptidase homologues in MEROPS peptidase family C56 (clan PC(C)).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2r1u", "name" "DJ-1 activation by catechol quinone modification"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01383" "DJ-1 family glyoxalase III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein/nucleic acid deglycase DJ-1", "short" "DJ-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 71, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3296, "taxa" 14703, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13989, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9502}, "pathways" 70}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
