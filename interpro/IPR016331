{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit A of Shiga-like toxin also known as rRNA N-glycosidase; [ec:3.2.2.22]), which are responsible for inactivation of the ribosome. Shiga-like toxins are produced by Shigella dysenteriae and by bacteriophage that infect Escherichia coli cells [[cite:PUB00042798]]. These toxins contain a single A subunit that has N-glycosidase activity and multiple copies of the B subunit that binds to the membrane glycolipid, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). The A subunit is responsible for inhibiting protein synthesis through the catalytic inactivation of 60S ribosomal subunits. It catalyses the endohydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond at one specific adenosine on the 28S rRNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4m1u", "name" "The crystal structure of Stx2 and a disaccharide ligand"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036041", "name" "Ribosome-inactivating protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016138", "name" "Ribosome-inactivating protein, subdomain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001924" "Shigella toxin, subunit A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shiga-like toxin, subunit A", "short" "Shiga-like_toxin_subunit_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 233, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 317, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 170}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
