{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, daughter-specific genetic programs induce distinct fates for mother and daughter cells. Some daughter-specific gene products have been shown to contribute to cell separation by degrading the cell wall [[cite:PUB00060245]]. A group of these genes (including ENG1, SCW11, DSE1 and DSE2) are regulated by the transcription factor Ace2p [[cite:PUB00060246]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, the DSE2 gene has been shown to encode a secreted protein with sequence similarity to glucanases. It is believed that this protein contributes to the degradation of the cell wall from the daughter side, causing daughter cells to separate from mother cells [[cite:PUB00060245]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02066" "Daughter-specific expression protein 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Daughter-specific expression protein 2", "short" "DSE2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 192, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 102, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 72}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026225", :literature {"PUB00060245" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Colman-Lerner A" "Chin TE" "Brent R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00596-7", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Yeast Cbk1 and Mob2 activate daughter-specific genetic programs to induce asymmetric cell fates.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "739-50", "volume" "107", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11747810}, "PUB00060246" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Ufano S" "Pablo ME" "Calzada A" "del Rey F" "Vazquez de Aldana CR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
