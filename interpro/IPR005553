{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Clag (cytoadherence linked asexual gene) is a malaria surface protein which has been shown to be involved in the binding of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes to host endothelial cells, a process termed cytoadherence. The cytoadherence phenomenon is associated with the sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the blood vessels of the brain, cerebral malaria. Clag is a multi-gene family in P. falciparum with at least 9 members identified to date.  Orthologous proteins in the rodent malaria species Plasmodium chabaudi suggest that the gene family is found in other malaria species and may play a more generic role in cytoadherence.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03805" "Cytoadherence-linked asexual protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytoadherence-linked asexual protein", "short" "CLAG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 38, "taxa" 127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 637, "sets" 0, "proteins" 588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 307}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005553", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0020035", "name" "adhesion of symbiont to microvasculature", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005553", "name" "Cytoadherence-linked asexual protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 141}}}
