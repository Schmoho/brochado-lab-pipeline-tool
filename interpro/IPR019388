{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein family (FIT/FITM, also known as Acyl-coenzyme A diphosphatase [ec:3.6.1]) plays an important role in lipid droplet accumulation. They are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident membrane proteins that induce lipid droplet accumulation in cell culture and when expressed in mouse liver [[cite:PUB00045330]]; they hydrolyses fatty acyl-CoA to yield acyl-4'-phosphopantetheine and adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate, with preference of unsaturated long-chain acyl-CoA substrates in the ER [[cite:PUB00096684]]. The ability to store fat in the form of cytoplasmic triglyceride droplets is conserved from yeast to humans, important for maintaining ER structure and for lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis, which are lipid storage organelles involved in maintaining lipid and energy homeostasis [[cite:PUB00045330], [cite:PUB00096683]]. The FIT family of proteins are not involved in triglyceride biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00054151]].</p>\n\n<p>In mammals there are two FIT proteins, FIT1, which is muscle specific and FIT2, which is expressed in most other tissues [[cite:PUB00100569], [cite:PUB00096684]]. Yeast has two FIT2 orthologues, called Scs3p and Yft2p but no FITM1. FIT1 and FIT2 proteins are six-transmembrane-domain containing proteins with both the N and C termini residing in the cytosol. FIT2 is the more ancient conserved homologue of the FIT family; this family of proteins do not share sequence similarity to known proteins or domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10261" "Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR23129" "ACYL-COENZYME A DIPHOSPHATASE FITM2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein", "short" "FIT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 66, "proteomes" 1969, "taxa" 6544, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3669, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3621, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2307}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
