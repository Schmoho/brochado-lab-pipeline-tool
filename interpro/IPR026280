{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tissue-type plasminogen activator is a serine peptidase belonging to MEROPS peptidase family S1 (chymotrypsin family, clan PA(S)), subfamily S1A.</p>\r\n<p>The fibrinolytic system is the mechanism by which blood clots are dissolved via the plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin into soluble end products. The system is activated by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; [ec:3.4.21.73]) or by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA; [ec:3.4.21.68]; this family), which are enzymes that convert the inactive proenzyme plasminogen to the active protease plasmin [[cite:PUB00011148]].</p>\r\n<p>tPA is mainly involved in the activation of circulating plasminogen, while uPA activates cell-bound plasminogen after binding to a specific uPA receptor (uPAR).</p>\n\n<p>Following the signal sequence and propeptide regions, tPA typically contains a fibronectin type I (FN1) domain, an EGF-type domain, two kringle domains and a trypsin domain. However, there are members missing FN1 or EGF or one of the kringles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes salivary plaminogen activators from the vampire bat (<i>Desmodus rotundus</i>).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001145" "Tissue plasminogen activator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tissue plasminogen activator", "short" "Tissue_plasm_act"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 586, "taxa" 2033, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1577, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1269, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 828}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
