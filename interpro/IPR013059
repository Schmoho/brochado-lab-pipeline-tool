{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amino acid permeases are integral membrane proteins involved in the transport of amino acids into the cell. A number of such proteins have been found to be evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00003402], [cite:PUB00001779], [cite:PUB00005006]].</p>\n\n<p>Aromatic amino acids are concentrated in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli by 4 distinct transport systems: a general aromatic amino acid permease, and a specific permease for each of the 3 types (Phe, Tyr and Trp) [[cite:PUB00002131]]. It has been shown [[cite:PUB00002141]] that some permeases in E. coli and related bacteria are evolutionary related. These permeases are proteins of about 400 to 420 amino acids and are located in the cytoplasmic membrane and, like bacterial sugar/cation transporters, are thought to contain 12 transmembrane (TM) regions [[cite:PUB00002131]] - hydropathy analysis, however, is inconclusive, suggesting the possibility of 10 to 12 membrane-spanning domains [[cite:PUB00002141]]. The best conserved domain is a stretch of 20 residues which seems to be located in a cytoplasmic loop between the first and second transmembrane region.</p>\n\n<p>This family is specific for aromatic amino acid transporters and includes the tyrosine permease, TyrP, and the tryptophan transporters TnaB and Mtr of E. coli.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46997" "LOW AFFINITY TRYPTOPHAN PERMEASE-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00837" "aromatic amino acid transporter"}, "prints" {"PR00166" "AROAAPRMEASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tryptophan/tyrosine transporter", "short" "Trp_tyr_transpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 463, "taxa" 3418, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8460, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7087, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5364}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013059", :literature {"PUB00003402" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Weber E" "Chevallier MR" "Jund R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
