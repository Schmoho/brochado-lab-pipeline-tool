{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pop8 is a component of ribonuclease P, a protein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends. It is also a component of Ribonuclease MRP, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences [[cite:PUB00045988]]. Ribonuclease P consists of an RNA moiety and at least 9 protein subunits including POP1, POP3, POP4, POP5, POP6, POP7, POP8, RPP1 and RPR2. Ribonuclease MRP complex consists of an RNA moiety and at least 10 protein subunits including POP1, POP3, POP4, POP5, POP6, POP7, POP8, RMP1, RPP1 and SNM1, many of which are shared with the Ribonuclease P complex. This protein is found at the nucleus. Pop8 interacts with Pop5 and RPP1 to form the Pop5-Pop8-(RPP1)2 heterotetramer, which is part of the\narm module of the p[protein hook [[cite:PUB00100655]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28173" "RIBONUCLEASES P/MRP PROTEIN SUBUNIT POP8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonucleases P/MRP protein subunit Pop8", "short" "Pop8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 695, "taxa" 1886, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1031, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1031, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 673}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
