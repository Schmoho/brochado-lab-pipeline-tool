{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>G patch domain-containing protein 3 (GPATCH3) is a transcriptional regulator during embryonic development, activating the CXCR4 promoter.  The CXCR4 gene is involved in embryo neural crest cell migration.  Because the GPATCH3 protein is detected in human tissues relevant to glaucoma, GPATCH3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of congenital glaucoma [[cite:PUB00090832]].  GPATCH3 is also a negative regulator of retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor-mediated antiviral signaling pathways, a means to control the response triggered by the presence of viral RNA by interacting with VISA (an adaptor of virus-triggered, RLR-mediated induction of innate antiviral responses), and disrupting the assembly of the virus-induced VISA signalosome [[cite:PUB00090833]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this family contain a G-patch domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14390" "G PATCH DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G patch domain-containing protein 3", "short" "GPATCH3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 774, "taxa" 2886, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1174, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1174, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 835}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040341", :literature {"PUB00090832" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ferre-Fernandez JJ" "Aroca-Aguilar JD" "Medina-Trillo C" "Bonet-Fernandez JM" "Mendez-Hernandez CD" "Morales-Fernandez L" "Corton M" "Cabanero-Valera MJ" "Gut M" "Tonda R" "Ayuso C" "Coca-Prados M" "Garcia-Feijoo J" "Escribano J."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46175", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Whole-Exome Sequencing of Congenital Glaucoma Patients Reveals Hypermorphic Variants in GPATCH3, a New Gene Involved in Ocular and Craniofacial Development.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "46175", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28397860}, "PUB00090833" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Nie Y" "Ran Y" "Zhang HY" "Huang ZF" "Pan ZY" "Wang SY" "Wang YY."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006328", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "GPATCH3 negatively regulates RLR-mediated innate antiviral responses by disrupting the assembly of VISA signalosome.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "e1006328", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28414768}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0032480", "name" "negative regulation of type I interferon production", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0039536", "name" "negative regulation of RIG-I signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040341", "name" "G patch domain-containing protein 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
