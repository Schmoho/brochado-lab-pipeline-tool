{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents protein phosphatase CheZ. CheZ family members are broadly distributed and play significant roles in chemotaxis systems in Gram-negative bacteria. This phosphatase efficiently dephosphorylates proteins from the chemotaxis system CheY(HP) and CheAY, and has additional weak activity on CheV2 [[cite:PUB00106283]]. It was shown that in Helicobacter pylori, the CheZ phosphatase localises to the bacterial pole and its localisation depends on the interactions with ChePep chemotaxis protein [[cite:PUB00106284]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041271" "protein phosphatase CheZ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase CheZ", "short" "CheZ_Pase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 98, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 147, "sets" 0, "proteins" 147, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 123}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
