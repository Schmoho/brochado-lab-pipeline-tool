{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase DddP from Roseovarius nubinhibens and similar protein sequences from proteobacteria and some fungal species. DddP is capable of cleaving dimethylsulfonioproprionate (DMSP), releasing dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the principal form by which sulphur is transported from oceans to the atmosphere [[cite:PUB00153442], [cite:PUB00153441]], although the real activity of the protein is yet unclear as the low activity with DMSP as substrate suggests that DMSP is not its native substrate [[cite:PUB00153704]]. Interestingly, the structure of DddP from Roseobacter denitrificans revealed a metalloproteinase-like fold [[cite:PUB00153443]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4rzy", "name" "Crystal structure of metallopeptidase-like dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase RlDddP in complex with MES"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036005", "name" "Creatinase/aminopeptidase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043017" "dimethylsulfonioproprionate lyase DddP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase DddP", "short" "DddP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 215, "taxa" 750, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 614, "sets" 0, "proteins" 614, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 441}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
