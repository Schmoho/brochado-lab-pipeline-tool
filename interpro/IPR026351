{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins predominantly found in bacteria that have an N-terminal radical SAM domain and a C-terminal domain whose function is unknown (see [interpro:IPR024521]). The C-terminal region has several conserved Cys residues, one of which is replaced by selenocysteine in at least five bacterial reference genomes. Slr0304 protein from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ([swissprot:Q55908]) and Slr3097 protein from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 ([swissprot:Q8YSI8]), included in this family, have been named as ArsS, a radical SAM enzyme involved in arsenosugar biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00105561]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43728" "SLR0304 PROTEIN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04167" "arsenosugar biosynthesis radical SAM (seleno)protein ArsS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenosugar biosynthesis radical SAM protein ArsS-like", "short" "rSAM_ArsS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1097, "taxa" 5584, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3808}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1053", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1053"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026351", :literature {"PUB00105561" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Xue XM" "Ye J" "Raber G" "Rosen BP" "Francesconi K" "Xiong C" "Zhu Z" "Rensing C" "Zhu YG."], "ISO_journal" "Environ Sci Technol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Environ Sci Technol", "title" "Identification of Steps in the Pathway of Arsenosugar Biosynthesis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "634-641", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30525501}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026351", "name" "Arsenosugar biosynthesis radical SAM protein ArsS-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
