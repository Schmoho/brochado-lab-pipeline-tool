{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The DNA polymerase III holoenzyme ([ec:2.7.7.7]) is the polymerase responsible for the replication of the Escherichia coli chromosome. The holoenzyme is composed of the DNA polymerase III core, the sliding clamp, and the DnaX clamp loading complex. The DnaX complex contains either the tau or gamma product of gene dnax, complexed to delta.delta and to chi psi. Chi forms a 1:1 heterodimer with psi. The chi psi complex functions by increasing the affinity of tau and gamma for delta.delta allowing a functional clamp-loading complex to form at physiological subunit concentrations. Psi is responsible for the interaction with DnaX (gamma/tau), but psi is insoluble unless it is in a complex with chi [[cite:PUB00009966]]. Members of this protein family are mainly found in proteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3sxu", "name" "Structure of the E. coli SSB-DNA polymerase III interface"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036768", "name" "DNA polymerase III subunit chi superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38767" "DNA POLYMERASE III SUBUNIT CHI"}, "pfam" {"PF04364" "DNA polymerase III chi subunit, HolC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase III chi subunit, HolC", "short" "DNA_pol3_chi"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 3177, "taxa" 12481, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13462, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13456, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10513}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1117", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1117"} {"accession" "GenProp0263", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0263"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
