{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Drosophila protein 'enhancer of rudimentary' (gene (e(r)) is a small protein of 104 residues whose function is not yet clear. From an evolutionary point of view, it is highly conserved [[cite:PUB00001871]] and has been found to exist in probably all multicellular eukaryotic organisms. ERH has been implicated in the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis, DNA replication, transcription, mRNA splicing, cellular proliferation, tumorigenesis, and the Notch signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00093060]]. Fission yeast homologue of ERH is implicated in meiotic mRNA elimination during vegetative growth. It forms a stoichiometric complex with Mmi1 to promote meiotic mRNA decay and facultative heterochromatin assembly [[cite:PUB00093061], \n[cite:PUB00093063], [cite:PUB00094514]] in which the formation of ERH dimer is essential for the complex function.</p>\n<p>ERH has been shown to interact with SAFB1/SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor-B 1/2) at the nuclear matrix to regulate SR protein phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00093062]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2nml", "name" "Crystal structure of HEF2/ERH at 1.55 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035912", "name" "Enhancer of rudimentary superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS01290" "Enhancer of rudimentary signature"}, "pfam" {"PF01133" "Enhancer of rudimentary"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016393" "Enhancer of rudimentary"}, "panther" {"PTHR12373" "ENHANCER OF RUDIMENTARY ERH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Enhancer of rudimentary", "short" "ERH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 63, "proteomes" 1363, "taxa" 5539, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2844, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2820, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1898}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00992", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00992"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000781", :literature {"PUB00001871" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Gelsthorpe M" "Pulumati M" "McCallum C" "Dang-Vu K" "Tsubota SI."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(96)00701-9", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "The putative cell cycle gene, enhancer of rudimentary, encodes a highly conserved protein found in plants and animals.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "189-95", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9074495}, "PUB00094514" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hazra D" "Andric V" "Palancade B" "Rougemaille M" "Graille M."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Formation of S. pombe Erh1 homodimer mediates gametogenic gene silencing and meiosis progression.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1034", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31974447}, "PUB00093060" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Tsubota SI" "Phillips AC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Int", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Int", "title" "Drosophila Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog, ERH, Is a Binding Partner of RPS3, RPL19, and DDIT4, Suggesting a Mechanism for the Nuclear Localization of ERH.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "8371819", "volume" "2016", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27830090}, "PUB00093061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sugiyama T" "Thillainadesan G" "Chalamcharla VR" "Meng Z" "Balachandran V" "Dhakshnamoorthy J" "Zhou M" "Grewal SIS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
