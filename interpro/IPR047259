{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of plant proteins, such as QUIRKY and FTIP1/3/4/7 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00102365], [cite:PUB00102366]]. These are Multiple C2 domain and Transmembrane region Proteins (MCTPs) which are involved in Ca2 signalling at the membrane. Plant-MCTPs are composed of a variable N-terminal sequence, four C2 domains, two transmembrane regions (TMRs), and a short C-terminal sequence. It is one of four protein classes that are anchored to membranes via a transmembrane region; the others being synaptotagmins, extended synaptotagmins, and ferlins. MCTPs are the only membrane-bound C2 domain proteins that contain two functional TMRs. MCTPs are unique in that they bind Ca2 but not phospholipids.</p>\n\n<p>QUIRKY may contribute to plant organ organogenesis mediated by the receptor-like kinase STRUBBELIG and may play a role in Ca2-dependent signaling and membrane trafficking [[cite:PUB00102365]]. It has been shown to be required for the appropriate spatial expression of several epidermal cell fate regulators [[cite:PUB00102367]]. FTIP1 is involved in the export of FT from the phloem companion cells to the sieve elements through the plasmodesmata. It regulates flowering time under long days [[cite:PUB00102365]]. FTIP3/4 play an essential role in mediating proliferation and differentiation of shoot stem cells [[cite:PUB00102366]]. FTIP7 promotes nuclear translocation of the transcription factor OSH1 and reduces auxin levels at late stage of anther development, after meiosis of microspore mother cells. It is necessary for normal anther dehiscence and seed setting [[cite:PUB00102428]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31425" "PHOSPHORIBOSYLANTHRANILATE TRANSFERASE ISOFORM 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "QUIRKY-like", "short" "QUIRKY-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 284, "taxa" 1192, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6848, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6848, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3947}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047259", :literature {"PUB00103911" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Liu L" "Li C" "Liang Z" "Yu H."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Characterization of Multiple C2 Domain and Transmembrane Region Proteins in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "2119-2132", "volume" "176", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29259105}, "PUB00102365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Liu L" "Liu C" "Hou X" "Xi W" "Shen L" "Tao Z" "Wang Y" "Yu H."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "FTIP1 is an essential regulator required for florigen transport.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e1001313", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22529749}, "PUB00102366" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Liu L" "Li C" "Song S" "Teo ZWN" "Shen L" "Wang Y" "Jackson D" "Yu H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "FTIP-Dependent STM Trafficking Regulates Shoot Meristem Development in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1879-1890", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29742441}, "PUB00102367" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Song JH" "Kwak SH" "Nam KH" "Schiefelbein J" "Lee MM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "QUIRKY regulates root epidermal cell patterning through stabilizing SCRAMBLED to control CAPRICE movement in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1744", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30988311}, "PUB00102428" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Song S" "Chen Y" "Liu L" "See YHB" "Mao C" "Gan Y" "Yu H."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Plants", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Plants", "title" "OsFTIP7 determines auxin-mediated anther dehiscence in rice.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "495-504", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29915329}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047259", "name" "QUIRKY-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
