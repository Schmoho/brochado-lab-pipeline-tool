{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Caenorhabditis elegans specific ly-6-related HOT and ODR proteins. These proteins are involved in the olfactory system. Odr-2 mutants are known to be defective in the ability to chemotax to odorants that are recognised by the two AWC olfactory neurons. Odr-2 encodes a membrane-associated protein related to the Ly-6 superfamily of GPI-linked signalling proteins [[cite:PUB00012657]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34722" "HOMOLOG OF ODR-2 (TWO)-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF06579" "Caenorhabditis elegans ly-6-related protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Caenorhabditis elegans ly-6-related", "short" "Ly-6-related"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 91, "taxa" 271, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1092, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1068, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 722}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010558", :literature {"PUB00012657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chou JH" "Bargmann CI" "Sengupta P."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11139503", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The Caenorhabditis elegans odr-2 gene encodes a novel Ly-6-related protein required for olfaction.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "211-24", "volume" "157", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11139503}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010558", "name" "Caenorhabditis elegans ly-6-related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 14, "alignment:full" 687}}}
