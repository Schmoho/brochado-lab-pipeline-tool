{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Spot 14 family includes thyroid hormone-inducible hepatic protein (Spot 14), Mid1-interacting protein and related sequneces. Mainly expressed in tissues that synthesise triglycerides, the mRNA coding for Spot 14 has been shown to be increased in rat liver by insulin, dietary carbohydrates, glucose in hepatocyte culture medium, as well as thyroid hormone. In contrast, dietary fats and polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to decrease the amount of Spot 14 mRNA, while an elevated level of cAMP acts as a dominant negative factor. In addition, liver-specific factors or chromatin organisation of the gene have been shown to contribute to the regulation of its expression [[cite:PUB00012997]]. Spot 14 protein is thought to be required for induction of hepatic lipogenesis [[cite:PUB00012998]].  Mid1-interacting protein is involved in stabilisation of microtubules [[cite:PUB00054284]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053719", "name" "Lipogenesis and Microtubule Stabilization Superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07084" "Thyroid hormone-inducible hepatic protein Spot 14"}, "panther" {"PTHR14315" "SPOT14 FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spot 14 family", "short" "Spot_14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 848, "taxa" 3596, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2522, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2482, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1756}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009786", :literature {"PUB00012997" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Grillasca JP" "Gastaldi M" "Khiri H" "Dace A" "Peyrol N" "Reynier P" "Torresani J" "Planells R."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(96)01433-0", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Cloning and initial characterization of human and mouse Spot 14 genes.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "38-42", "volume" "401", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9003802}, "PUB00012998" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Zhu Q" "Mariash A" "Margosian MR" "Gopinath S" "Fareed MT" "Anderson GW" "Mariash CN."], "ISO_journal" "Endocrinology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/en.142.10.4363", "medline_journal" "Endocrinology", "title" "Spot 14 gene deletion increases hepatic de novo lipogenesis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "4363-70", "volume" "142", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11564699}, "PUB00054284" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Berti C" "Fontanella B" "Ferrentino R" "Meroni G."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Cell Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2121-5-9", "medline_journal" "BMC Cell Biol", "title" "Mig12, a novel Opitz syndrome gene product partner, is expressed in the embryonic ventral midline and co-operates with Mid1 to bundle and stabilize microtubules.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "9", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15070402}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009786", "name" "Spot 14 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 23, "alignment:full" 1713}}}
