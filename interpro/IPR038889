{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Shugoshin (which is Japanese for guardian spirit) was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster (originally named Mei-S322) as a protein that is required for sister chromatid cohesion [[cite:PUB00061690]]. Later, a few shugoshin orthologs from yeast to human were identified through similarities in their sequence architectures [[cite:PUB00061691]]. Flies and budding yeast have only one known shugoshin (Mei-S322 and Sgo1, respectively), fission yeast, Xenopus laevis and mammals have two shugoshin-like proteins (Sgo1 and Sgo2 in yeast and SGOL1 and SGOL2 in vertebrates) [[cite:PUB00061688]].The functions of Sgo1 from different species can vary. For instance, in S. cevervisiae and D. melanogaster, Sgo1 protects cohesion at meiosis but not mitosis. In humans and X. laevis, SGOL1 protect centromeric cohesion during mitosis  [[cite:PUB00061688]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family includes Shugoshin 1/2 from human and related sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21577" "SHUGOSHIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shugoshin 1/2", "short" "Shugoshin1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 659, "taxa" 2246, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1852, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1852, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1233}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038889", :literature {"PUB00061690" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kerrebrock AW" "Moore DP" "Wu JS" "Orr-Weaver TL."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(95)90166-3", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Mei-S332, a Drosophila protein required for sister-chromatid cohesion, can localize to meiotic centromere regions.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "247-56", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7585942}, "PUB00061688" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Gutierrez-Caballero C" "Cebollero LR" "Pendas AM."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2012.03.003", "medline_journal" "Trends Genet", "title" "Shugoshins: from protectors of cohesion to versatile adaptors at the centromere.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "351-60", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22542109}, "PUB00061691" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Rabitsch KP" "Gregan J" "Schleiffer A" "Javerzat JP" "Eisenhaber F" "Nasmyth K."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
