{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacteriophage Baseplate tube protein and related proteins, involved in the assembly of the simplified baseplate structure of bacteriophages. Baseplate tube protein p140, interacts with other proteins including the p132 collar protein ring and components of the cone, namely DTP-pb9 and BHP-pb3, to form a crucial part of the phage's baseplate. This structure is essential for the phage to attach to and penetrate the host bacterial cell wall during infection [[cite:PUB00155631]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23779" "Bacteriophage Baseplate Tube Protein Family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baseplate tube protein p140", "short" "Baseplate_tube_p140"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 484, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 327, "sets" 0, "proteins" 326, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056389", :literature {"PUB00155631" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Linares R" "Arnaud CA" "Effantin G" "Darnault C" "Epalle NH" "Boeri Erba E" "Schoehn G" "Breyton C."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade9674", "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Structural basis of bacteriophage T5 infection trigger and <i>E. coli</i> cell wall perforation.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "eade9674", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36961893}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056389", "name" "Baseplate tube protein p140", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 45}}}
