{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT) is involved in serine biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00060960], [cite:PUB00060961]]. The enzyme catalyses the reversible conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to L-phosphoserine. PSAT from Escherichia coli has been shown to be a homodimer of Mr79,000 with a conserved lysine that binds covalently to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). PSAT is a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme and belongs to the alpha family of PLP enzymes. PSAT is also classified as a member of the aspartate aminotransferase family of PLP enzymes [[cite:PUB00016898]]. According to the structural classification of PLP-dependent enzymes [[cite:PUB00027712]], PSAT belongs to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aspartate aminotransferase superfamily (fold I), where it is allocated to a separated subclass. The mechanism of action in all these enzymes is similar: PLP combines with an alpha-amino acid to form a compound called a Schiff base or aldimine intermediate, which, depending on the reaction, is the substrate in four kinds of reactions: transamination (movement of amino groups), racemization (redistribution of enantiomers), decarboxylation (removing COOH groups), and various side-chain reactions depending on the enzyme involved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1w23", "name" "Crystal structure of phosphoserine aminotransferase from Bacillus alcalophilus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00611" "PSAT_like"}, "panther" {"PTHR43247" "PHOSPHOSERINE AMINOTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00160" "Phosphoserine aminotransferase [serC]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000525" "Phosphoserine aminotransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01364" "phosphoserine transaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoserine aminotransferase", "short" "Pser_aminoTfrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10027, "taxa" 35796, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37277, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37263, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27779}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1633", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1633"} {"accession" "GenProp1640", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1640"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
