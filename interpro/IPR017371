{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily comprises more than 20 type-I transmembrane proteins. Family members are defined based on similarity in their extracellular domain -a region that contains many cysteine residues arranged in a specific repetitive pattern [[cite:PUB00046030]]. The cysteines allow formation of an extended rod-like structure, responsible for ligand binding [[cite:PUB00000892]].</p>\n\n<p>Upon receptor activation, different intracellular signalling complexes are assembled for different members of the TNFR superfamily, depending on their intracellular domains and sequences [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Activation of TNFRs can therefore induce a range of disparate effects, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, or apoptotic cell death, depending upon the receptor involved [[cite:PUB00046032], [cite:PUB00046033]].</p>\n\n<p>TNFRs are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial biological processes, such as lymphoid and neuronal development, innate and adaptive immunity, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Drugs that manipulate their signalling have potential roles in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, such as viral infections, coronary heart disease, transplant rejection, and immune disease [[cite:PUB00046034]].</p>\n\n<p>TNF receptors 11A and 11B mediate the effects of receptor activator for NF-kappa-B ligand (RANKL), an essential osteoclast regulatory factor. The receptors have opposing effects -activation of TNF receptor 11A by RANKL promotes osteoclast differentiation [[cite:PUB00053612]], while TNF receptor 11B acts as a soluble decoy receptor for the ligand, thus inhibiting differentiation [[cite:PUB00053613]].</p>\n\n<p>TNF receptor 11B (also known as osteoprotegerin (OPG)) is a secreted protein that contains two death domains within its C-terminal region. Mutations in the TNF receptor 11B gene are associated with the autosomal recessive osteopathy juvenile Paget disease [[cite:PUB00053636]]. The receptor may also be involved in vascular calcification, and high expression levels in serum are a risk factor for the progression of atherosclerosis and the onset of cardiovascular disease [[cite:PUB00053637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01975" "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 11B"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF038065" "Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 11B", "short" "TNFR_11B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 629, "taxa" 2112, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2052, "sets" 0, "proteins" 892, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 662}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017371", :literature {"PUB00053637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Kiechl S" "Schett G" "Wenning G" "Redlich K" "Oberhollenzer M" "Mayr A" "Santer P" "Smolen J" "Poewe W" "Willeit J."], "ISO_journal" "Circulation", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.0000127957.43874.BB", "medline_journal" "Circulation", "title" "Osteoprotegerin is a risk factor for progressive atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "2175-80", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15117849}, "PUB00046034" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Loenen WA."], "ISO_journal" "Semin.
