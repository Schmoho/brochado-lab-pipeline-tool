{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Muramic delta-lactam is an unusual constituent of peptidoglycan, found only in bacterial spores, in the peptidoglycan wall or spore cortex. This entry represents a subset of the larger polysaccharide deacetylase family that is specifically involved in delta-lactam biosynthesis. PdaA from Bacillus subtilis acts immediately after CwlD, an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and performs a de-N-acetylation [[cite:PUB00034580]]. PdaA may also perform the subsequent transpeptidation that leads to lactam ring formation, as heterologous expression in Escherichia coli of CwlD and PdaA together is sufficient for delta-lactam production [[cite:PUB00034579]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ny1", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF B.
