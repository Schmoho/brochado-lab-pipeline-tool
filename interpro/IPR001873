{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The apical membrane of many tight epithelia contains sodium channels that are primarily characterised by their high affinity to the diuretic blocker\namiloride [[cite:PUB00001528], [cite:PUB00003784], [cite:PUB00002932]]. These channels mediate the first step of active sodium\nreabsorption essential for the maintenance of body salt and water homeostasis [[cite:PUB00001528]]. In vertebrates, the channels control reabsorption of sodium in kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands; they also play a role in taste perception.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup>channel (ENaC) family fall into four subfamilies, termed alpha, beta, gamma and delta [[cite:PUB00003784]]. The proteins exhibit the same apparent topology, each with two transmembrane (TM) spanning segments, separated by a large extracellular loop. In most ENaC proteins studied to date, the extracellular domains are highly conserved and contain numerous cysteine residues, with flanking C-terminal amphipathic TM regions, postulated to contribute to the formation of the hydrophilic pores of the oligomeric channel protein complexes. It is thought that the well-conserved extracellular domains serve as receptors to control the activities of the channels.</p>\n\n<p>Vertebrate ENaC proteins are similar to degenerins of Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00002871]]: deg-1, del-1, mec-4, mec-10 and unc-8. These proteins can be mutated to cause neuronal degradation, and are also thought to form sodium channels.</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, the proteins that belong to this family consist of about 510 to 920 amino acid residues. They are made of an intracellular N terminus region followed by a transmembrane domain, a large extracellular loop, a second transmembrane segment and a C-terminal intracellular tail [[cite:PUB00002871]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qts", "name" "Structure of an acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 A resolution and low pH"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11690" "AMILORIDE-SENSITIVE SODIUM CHANNEL-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF00858" "Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel"}, "prints" {"PR01078" "AMINACHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Epithelial sodium channel", "short" "ENaC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 585, "proteomes" 1042, "taxa" 4248, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26991, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16399}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00926", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00926"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001873", :literature {"PUB00001528" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Garty H."], "ISO_journal" "FASEB J.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/8/522", "medline_journal" "FASEB J", "title" "Molecular properties of epithelial, amiloride-blockable Na+ channels.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "522-8", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8181670}, "PUB00003784" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Le T" "Saier MH Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
