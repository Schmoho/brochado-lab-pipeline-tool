{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A/B (CC2D1A/B, also known as Freud-1/2). CC2D1A is involved in many pathways, including nuclear factor kappaB, PDK1/Akt, cAMP/PKA, Notch and bone morphogenetic protein [[cite:PUB00090017]]. It is a calcium-regulated repressor of serotonine receptor 5-HT1A and dopamine-D2 receptor expression [[cite:PUB00087601], [cite:PUB00087602]]. CC2D1B binds to the 5-HT1A DRE and represses the human 5-HT1A receptor gene to regulate its expression in non-serotonergic cells and neurons [[cite:PUB00090019]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CC2D1A and CC2D1B have also been shown to interact with the CHMP4 family of proteins, the major subunit of the ESCRT-III complex. They may regulate degradation and signaling of EGFR and TLR4 [[cite:PUB00090017]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CC2D1A and CC2D1B share conserved domains, including several DM14 domains that are specific to this protein family, a C-terminal helix-loop-helix domain, and a C2 domain. The CC2D1A  C2 domain is thought to be calcium insensitive and it lacks several acidic residues that mediate calcium binding of the PKC C2 domain. In addition, it contains a poly-basic insert that is not present in calcium-dependent C2 domains and may function as a nuclear localization signal [[cite:PUB00087601]]. The CC2D1B C2 domain appears to be essential for its DNA binding and repressor function; it may mediate protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00087604]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vny", "name" "Crystal structure of DM14-3 domain of Lgd"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13076" "COILED-COIL AND C2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1", "short" "CC2D1A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1058, "taxa" 4184, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3380, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3380, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2058}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039725", :literature {"PUB00090017" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Deshar R" "Cho EB" "Yoon SK" "Yoon JB."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
