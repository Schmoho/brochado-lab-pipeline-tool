{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins consists of TMP21 (also known as transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10) and related proteins, which are members of the p24 family. The p24 family is a widely conserved family of transmembrane proteins that plays a functional role in the initiation of assembly of COPI (Coat protein I) coated vesicles. COPI coated vesicles are involved in protein transport within the early secretory pathway [[cite:PUB00034783], [cite:PUB00034784]].</p>\n\n<p>p24 proteins are major membrane components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles and are implicated in cargo selectivity of ER to Golgi transport [[cite:PUB00003083], [cite:PUB00009426]]. Multiple members of the p24 family are found in all eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals. Members of the p24 family are type I membrane proteins with a signal peptide at the amino terminus, a lumenal coiled-coil (extracytosolic) domain, a single transmembrane domain with conserved amino acids, and a short cytoplasmic tail. They may be grouped into at least three subfamilies based on primary sequence [[cite:PUB00009427]]. One subfamily comprises yeast Emp24p and mammalian p24A. Another subfamily comprises yeast Erv25p and mammalian Tmp21, and the third subfamily comprises mammalian gp25L proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5azw", "name" "Crystal structure of p24beta1 GOLD domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22811" "TRANSMEMBRANE EMP24 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein", "short" "Emp24-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2712, "taxa" 9406, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25781, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25781, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17044}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015720", :literature {"PUB00034783" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Carney GE" "Bowen NJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
