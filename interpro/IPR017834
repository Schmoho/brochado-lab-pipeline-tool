{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These proteins are members of the wider radical SAM superfamily of enzymes that enzymes utilise an iron-sulphur redox cluster and S-adenosylmethionine to carry out diverse radical mediated reactions [[cite:PUB00010539]]. The Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 protein (AFE_0975) is encoded in the same locus as the genes for squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, [interpro:IPR006400]) and other proteins associated with the biosynthesis of hopanoid natural products. Similarly, in Ralstonia eutropha (strain JMP134) (Alcaligenes eutrophus) (Reut_B4901) this protein is encoded adjacent to the genes for HpnAB, IspH and HpnH ([interpro:IPR017833]), although SHC itself is elsewhere in the genome. Notably, this protein (here named HpnJ) and three others form a conserved set (HpnIJKL) which occur in a subset of all genomes containing the SHC enzyme. This relationship was discerned using the method of partial phylogenetic profiling [[cite:PUB00034422]]. This group includes Zymomonas mobilis the organism where the initial hopanoid biosynthesis locus was described consisting of the genes HpnA-E and SHC (HpnF) [[cite:PUB00042985]]. Continuing past SHC are genes encoding a phosphorylase enzyme (ZMO0873, i.e. HpnG, [interpro:IPR017831]) and another radical SAM enzyme (ZMO0874), HpnH. Although discontinuous in Z. mobilis, we continue the gene symbol sequence with HpnIJKL. One of the well-described hopanoid intermediates is bacteriohopanetetrol. In the conversion from hopene several reactions must occur in the side chain for which a radical mechanism might be reasonable. These include the four (presumably anaerobic) hydroxylations and a methyl shift.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00404" "hopanetetrol cyclitol ether synthase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03471" "hopanoid biosynthesis associated radical SAM protein HpnJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hopanoid biosynthesis associated radical SAM protein HpnJ", "short" "Hopanoid_synth-assoc_rSAM_HpnJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 343, "taxa" 1667, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1556, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1556, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1221}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017834", :literature {"PUB00010539" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sofia HJ" "Chen G" "Hetzler BG" "Reyes-Spindola JF" "Miller NE."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/29.5.1097", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Radical SAM, a novel protein superfamily linking unresolved steps in familiar biosynthetic pathways with radical mechanisms: functional characterization using new analysis and information visualization methods.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1097-106", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11222759}, "PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
