{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>2',3' Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (CPDases) are enzymes that catalyse at least two distinct steps in the splicing of tRNA introns in eukaryotes. The active site is characterised by two conserved histidine residues [[cite:PUB00013642]]. The enzyme has six cysteine residues, four of which are involved in forming two intra-molecular disulphide bridges. One of these bridges is involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme as it opens when CPDase is semi-reduced [[cite:PUB00013260]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entryand belong to [ec:3.1.4.37] and catalyse the reaction <reaction>Nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate + H2O = nucleoside 2'-phosphate.</reaction></p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jh6", "name" "Semi-reduced Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase from Arabidopsis thaliana"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009097", "name" "Cyclic phosphodiesterase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28141" "2',3'-CYCLIC-NUCLEOTIDE 3'-PHOSPHODIESTERASE"}, "pfam" {"PF07823" "Cyclic phosphodiesterase-like protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017903" "2',3' cyclic phosphodiesterase, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase", "short" "Cyclic-nucl_3Pdiesterase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 38, "proteomes" 946, "taxa" 3846, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2464, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2446, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1616}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
