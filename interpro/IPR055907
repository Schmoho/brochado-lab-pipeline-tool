{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents an uncharacterised family of phage proteins. These proteins consist of two domains. The first is composed of four α-helices that are contributed by both the N and C-terminal of the protein. The second domain is a central β domain. Structure prediction suggests that these proteins might form a large homo-oligomeric ring of 8-10 subunits, but the iPTM scores are marginal.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24302" "Family of unknown function (DUF7484)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7484", "short" "DUF7484"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 56, "taxa" 329, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 180, "sets" 0, "proteins" 180, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055907", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055907", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7484", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 36, "alignment:full" 62}}}
