{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of RanGTP-binding proteins that contain a conserved RanGTP-binding motif, also called a Ran-binding domain (RBD). They have been implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport. NUP358 (RanBP2) is localised to the cytoplasmic filaments protruding from the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the cytoplasm, while RanBP3/Hba1 are localised to the nucleoplasm and Nup2 is localised to the NPC. In general, RanBP1 and other members of this protein family increase, via their conserved RBDs, the rate of RanGAP1-mediated GTP hydrolysis on Ran [[cite:PUB00098388]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4hat", "name" "Crystal structure of CRM1 inhibitor Leptomycin B in complex with CRM1-Ran-RanBP1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23138" "RAN BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ran binding protein RanBP1-like", "short" "RanBP1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 100, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2705, "taxa" 9304, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15238, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15238, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8571}, "pathways" 104}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
