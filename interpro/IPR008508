{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of several bacterial and archaeal endonuclease proteins that may be involved in either restriction-modification and/or DNA excision repair [[cite:PUB00020736]]. Among its members is endonuclease Bax1 from archaea, a dual DNA endonuclease probably involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) [[cite:PUB00153767]]. The N-terminal nuclease domain (NTD) of the XPB-Bax1 complex cleaves on one side of a DNA bubble (which presumably mimics DNA damage), while the NUS nuclease domain cleaves the other side, respectively called 5' and 3' nuclease activities [[cite:PUB00153767]]. In the absence of its XPB partner, Bax1 has weak 5' nuclease activity [[cite:PUB00153767], [cite:PUB00153768]]. Bax1 binds to and represses the ATPase activity (and probably also helicase activity) of XPB2 [[cite:PUB00153767]]. The two helicase and the ThM domains of XPB2 with the NTD and CRD domains of Bax1 encircle the DNA, forming a tunnel where the 12 bp dsDNA and the ds-ssDNA junction are located [[cite:PUB00153768]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8gy8", "name" "The structure of Bax1 from Pyrococcus furiosus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39640" "VNG6129C"}, "pfam" {"PF05626" "Protein of unknown function (DUF790)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019435" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP019435 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endonuclease Bax1", "short" "Bax1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 446, "taxa" 2844, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2611, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2560, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1952}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008508", :literature {"PUB00020736" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kinch LN" "Ginalski K" "Rychlewski L" "Grishin NV."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki676", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Identification of novel restriction endonuclease-like fold families among hypothetical proteins.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3598-605", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15972856}, "PUB00153768" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["He F" "DuPrez K" "Hilario E" "Chen Z" "Fan L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa801", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Structural basis of the XPB helicase-Bax1 nuclease complex interacting with the repair bubble DNA.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "11695-11705", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32986831}, "PUB00153767" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["DuPrez K" "He F" "Chen Z" "Hilario E" "Fan L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa324", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Structural basis of the XPB-Bax1 complex as a dynamic helicase-nuclease machinery for DNA repair.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "6326-6339", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32374860}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008508", "name" "Endonuclease Bax1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 57, "alignment:full" 544}}}
