{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family average just 38 amino acids in length, but are widely conserved among species of Gram-positive firmicutes. Expression of an RNA designated RsaX20, which encodes a member of this family, was studied in a Staphylococcus aureus of possible structural RNAs, and shown to be controlled by Fur-like transcription factor Zur. The broad conservation of the coding region across multiple species and protein-like pattern of amino acid substitutions in multiple sequence alignments strongly suggests that that members of this family are indeed translated into functional proteins [[cite:PUB00105525]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038026" "putative metal homeostasis protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RsaX20-like", "short" "RsaX20-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 458, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 397, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 293}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049844", :literature {"PUB00105525" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Liu W" "Rochat T" "Toffano-Nioche C" "Le Lam TN" "Bouloc P" "Morvan C."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "Assessment of <i>Bona Fide</i> sRNAs in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "228", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29515534}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049844", "name" "RsaX20-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
