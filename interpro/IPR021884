{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ice-binding proteins mainly found in bacteria and fungi. In Antarctic bacterium Flavobacterium frigoris PS1, FfIBP is an ice-binding protein (IBP) that inhibits ice growth through direct interaction with ice crystals to permit the survival of polar organisms in extremely cold environments [[cite:PUB00089804]]. In arctic yeast Leucosporidium sp, LeIBP, an ice-binding protein, can lower the freezing point below the melting point once it binds to ice [[cite:PUB00058444]]. The 3D structure of these proteins is a discontinuous β-solenoid with a triangular cross-section and an adjacent α-helix [[cite:PUB00094907], [cite:PUB00094908]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4nuh", "name" "Crystal structure of mLeIBP, a capping head region swapped mutant of ice-binding protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11999" "Ice-binding-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ice-binding protein", "short" "Ice-bd_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 286, "proteomes" 698, "taxa" 3896, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4722, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4487, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3312}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021884", :literature {"PUB00089804" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Do H" "Kim SJ" "Kim HJ" "Lee JH."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
