{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Polyamines such as spermidine and spermine are essential for cellular growth under most conditions, being implicated in a large number of cellular processes including DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) plays an essential regulatory role in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway by generating the n-propylamine residue required for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine from putrescein [[cite:PUB00035745], [cite:PUB00035746]]. Unlike many amino acid decarboxylases AdoMetDC uses a covalently bound pyruvate residue as a cofactor rather than the more common pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. These proteins can be divided into two main groups which show little sequence similarity either to each other, or to other pyruvoyl-dependent amino acid decarboxylases: class I enzymes found in bacteria and archaea, and class II enzymes found in eukaryotes. In both groups the active enzyme is generated by the post-translational autocatalytic cleavage of a precursor protein. This cleavage generates the pyruvate precursor from an internal serine residue and results in the formation of two non-identical subunits termed alpha and beta which form the active enzyme [[cite:PUB00019108], [cite:PUB00019109]].</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents the prokaryotic AdoMetDC family, which includes S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase proenzymes [[cite:PUB00064852]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1tlu", "name" "Crystal Structure of Thermotoga maritima S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016067", "name" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042284", "name" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042286", "name" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33866" "S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE DECARBOXYLASE PROENZYME"}, "pfam" {"PF02675" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase family, prokaryotic", "short" "AdoMetDC_fam_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 55, "proteomes" 3234, "taxa" 15406, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17918, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17823, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13804}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0641", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0641"} {"accession" "GenProp1571", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1571"} {"accession" "GenProp1596", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1596"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
