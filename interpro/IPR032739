{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is found in eukaryotes and includes MRN complex-interacting protein (MRNIP), which plays a role in preventing the accumulation of damaged DNA in cells.   It associates with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) damage-sensing complex and is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA damage.
