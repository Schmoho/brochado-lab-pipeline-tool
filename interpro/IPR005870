{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes subunit IV of the cytochrome b6/f complex. The cyt b6/f complex is central to the functions of oxygenic photosynthetic electron transport in cyanobacteria and its equivalents in algae and higher plants, mediating electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) reaction centre complexes. The cyt b6f complex consists of a cytochrome b core, in addition to cytochrome f, Rieske 2Fe-2S, and subunits IV, V, VI, VII. The complex has a central quinone exchange cavity, which is defined by two monomers that resemble the respiratory cytochrome bc1 complex [[cite:PUB00034763]]. Cyt b6f has three prosthetic groups not found in cytbc1: chlorophyll-a, beta-carotene and a structurally unique covalently bound haem. The haem is thought to function in cyclic electron transport via anionic ferredoxin. Each monomer of the complex contains a molecule of chlorophyll-a and beta-carotene. Subunit IV is one of the principal subunits for the binding of the redox prosthetic groups.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9es7", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of Spinacia oleracea cytochrome b6f complex with water molecules at 1.94 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036150", "name" "Cytochrome b/b6, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01344" "Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 4 [petD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01156" "cytochrome b6-f complex subunit IV"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000033" "Cytochrome b6-f complex, subunit IV"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b6/f complex, subunit IV", "short" "Cyt_b6/f_cplx_suIV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 325, "taxa" 21090, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14980, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14961, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11852}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1353", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1353"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005870", :literature {"PUB00034763" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Cramer WA" "Zhang H" "Yan J" "Kurisu G" "Smith JL."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
