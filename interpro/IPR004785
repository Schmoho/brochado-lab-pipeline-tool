{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.6]) forms a homodimer and catalyses the interconversion of D-ribose 5-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. This reaction permits the synthesis of ribose from other sugars, as well as the recycling of sugars from nucleotide breakdown. Two unrelated enzymes can catalyse this reaction: RpiA (found in most organisms) and RpiB (found in some bacteria and eukaryotes). RpiB is also involved in metabolism of the rare sugar, allose, in addition to ribose sugars. The structures of RpiA and RpiB are distinct, RpiB having a Rossmann-type α/β/α sandwich topology [[cite:PUB00029142]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the RpiB enzyme. It also includes D-erythrulose-4-phosphate isomerase from Pectobacterium atrosepticum [[cite:PUB00091681]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3he8", "name" "Structural study of Clostridium thermocellum Ribose-5-Phosphate Isomerase B"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036569", "name" "Sugar-phosphate isomerase, RpiB/LacA/LacB superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01120" "ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B", "short" "RpiB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3858, "taxa" 16177, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20165, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20165, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15265}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"} {"accession" "GenProp1438", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1438"} {"accession" "GenProp1294", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1294"} {"accession" "GenProp1463", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1463"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
