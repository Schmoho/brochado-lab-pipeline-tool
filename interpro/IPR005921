{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Histidine ammonia-lyase deaminates histidine to urocanic acid, the first step in histidine degradation. It is closely related to the plant enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase [[cite:PUB00023551]] but is absent in plants and viruses. This enzyme contains a unique cofactor called 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one group (MIO), which is produced autocatalytically by a cyclization and dehydration of the three amino-acid residues alanine, serine and glycine, for its chain folding [[cite:PUB00021475]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1gkm", "name" "HISTIDINE AMMONIA-LYASE (HAL) FROM PSEUDOMONAS PUTIDA INHIBITED WITH L-CYSTEINE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008948", "name" "L-Aspartase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00229" "Histidine ammonia-lyase [hutH]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01225" "histidine ammonia-lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine ammonia-lyase", "short" "HutH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5051, "taxa" 20338, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16219}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1619", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1619"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
