{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This peptide has six cysteines involved in three disulphide bonds.\r\nThe presence of a 'disulphide through disulphide knot' structurally defines this protein as a knottin:  the peptide contains a global fold which involves a cysteine-knotted three-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet along with a flexible loop and four beta-reverse turns. It also has an amphiphilic character which is the main structural basis of its biological function [[cite:PUB00013263]].
