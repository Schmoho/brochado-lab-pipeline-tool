{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (BRCA2) is a breast tumour suppressor involved in double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination [[cite:PUB00027524]]. BRCA2 gene expression is regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner and peak expression of BRCA2 mRNA occurring in S phase, suggesting BRCA2 may participate in regulating cell proliferation. BRCA2, and related protein BRCA1, have transcriptional activation potential and the two proteins are associated with the activation of double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination. The two proteins have been shown to coexist and colocalize in a biochemical complex. BRCA2 has a number of 39 amino acid repeats [[cite:PUB00003901]] that are critical for binding to RAD51 (a key protein in DNA recombinational repair) and resistance to methyl methanesulphonate treatment [[cite:PUB00005803], [cite:PUB00005815], [cite:PUB00005834]]. There are eight repeats in BRCA2 designated as BRC1 to BRC8. BRC1, BRC2, BRC3, BRC4, BRC7, and BRC8 have high sequence identity and bind to Rad51, whereas BRC5 and BRC6 are less well conserved and are unable to bind Rad51 [[cite:PUB00007172]]. It has been suggested that BRCA2 plays a role in positioning Rad51 at the site of DNA repair or in removing Rad51 from DNA once repair has been completed.</p>\n\n<p>Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been linked to an elevated risk of young onset breast cancer and confer a high risk of the disease through a dominantly inherited fashion [[cite:PUB00066909]]. BRCA2 mutations are typically microdeletions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homologues exist in plants: the BRCA2A and BRCA2B proteins from<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>are required for repair of breaks in double-stranded DNA and homologous recombination and in the prophase stage of meiosis are required for formation of RAD51 and DMC1 foci in males [[cite:PUB00085103]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036315", "name" "BRCA2 helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002397" "DNA recombination repair protein, BRCA2 type"}, "panther" {"PTHR11289" "BREAST CANCER TYPE 2 SUSCEPTIBILITY PROTEIN BRCA2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein", "short" "BRCA2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1580, "taxa" 6497, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5358, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4276, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1462}, "pathways" 24}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015525", :literature {"PUB00027524" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6913", "authors" ["Pellegrini L" "Yu DS" "Lo T" "Anand S" "Lee M" "Blundell TL" "Venkitaraman AR."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01230", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Insights into DNA recombination from the structure of a RAD51-BRCA2 complex.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "287-93", "volume" "420", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12442171}, "PUB00066909" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Walker LC" "Whiley PJ" "Couch FJ" "Farrugia DJ" "Healey S" "Eccles DM" "Lin F" "Butler SA" "Goff SA" "Thompson BA" "Lakhani SR" "Da Silva LM; kConFab Investigators" "Tavtigian SV" "Goldgar DE" "Brown MA" "Spurdle AB."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
