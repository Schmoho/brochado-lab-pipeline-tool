{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins (PPRs) part of the plant combinatorial and modular protein (PCMP) family, including At4g14850, At3g57430, At3g11460 and CRR2. The PPR proteins have been proposed to contact the RNA sequence with selected repeats at specific nucleotides [[cite:PUB00098282], [cite:PUB00103556]]. At4g14850, also known as Lovastatin insensitive 1, plays regulatory roles in cytosolic and plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis through RNA editing [[cite:PUB00098279]]. At3g57430 also acts as a RNA editing factor in chloroplasts [[cite:PUB00098280]]. At3g11460, also known as MEF10, is required for RNA editing in mitochondria [[cite:PUB00098281]]. CRR2 is required for the intergenic processing between chloroplast rsp7 and ndhB transcripts [[cite:PUB00103557]] and it is necessary for chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex-dependent cyclic electron transport around photosystem I [[cite:PUB00103558]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes At1g15510, At3g16610 and At2g39620.
