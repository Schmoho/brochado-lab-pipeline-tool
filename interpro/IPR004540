{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Translation elongation factors are responsible for two main processes during protein synthesis on the ribosome [[cite:PUB00033953], [cite:PUB00033952], [cite:PUB00033951]].  EF1A (or EF-Tu) is responsible for the selection and binding of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site (acceptor site) of the ribosome. EF2 (or EF-G) is responsible for the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome, thereby freeing the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA to bind. Elongation factors are responsible for achieving accuracy of translation and both EF1A and EF2 are remarkably conserved throughout evolution.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>EF-G is a large, five-domain GTPase that promotes the directional movement of mRNA and tRNAs on the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Unlike other GTPases, but by analogy to the myosin motor, EF-G performs its function of powering translocation in the GDP-bound form; that is, in a kinetically stable ribosome-EF-G(GDP) complex formed by GTP hydrolysis on the ribosome. The complex undergoes an extensive structural rearrangement, in particular affecting the small ribosomal subunit, which leads to mRNA-tRNA movement. Domain 4, which extends from the 'body' of the EF-G molecule much like a lever arm, appears to be essential for the structural transition to take place. In a hypothetical model, GTP hydrolysis induces a conformational change in the G domain of EF-G, which affects the interactions with neighbouring domains within EF-G. The resulting rearrangement of the domains relative to each other generates conformational strain in the ribosome to which EF-G is fixed. Because of structural features of the tRNA-ribosome complex, this conformational strain results in directional tRNA-mRNA movement. The functional parallels between EF-G and motor proteins suggest that EF-G differs from classical G-proteins in that it functions as a force-generating mechanochemical device rather than a conformational switch [[cite:PUB00014828]].</p>\r\n<p>Every completed bacterial genome has at least one copy, but some species have additional EF-G-like proteins. The closest homologue to canonical (e.g. Escherichia coli) EF-G in the spirochetes clusters as if it is derived from mitochondrial forms, while a more distant second copy is also present. Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803)\r\nhas a few proteins more closely related to EF-G than to any other characterised protein. Two of these resemble E. coli EF-G more closely than does the best match from the spirochetes; it may be that both function as authentic EF-G.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5tv2", "name" "Crystal structure of a fragment (1-405) of an elongation factor G from Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00054_B" "Elongation factor G [fusA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00484" "elongation factor G"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translation elongation factor EFG/EF2", "short" "Transl_elong_EFG/EF2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 89, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11593, "taxa" 44481, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 54231, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54230, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 41067}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0741", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0741"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
