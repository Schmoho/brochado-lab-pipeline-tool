{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The complete DNA sequence of the genome of Vaccinia virus has been determined [[cite:PUB00008084]]. 198 \"major\" protein-coding regions and 65 overlapping \"minor\" regions have been identified, with a total of 263 potential genes. The genes are compactly organised along the genome, with few noncoding regions [[cite:PUB00008084]]. The function of the majority of proteins encoded by these open reading frames is so far undetermined.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from poxvirus, including the D9 protein from Vaccinia virus (also known as mRNA-decapping protein OPG121), a decapping Nudix enzyme that accelerates viral and cellular mRNA turnover to eliminate competing host mRNAs and allow stage-specific synthesis of viral proteins, being critical for poxvirus pathogenicity. Acceleration of the turnover of cellular transcripts may even promote the shutoff of host protein synthesis. This enzyme shows a domain organization in which a three-helix bundle is inserted into the catalytic Nudix domain [[cite:PUB00103561], [cite:PUB00103562]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7sez", "name" "Crystal structure of Vaccinia Virus decapping enzyme D9 in complex with m7GDP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01363" "VD09PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral protein D9", "short" "Viral_VD9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 135, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 867, "sets" 0, "proteins" 121, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
