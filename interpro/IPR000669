{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mannitol dehydrogenases catalyse the NAD-dependent reduction of mannitol-1-phosphates as part of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS facilitates the vectorial translocation of metabolisable carbohydrates to form the corresponding sugar phosphates, which are then converted to glycolytic intermediates [[cite:PUB00002028]]. Mannitol 2-dehydrogenase catalyses the NAD-dependent reduction of mannitol to fructose [[cite:PUB00003120]].\r\nSeveral dehydrogenases have been shown [[cite:PUB00003120]] to be evolutionary related, including mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.17]) (gene mtlD), mannitol 2-dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.67]) (gene mtlK); mannonate oxidoreductase ([ec:1.1.1.57]) (fructuronate reductase) (gene uxuB); Escherichia coli hypothetical proteins ydfI and yeiQ; and yeast hypothetical protein YEL070w.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00084" "MTLDHDRGNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mannitol dehydrogenase", "short" "Mannitol_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4220, "taxa" 15996, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 91403, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23535, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18297}, "pathways" 149}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00751", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00751"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
