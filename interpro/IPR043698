{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The short peptides that forms cross-links between glycan chains in the peptidoglycan polymer in bacterial cell walls require d-amino acids (DAA), being d-Alanine and d-Glutamate the most predominant ones. DAA are generated from the l-enantiomers by specific alanine and glutamate racemases. However, diverse bacteria can produce non-canonical DAA (NCDAA) components of the cell wall, that relies on periplasmic broad-spectrum racemases (Bsr) activity. Lysine racemase is another enzyme present in some organisms and catalyses the conversion of l-Lys to d-Lys but it also can use l-Arg as substrate. Together with Bsr they are classified as Group III racemases [[cite:PUB00065134]]. These NCDAA are involved in different cellular processes including biofilm stability, sporulation and cell communication and allow pathogenic bacteria to adapt in adverse environments [[cite:PUB00094474]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4dza", "name" "Crystal structure of a lysine racemase within internal aldimine linkage"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009006", "name" "Alanine racemase/group IV decarboxylase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR029066", "name" "PLP-binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02212" "Broad specificity amino-acid racemase"}, "cdd" {"cd06826" "Type III Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-Dependent Enzyme, Alanine Racemase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Racemase Bsr/Lyr", "short" "Racemase_Bsr/Lyr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 657, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 674, "sets" 0, "proteins" 674, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 457}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
