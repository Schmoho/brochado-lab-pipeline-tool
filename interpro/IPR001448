{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP or ASSP) are proteins bound to the spore DNA of bacteria of the genera Bacillus, Thermoactynomycetes, and Clostridium [[cite:PUB00000113], [cite:PUB00002172]]. They are double-stranded DNA-binding proteins that cause DNA to change to an A-like conformation. They protect the DNA backbone from chemical and enzymatic cleavage and are thus involved in dormant spore's high resistance to UV light. SASP are degraded in the first minutes of spore germination and provide amino acids for both new protein synthesis and metabolism.</p>\n\n<p>There are two distinct families of SASP: the α/β type and the gamma-type. Alpha/beta SASP are small proteins of about sixty to seventy amino acid residues that are generally coded by a multigene family. The N terminus of alpha/beta SASP contains the site which is cleaved by a SASP-specific protease that acts during germination while the C terminus and is probably involved in DNA-binding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038300", "name" "SASP, alpha/beta-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00269" "Small, acid-soluble spore proteins, alpha/beta type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small acid-soluble spore protein, alpha/beta-type", "short" "SASP_alpha/beta-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 1178, "taxa" 3774, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13166, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9700}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00276", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00276"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001448", :literature {"PUB00000113" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Setlow P."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
