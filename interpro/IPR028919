{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a variety of movement proteins (MP)s. The MP is necessary for the initial cell-to-cell movement during the early stages of a viral infection. This movement is active, and it is known that the MP interacts with the plasmodesmata and possesses the ability to bind to RNA to achieve its role [[cite:PUB00005584]]. It has been suggested in cauliflower mosaic virus that these proteins mediated viral movement by modifying plasmodesmata and forming tubules in the channel that can accommodate the virus particles [[cite:PUB00003166]]. The family contains a conserved DXR motif that is probably functionally important.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01107" "Viral movement protein (MP)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral movement protein", "short" "Viral_movement"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 154, "proteomes" 212, "taxa" 989, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4635, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4615, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 700}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
