{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents ribosomal RNA-processing protein 12 (RRP12) proteins, members of pre-ribosome-associated HEAT repeats-containing proteins [[cite:PUB00016366], [cite:PUB00101821], [cite:PUB00101822]]. They are involved in the maturation and nuclear export of both pre-40S and pre-60S ribosomal subunits. Members are required for the processing of RNA components within pre-ribosomes, which is a critical step in the assembly of functional ribosomes. The proteins in this family are associated with the late maturation of the 18S and 5.8S rRNA of the pre-40S ribosomes and for maturation of the 25S and 5.8S rRNA of the pre-60S ribosomes [[cite:PUB00101821], [cite:PUB00101822]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48287" "ARM REPEAT SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal RNA-processing protein RRP12", "short" "RRP12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2316, "taxa" 7844, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4349, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4349, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1690}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052087", :literature {"PUB00101821" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Oeffinger M" "Dlakic M" "Tollervey D."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "A pre-ribosome-associated HEAT-repeat protein is required for export of both ribosomal subunits.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "196-209", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14729571}, "PUB00101822" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7709", "authors" ["Ameismeier M" "Cheng J" "Berninghausen O" "Beckmann R."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Visualizing late states of human 40S ribosomal subunit maturation.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "249-253", "volume" "558", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29875412}, "PUB00016366" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Staub E" "Fiziev P" "Rosenthal A" "Hinzmann B."], "ISO_journal" "Bioessays", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.20032", "medline_journal" "Bioessays", "title" "Insights into the evolution of the nucleolus by an analysis of its protein domain repertoire.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "567-81", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15112237}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR052087", "name" "Ribosomal RNA-processing protein RRP12", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
