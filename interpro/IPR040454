{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) is a multisubunit DNA binding factor that serves as a dynamic platform for assembly of pre-initiation complexes on class III genes. This entry represents subunit  Tfc1/Sfc1 (also known as the tau 95 subunit) which holds a key position in TFIIIC, exerting both upstream and downstream influence on the TFIIIC-DNA complex by rendering the complex more stable [[cite:PUB00045150]]. Once bound to tDNA-intragenic promoter elements, TFIIIC directs the assembly of TFIIIB on the DNA, which in turn recruits the RNA polymerase III (pol III) and activates multiple rounds of transcription.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4bji", "name" "Sfc1-DBD"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042536", "name" "TFIIIC, subcomplex tauA subunit Sfc1, triple barrel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13230" "GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IIIC, POLYPEPTIDE 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor IIIC subunit Tfc1/Sfc1", "short" "TF_IIIC_Tfc1/Sfc1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2543, "taxa" 8528, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4656, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4656, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3050}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040454", :literature {"PUB00045150" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Jourdain S" "Acker J" "Ducrot C" "Sentenac A" "Lefebvre O."], "ISO_journal" "J.
