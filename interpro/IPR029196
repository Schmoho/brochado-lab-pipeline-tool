{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the HUWE1-associated protein modifying stress responses (HAPSTR1), also known as telomere attrition and p53 response 1 protein (TAPR1) from eukaryotes, including TAPR1 from human, which is a key multi stress-responsive protein that functions as a negative regulator of TP53/P53 in the cellular response to telomere erosion and probably also DNA damage. It functions in cooperation with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 which also promotes TAPR1's degradation [[cite:PUB00100199], [cite:PUB00101217], [cite:PUB00103900]]. HAPSTR2 plays a central regulatory role in the cellular response to molecular stressors, such as DNA damage, nutrient scarcity, and protein misfolding together with HAPSTR1 [[cite:PUB00103900]] by stabilizing HAPSTR1, but also independently of HAPSTR1. This family also includes the uncharacterised proteins from fungi, such as YJR056C from yeast.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15251" "Telomere attrition and p53 response 1 protein-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HUWE1-associated protein modifying stress responses-like", "short" "HAPSTR1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 1393, "taxa" 4973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2563, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2538, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1690}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029196", :literature {"PUB00100199" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Benslimane Y" "Sanchez-Osuna M" "Coulombe-Huntington J" "Bertomeu T" "Henry D" "Huard C" "Bonneil E" "Thibault P" "Tyers M" "Harrington L."], "ISO_journal" "Aging Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Aging Cell", "title" "A novel p53 regulator, C16ORF72/TAPR1, buffers against telomerase inhibition.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e13331", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33660365}, "PUB00101217" {"URL" nil, "issue" "27", "authors" ["Amici DR" "Ansel DJ" "Metz KA" "Smith RS" "Phoumyvong CM" "Gayatri S" "Chamera T" "Edwards SL" "O'Hara BP" "Srivastava S" "Brockway S" "Takagishi SR" "Cho BK" "Goo YA" "Kelleher NL" "Ben-Sahra I" "Foltz DR" "Li J" "Mendillo ML."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "C16orf72/HAPSTR1 is a molecular rheostat in an integrated network of stress response pathways.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e2111262119", "volume" "119", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35776542}, "PUB00103900" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Amici DR" "Cingoz H" "Alasady MJ" "Alhayek S" "Phoumyvong CM" "Sahni N" "Yi SS" "Mendillo ML."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "The HAPSTR2 retrogene buffers stress signaling and resilience in mammals.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "152", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36631436}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029196", "name" "HUWE1-associated protein modifying stress responses-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR040308", "name" "HUWE1-associated protein modifying stress responses", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 1648}}}
