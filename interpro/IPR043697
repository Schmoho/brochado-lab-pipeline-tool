{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins mainly from Proteobacteria, including ArgE' from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. ArgE' is involved in arginine biosynthesis. It catalyses the deacetylation of N-acetyl-L-citrulline to produce L-citrulline [[cite:PUB00094471], [cite:PUB00094470]]. Interestingly, it Is also able to catalyse the deacetylation of N-acetylornithine in vitro, with almost equal velocity. However, this reaction may be not relevant in vivo since Xanthomonas does not possess the canonical argF gene and cannot convert ornithine to citrulline via ArgF' [[cite:PUB00094470]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2f7v", "name" "Structure of acetylcitrulline deacetylase complexed with one Co"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02236" "N-acetyl-L-citrulline deacetylase [argE']"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetyl-L-citrulline deacetylase ArgE'-like", "short" "ACDase_ArgE'-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 139, "taxa" 568, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 529, "sets" 0, "proteins" 529, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 393}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
