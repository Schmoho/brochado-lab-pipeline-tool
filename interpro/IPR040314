{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dop1 is the founding member of the Dopey family and is required for correct cell morphology and spatiotemporal organisation of multicellular structures in the filamentous fungus Emericella nidulans (Aspergillus nidulans) [[cite:PUB00009850]]. Dop1 homologues are found in mammals, where they may play a role in regulating membrane trafficking of cargo proteins. Together with ATP9A and MON2, it regulates SNX3 retromer-mediated endosomal sorting of WLS away from lysosomal degradation [[cite:PUB00155030]]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dop1 is essential for viability and, affects cellular morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00009850]].  Loss of Dop1 activity affects endosome to Golgi transport and causes a severe perturbation of the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum; Mon2, a relative of large Arf exchange factors, recruits Dop1 to the Golgi apparatus [[cite:PUB00068242]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14042" "DOPEY-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein DOP1", "short" "DOP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2252, "taxa" 7766, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6559, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6559, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1026}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040314", :literature {"PUB00068242" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Gillingham AK" "Whyte JR" "Panic B" "Munro S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
