{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3-dehydroquinate dehydratase ([ec:4.2.1.10]), or dehydroquinase, catalyzes the conversion of 3-dehydroquinate into 3-dehydroshikimate. It is the third step in the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids from chorismate. Two classes of dehydroquinases exist, known as types I and II. The best studied type I enzyme is from Escherichia coli (gene aroD) and related bacteria where it is a homodimeric protein. In fungi, dehydroquinase is part of a multifunctional enzyme which catalyses five consecutive steps in the shikimate pathway. A histidine [[cite:PUB00002745]] is involved in the catalytic mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, type I, either as a monofunctional protein or as a domain of a larger, multifunctional protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b2a", "name" "Crystal structure of type I dehydroquinase from Salmonella typhi inhibited by an epoxide derivative"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01093" "type I 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase"}, "cdd" {"cd00502" "Type I 3-dehydroquinase, (3-dehydroquinate dehydratase or DHQase)"}, "hamap" {"MF_00214" "3-dehydroquinate dehydratase [aroD]"}, "pfam" {"PF01487" "Type I 3-dehydroquinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-dehydroquinate dehydratase type I", "short" "DHquinase_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 264, "proteomes" 3158, "taxa" 13337, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17093, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17049, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11108}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00788", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00788"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1478", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1478"} {"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"} {"accession" "GenProp1731", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1731"} {"accession" "GenProp1643", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1643"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
