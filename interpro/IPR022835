{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Chaperone modulatory protein CbpM from Escherichia coli and similar proteins from Gammaproteobacteria. CbpM (named after \"CbpA modulator\", [[cite:PUB00100096]]) interacts with the N-terminal J-domain of CbpA, forms a stable complex and specifically inhibits its activity [[cite:PUB00100097], [cite:PUB00100098]]. Together with CbpA, it modulates the activity of the DnaK chaperone system [[cite:PUB00100094]]. It does not inhibit the co-chaperone activity of DnaJ. The crystal structure of CbpM shows similarity to members of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators [[cite:PUB00100098]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01155" "Chaperone modulatory protein CbpM [cbpM]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperone modulatory protein CbpM", "short" "CbpM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 592, "sets" 0, "proteins" 592, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 484}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022835", :literature {"PUB00100096" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Chae C" "Sharma S" "Hoskins JR" "Wickner S."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "CbpA, a DnaJ homolog, is a DnaK co-chaperone, and its activity is modulated by CbpM.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "33147-53", "volume" "279", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15184371}, "PUB00100098" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sarraf NS" "Shi R" "McDonald L" "Baardsnes J" "Zhang L" "Cygler M" "Ekiel I."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Structure of CbpA J-domain bound to the regulatory protein Cbpm explains its specificity and suggests evolutionary link between Cbpm and transcriptional regulators.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e100441", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24945826}, "PUB00100097" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Chenoweth MR" "Trun N" "Wickner S."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "In vivo modulation of a DnaJ homolog, CbpA, by CbpM.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "3635-8", "volume" "189", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17337578}, "PUB00100094" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sarraf NS" "Baardsnes J" "Cheng J" "O'Connor-McCourt M" "Cygler M" "Ekiel I."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Structural basis of the regulation of the CbpA co-chaperone by its specific modulator CbpM.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "111-21", "volume" "398", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20226195}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022835", "name" "Chaperone modulatory protein CbpM", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
