{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of glycine cleavage H-proteins, part of the glycine cleavage system (GCS) found in bacteria, archaea, and the mitochondria of eukaryotes. GCS is a multienzyme complex consisting of 4 different components (P-, H-, T- and L-proteins) which catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of glycine [[cite:PUB00063633]]. The H-protein shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P-protein (glycine dehydrogenase) to the T-protein (aminomethyltransferase) via a lipoyl group, attached to a completely conserved lysine residue [[cite:PUB00004842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the glycine cleavage system H protein.
