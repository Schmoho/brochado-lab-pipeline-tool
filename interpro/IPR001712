{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Flagellar/Hr/Invasion Proteins Export Pore (FHIPEP) family [[cite:PUB00002235], [cite:PUB00003759]] consists of a number of proteins that constitute the type III secretion (or signal peptide-independent) pathway apparatus [[cite:PUB00005523], [cite:PUB00002179]]. This mechanism translocates proteins lacking an N-terminal signal peptide across the cell membrane in one step, as it does not require an intermediate periplasmic process to cleave the signal peptide. It is a common pathway amongst Gram-negative bacteria for secreting toxic and flagellar proteins.</p>\r\n<p>The pathway apparatus comprises three components: two within the inner membrane and one within the outer [[cite:PUB00003759]]. An FHIPEP protein is located within the inner membrane, although it is unknown which component it constitutes. FHIPEP proteins have all about 700 amino-acid residues. Within the sequence, the N terminus is highly conserved and hydrophobic, suggesting that this terminus is embedded within the membrane, with 6-8 transmembrane (TM) domains, while the C terminus is less conserved and appears to be devoid of TM regions. It is possible that members of the FHIPEP family serve as pores for the export of specific proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characterized proteins from the FHIPEP family include: the flagellar biosynthesis protein FlhA which is required for formation of the rod structure of the flagellar apparatus [[cite:PUB00002258]]; and the secretion system apparatus protein SsaV from<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>which is required for the secretion of the SpvB toxin [[cite:PUB00085104]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2x49", "name" "Crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of InvA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042193", "name" "FHIPEP, domain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042196", "name" "FHIPEP, domain 4", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042194", "name" "FHIPEP, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005419" "Type III secretion apparatus inner membrane protein, FlhA type"}, "panther" {"PTHR30161" "FLAGELLAR EXPORT PROTEIN, MEMBRANE FLHA SUBUNIT-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF00771" "FHIPEP family"}, "prints" {"PR00949" "TYPE3IMAPROT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system FHIPEP", "short" "T3SS_FHIPEP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 54, "proteomes" 4562, "taxa" 18105, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26951, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26488, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20473}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00763", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00763"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001712", :literature {"PUB00002235" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Wei ZM" "Beer SV."], "ISO_journal" "J.
