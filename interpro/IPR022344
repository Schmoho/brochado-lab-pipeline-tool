{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gene transfer agents belong to a group of unusual genetic exchange elements [[cite:PUB00055430]].  GTAs are unusual in the sense they have the structure of a small tailed phage, which do not possess typical phage traits such as host cell lysis and infectious transmission of the GTA genes. In the Rhodobacter capsulatus GTA the GTA particles contain random 4.5 kb DNA fragments of the R.capsulatus genome.
