{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family have been characterised in plants and named STELLO. STELLO1 and 2 from Arabidopsis are Golgi-localized proteins that can interact with cellulose synthase CesA and control cellulose quantity. Cellulose is produced at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CesA) complexes (CSCs), which are assembled in the endomembrane system and trafficked to the plasma membrane. STELLO1 and 2 are though to regulate CSC assembly in the plant Golgi apparatus. Point mutations in the predicted catalytic domains of the STELLO proteins indicate that they are glycosyltransferases facing the Golgi lumen [[cite:PUB00081895]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of the metazoan members of this family is not known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7xpt", "name" "Crystal structrue of MtdL:GDP:Mn soaked with GDP-Glc"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31362" "GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE STELLO1-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03385" "STELLO glycosyltransferases"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "STELLO-like", "short" "STL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 492, "taxa" 2525, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2585, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2462, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1653}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005049", :literature {"PUB00081895" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Nikolovski N" "Sorieul M" "Vellosillo T" "McFarlane HE" "Dupree R" "Kesten C" "Schneider R" "Driemeier C" "Lathe R" "Lampugnani E" "Yu X" "Ivakov A" "Doblin MS" "Mortimer JC" "Brown SP" "Persson S" "Dupree P."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11656", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Golgi-localized STELLO proteins regulate the assembly and trafficking of cellulose synthase complexes in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "11656", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27277162}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005049", "name" "STELLO-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 916}}}
