{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family are now designated CbbX. Some previously were CfxQ (carbon fixation Q). Its gene is often found immmediately downstream of the Rubisco large and small chain genes, and it is suggested to be necessary for Rubisco expression. CbbX has been shown to be necessary for photoautotrophic growth. The Cfx genes in Ralstonia eutropha (Alcaligenes eutrophus) encode a number of Calvin cycle enzymes [[cite:PUB00002204]]. The observed sizes of two of the gene products, CfxX and CfxY,\r\nare 35kDa and 27kDa respectively [[cite:PUB00002204]]. No functions could be assigned to\r\nCfxX and CfxY. These proteins show a high degree of similarity to the\r\nBacillus subtilis stage V sporulation protein K [[cite:PUB00003809]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02880" "CbbX protein"}, "prints" {"PR00820" "CBXXCFQX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CbxX/CfxQ, monofunctional", "short" "CbxX/CfqX_mono"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 602, "taxa" 3664, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5503, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2553, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2023}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000470", :literature {"PUB00002204" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Kusian B" "Yoo JG" "Bednarski R" "Bowien B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
