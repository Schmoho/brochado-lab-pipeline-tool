{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes human AK17A and its orthologue from mouse, AK17B. AK17A was originally reported as the pseudoautosomal or X inactivation escape gene 7 (XE7) and as B-lymphocyte antigen precursor [[cite:PUB00083330]]. It has been suggested that AKAP-17A is an alternative splicing factor and an SR-related splicing protein that interacts with the classical SR protein ASF/SF2 and the SR-related factor ZNF265 [[cite:PUB00083331]]. Additional studies have indicated that AKAP-17A is a dual-specific protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) that can bind both type I and type II protein kinase A (PKA) with high affinity and co-localizes with the catalytic subunit of PKA in nuclear speckles as well as the splicing factor SC35 in splicing factor compartments. It is involved in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing possibly by docking a pool of PKA in splicing factor compartments [[cite:PUB00083332]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12484" "B-LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "A-kinase anchor protein 17A/B", "short" "AK17A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1208, "taxa" 4785, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2675, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2675, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1753}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056852", :literature {"PUB00083330" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Ellison JW" "Ramos C" "Yen PH" "Shapiro LJ."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
