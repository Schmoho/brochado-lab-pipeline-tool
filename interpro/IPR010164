{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ornithine aminotransferase catalyses the conversion of L-ornithine and a 2-oxo acid to L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and an L-amino acid. This enzyme is found in low-GC bacteria, where it is responsible for the fourth step in arginine biosynthesis, and in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotes, where it controls L-ornithine levels in tissues. In human hereditary ornithine aminotransferase deficiency, the elevated levels of intraocular concentrations of ornithine are responsible for gyrate atrophy, which affects the CNS and peripheral nervous system [[cite:PUB00014863]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8v9m", "name" "Human Ornithine Aminotransferase cocrystallized with its inhibitor, (R)-3-amino-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01885" "ornithine--oxo-acid transaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ornithine aminotransferase", "short" "Orn_aminotrans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5279, "taxa" 18267, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14840, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14818, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10768}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1428", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1428"} {"accession" "GenProp1472", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1472"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
