{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains proteins of up to five transmembranes helices found in bacterial species, some of which carry a nested PepSY domain. Coil residues are significantly more conserved than other residues and are frequently found within channels and transporters, where they introduce the flexibility and polarity required for transport across the membrane [[cite:PUB00043398]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PepSY (peptidase (M4) and YpeB of subtilis) is a repeated region first identified in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. The PepSY domain functions in the control of M4 peptidases through their propeptide and in the germination of spores. It may also play a part in regulating protease activity [[cite:PUB00020015]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34219" "IRON-REGULATED INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03929" "PepSY-associated TM region"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PepSY-associated TM protein", "short" "PepSY-ass_TM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 73, "proteomes" 4157, "taxa" 16199, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38310, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38073, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30135}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005625", :literature {"PUB00043398" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kauko A" "Illergard K" "Elofsson A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
