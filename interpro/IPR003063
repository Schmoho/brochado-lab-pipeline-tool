{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The cloacin immunity protein complexes with cloacin in equimolar quantities and inhibits it by binding with high affinity to the cloacin C-terminal catalytic domain. The immunity protein is relatively small, containing 85 amino acids.</p>\n\n<p>An extra ribosome binding site has been found to precede the immunity gene on the polycistronic Clo DF13 mRNA [[cite:PUB00006228]], which perhaps accounts for the fact that, in cloacinogenic cells, more immunity protein than cloacin is synthesised [[cite:PUB00006228]]. Comparison of the complete amino acid sequence of the Clo DF13 immunity protein with that of the Col E3 and Col E6 immunity proteins reveals extensive similarities in primary structure, although Col E3 and Clo DF13 immunity proteins are exchangeable only to a low extent<i>in vivo</i>and<i>in vitro</i>[[cite:PUB00006228]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3eip", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF COLICIN E3 IMMUNITY PROTEIN: AN INHIBITOR TO A RIBOSOME-INACTIVATING RNASE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036528", "name" "Cloacin immunity protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03513" "Cloacin immunity protein"}, "prints" {"PR01296" "CLOACNIMMNTY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cloacin immunity protein family", "short" "Cloacn_immnty_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 15, "taxa" 296, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 366, "sets" 0, "proteins" 366, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 285}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003063", :literature {"PUB00006228" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["van den Elzen PJ" "Gaastra W" "Spelt CE" "de Graaf FK" "Veltkamp E" "Nijkamp HJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/8.19.4349", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Molecular structure of the immunity gene and immunity protein of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid Clo DF13.", "year" 1980, "raw_pages" "4349-63", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6253914}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015643", "name" "toxic substance binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030153", "name" "bacteriocin immunity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003063", "name" "Cloacin immunity protein family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 23}}}
