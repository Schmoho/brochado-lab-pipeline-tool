{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the binary toxin xaxAB subunit B and its homologues. Xax was discovered in entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus nematophila ([swissprot:D3VB23]) and it is a binary pore-forming toxin (α-PFT) encoded by two genes xaxA and xaxB with a maximum hemolytic activity obtained with equimolar concentrations of the two proteins [[cite:PUB00105432]].</p>\n\n<p>The toxin orthologue YaxAB from Yersinia enterocolitica ([swissprot:A1JM52]), also member of this family, was structurally characterised [[cite:PUB00105434]]. The crystal structure of YaxB shown an atypical fold, comprising a head domain reminiscent of ClyA family of α-PFTs and pronounced coiled-coil and foot domains unique to the YaxAB system. The pore complex assembled in decamer of dimers (20-mer) arrangement of its two components.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033927" "alpha-xenorhabdolysin family binary toxin subunit B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "XaxAB toxin subunit B-like", "short" "XaxB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 434, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 630, "sets" 0, "proteins" 630, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 461}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047760", :literature {"PUB00105432" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Vigneux F" "Zumbihl R" "Jubelin G" "Ribeiro C" "Poncet J" "Baghdiguian S" "Givaudan A" "Brehelin M."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The xaxAB genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "9571-9580", "volume" "282", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17229739}, "PUB00105434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Brauning B" "Bertosin E" "Praetorius F" "Ihling C" "Schatt A" "Adler A" "Richter K" "Sinz A" "Dietz H" "Groll M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structure and mechanism of the two-component α-helical pore-forming toxin YaxAB.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1806", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29728606}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047760", "name" "XaxAB toxin subunit B-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
