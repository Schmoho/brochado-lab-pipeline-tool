{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteolytic enzymes that exploit serine in their catalytic activity are ubiquitous, being found in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00003576]]. They include a wide range of peptidase activity, including exopeptidase, endopeptidase, oligopeptidase and omega-peptidase activity. Many families of serine protease have been identified, these being grouped into clans on the basis of structural similarity and other functional evidence [[cite:PUB00003576]]. Structures are known for members of the clans and the structures indicate that some appear to be totally unrelated, suggesting different evolutionary origins for the serine peptidases [[cite:PUB00003576]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not withstanding their different evolutionary origins, there are similarities in the reaction mechanisms of several peptidases. Chymotrypsin, subtilisin and carboxypeptidase C have a catalytic triad of serine, aspartate and histidine in common: serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The geometric orientations of the catalytic residues are similar between families, despite different protein folds [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The linear arrangements of the catalytic residues commonly reflect clan relationships. For example the catalytic triad in the chymotrypsin clan (PA) is ordered HDS, but is ordered DHS in the subtilisin clan (SB) and SDH in the carboxypeptidase clan (SC) [[cite:PUB00003576], [cite:PUB00000522]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family of fungal proteins is involved in the processing of membrane bound transcription factor Stp1 [[cite:PUB00016412]] and belongs to MEROPS petidase family S64 (clan PA). The processing causes the signalling domain of Stp1 to be passed to the nucleus where several permease genes are induced. The permeases are important for uptake of amino acids, and processing of tp1 only occurs in an amino acid-rich environment. This family is predicted to be distantly related to the trypsin family (MEROPS peptidase family S1) and to have a typical trypsin-like catalytic triad [[cite:PUB00016412]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08192" "Peptidase family S64"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011716" "Endoprotease, Ssy5 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S64, Ssy5", "short" "Peptidase_S64_Ssy5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 182, "taxa" 687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 387, "sets" 0, "proteins" 356, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 247}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012985", :literature {"PUB00016412" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Abdel-Sater F" "El Bakkoury M" "Urrestarazu A" "Vissers S" "Andre B."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
