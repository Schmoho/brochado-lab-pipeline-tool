The Pst system of E. coli comprises four distinct subunits encoded by the pstS, pstA, pstB, and pstC genes. The PstS protein is a phosphate-binding protein located in the periplasmic space [[cite:PUB00021096]]. PstA and PstC are hydrophobic and they form the transmembrane portion of the Pst system [[cite:PUB00062379]]. PstB is the catalytic subunit, which couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the import of phosphate across cellular membranes through the Pst system, often referred as ABC-protein. PstB belongs to one of the largest superfamilies of proteins characterized by a highly conserved adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette (ABC), which is also a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) [[cite:PUB00080861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03260" "ATP-binding cassette domain of the phosphate transport system"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00972" "phosphate ABC transporter ATP-binding protein PstB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphate import ATP-binding protein PstB-like", "short" "PstB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8363, "taxa" 32608, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44958, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44958, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34945}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0190", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0190"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
