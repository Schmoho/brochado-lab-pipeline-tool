{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 7 (ELOVL7, also known as Very long chain fatty acid elongase 7) is an enzyme of the long-chain fatty acid elongation cycle [[cite:PUB00153162]]. It is a transmembrane protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum with the active site within one of the transmembrane regions.  ELOVL7 adds two carbons per cycle to the chains of long and very long fatty acids with higher activity towards C18 acyl-CoAs. ELOVL7 has been implicated in prostate cancer growth and the gene is regulated by the androgen pathway through SREBP1 [[cite:PUB00079969]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03207" "Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 7 [ELOVL7]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 7", "short" "ELOVL7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 367, "taxa" 1422, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 525, "sets" 0, "proteins" 525, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 347}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
