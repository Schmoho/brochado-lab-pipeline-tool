{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Treponema pallidum RodA and Escherichia coli  MrdB are probable peptidoglycan polymerases that are essential for cell wall elongation [[cite:PUB00086588]]. RodA is a member of the FtsW/RodA/SpoVE family. It is found only in species with rod (or spiral) shapes. RodA is required for the maintenance of the rod cell shape and is essential for the elongation of the lateral wall of the cell [[cite:PUB00071895]]. In Escherichai coli, the rodA and pbpA genes occur in the same operon, and RodA is required for the expression of the enzymatic activity of the penicillin-binding protein 2 (PbpA) [[cite:PUB00042955]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02079" "Peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase MrdB [mrdB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02210" "rod shape-determining protein RodA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase RodA/MrdB", "short" "RodA/MrdB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5117, "taxa" 21289, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23738, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23738, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18226}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0166", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0166"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
