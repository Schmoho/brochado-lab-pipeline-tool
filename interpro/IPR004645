{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of Tfx DNA-binding proteins, which is restricted to the archaea. TfX has a 2-layer α/β topology.

Tfx from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (Methanobacterium thermoformicicum) is associated with the operon for molybdenum formyl-methanofuran dehydrogenase and binds a DNA sequence near its promoter.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036657", "name" "DNA-binding protein Tfx superfamily, archaea", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00721" "Tfx family DNA-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding protein Tfx, archaea", "short" "Tfx_DNA-bd_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 161, "taxa" 977, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 816, "sets" 0, "proteins" 816, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 702}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004645", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004645", "name" "DNA-binding protein Tfx, archaea", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR018384", "name" "DNA-binding protein Tfx, euryarchaeota", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
