{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 5-oxoprolinase subunit B from Bacillus subtilis (PxpB) and similar proteins widely spread among bacteria. PxpB was originally designated KipI, as it showed to be an inhibitor of B. subtilis sporulation kinase A (KinA) [[cite:PUB00064884]]. It catalyses the cleavage of 5-oxoproline to form L-glutamate coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. It folds into two α/β domains [[cite:PUB00088732]]. Members of this family show a carboxyltransferase domain ([interpro:IPR003833]) covering its full length.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029000", "name" "Cyclophilin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34698" "5-OXOPROLINASE SUBUNIT B"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00370" "5-oxoprolinase subunit PxpB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5-oxoprolinase subunit B", "short" "PxpB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4123, "taxa" 15851, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18745, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18741, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14544}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
