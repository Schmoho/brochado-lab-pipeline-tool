{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Neuromodulin (also known as growth-associated protein 43 or GAP-43) is a component of the motile growth cones. It is membrane protein whose expression is widely correlated with successful axon elongation [[cite:PUB00004299]]. It is a crucial component of an effective regeneration response in the nervous system [[cite:PUB00004303]]. Although its function is uncertain, the N-terminal region is well conserved and contains both a calmodulin binding domain, and sites for acylation, membrane attachment and protein kinase C phosphorylation. Structure predictions suggest that the C-terminal region may exist as an extended, negatively-charged rod with some similarity to the side arms of neurofilaments, indicating that the biological role of neuromodulin may depend on its ability to form a dynamic membrane-cytoplasm-calmodulin complex [[cite:PUB00004303]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00215" "NEUROMODULIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuromodulin (GAP-43)", "short" "Neuromodulin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 622, "taxa" 2185, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2379, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1013, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 701}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00344", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00344"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001422", :literature {"PUB00004299" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kosik KS" "Orecchio LD" "Bruns GA" "Benowitz LI" "MacDonald GP" "Cox DR" "Neve RL."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0896-6273(88)90196-1", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Human GAP-43: its deduced amino acid sequence and chromosomal localization in mouse and human.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "127-32", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3272162}, "PUB00004303" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["LaBate ME" "Skene JH."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0896-6273(89)90254-7", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Selective conservation of GAP-43 structure in vertebrate evolution.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "299-310", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2641999}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0040008", "name" "regulation of growth", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001422", "name" "Neuromodulin (GAP-43)", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
