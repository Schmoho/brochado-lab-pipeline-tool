{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Gram-negative organisms, PspA is part of the multi-gene Phage shock protein (Psp) response system that mitigates envelope damage by preventing proton leakage across a damaged membrane, thereby maintaining proton motive force  [[cite:PUB00095086]]. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PspA has been shown to integrate envelope stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions [[cite:PUB00095086]]. It also regulates lipid droplet homeostasis and nonreplicating persistence (NRP) in M. tuberculosis [[cite:PUB00095109]]. The PspA homologue in plants, inner membrane-associated protein of 30 kDa (IM30), also known as vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (VIPP1), plays a critical role in thylakoid biogenesis, essential for photosynthesis [[cite:PUB00009806]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4whe", "name" "Crystal structure of E. coli phage shock protein A (PspA 1-144)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31088" "MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN VIPP1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "pfam" {"PF04012" "PspA/IM30 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PspA/VIPP1", "short" "PspA_VIPP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 35, "proteomes" 4830, "taxa" 19126, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24901, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24864, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18930}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007157", :literature {"PUB00009806" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Elderkin S" "Jones S" "Schumacher J" "Studholme D" "Buck M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
