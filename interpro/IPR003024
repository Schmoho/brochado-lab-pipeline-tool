{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) transport mechanisms are the principal regulators of pH in animal cells. Such transport also plays a vital role in acid-base movements in the stomach, pancreas, intestine, kidney, reproductive organs and the central nervous system. Functional studies have suggested four different HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>transport modes. Anion exchanger proteins exchange HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>for Cl<sup>-</sup>in a reversible, electroneutral manner [[cite:PUB00005997]]. Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transport proteins mediate the coupled movement of Na<sup>+</sup>and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>across plasma membranes, often in an electrogenic manner [[cite:PUB00018713]]. Na<sup>+</sup>driven Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>exchange and K<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>exchange activities have also been detected in certain cell types, although the molecular identities of the proteins responsible remain to be determined.</p>\n\n<p>Sequence analysis of the two families of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>transporters that have been cloned to date (the anion exchangers and Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporters) reveals that they are homologous. This is not entirely unexpected, given that they both transport HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>and are inhibited by a class of pharmacological agents called disulphonic stilbenes [[cite:PUB00006023]]. They share around ~25-30% sequence identity, which is distributed along their entire sequence length, and have similar predicted membrane topologies, suggesting they have ~10 transmembrane (TM) domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transport proteins are involved in cellular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>absorption and secretion, and also with intracellular pH regulation. They mediate the coupled movement of Na<sup>+</sup>and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>across plasma membranes in most of the cell types so far investigated. A single HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>is transported together with one to three Na<sup>+</sup>; this transport mode is therefore often electrogenic. In the kidney, an electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporter is the principal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter of the renal proximal tubule, and is responsible for reabsorption of more than 85% of the filtered load of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>[[cite:PUB00018713]]. Until recently, the molecular nature of these Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporters had remained undiscovered, as initial attempts to clone them based on presumed homology to Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(anion) exchangers had proved unsuccessful. Instead, an expression cloning strategy was successfully utilised to identify the Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporter from salamander kidney, an organ previously found to possess electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transport activity [[cite:PUB00006024]]. At least 3 mammalian Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporters have since been cloned, with similar primary sequence lengths and putative membrance topologies. One of these has been found to be a kidney-specific isoform [[cite:PUB00006023]], which is near-identical (except for a varying N-terminal region) to a more widely-distributed co-transporter cloned from pancreatic tissue [[cite:PUB00006025]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016152", "name" "Phosphotransferase/anion transporter", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01232" "NAHCO3TRSPRT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sodium bicarbonate cotransporter", "short" "Na/HCO3_transpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 916, "taxa" 4810, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 78044, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12183, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7237}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003024", :literature {"PUB00006024" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6631", "authors" ["Romero MF" "Hediger MA" "Boulpaep EL" "Boron WF."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/387409a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Expression cloning and characterization of a renal electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "409-13", "volume" "387", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9163427}, "PUB00006023" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Burnham CE" "Amlal H" "Wang Z" "Shull GE" "Soleimani M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
