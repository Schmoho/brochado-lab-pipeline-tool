{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes N6-succino-2-amino-2'-deoxyadenylate synthase PurZ from phages. It is involved in the synthesis of the atypical nucleotide dZTP (2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate) and in the synthesis of N6-succino-2-amino-2'-deoxyadenylate, which undergoes defumarylation and phosphorylation respectively by host PurB and guanylate/nucleoside diphosphate kinases to give dZTP (2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate). dZTP is integrated into the viral genome instead of adenine by the viral polymerase. This Z-base probably completely replaces adenosine and forms a triple bond to the opposite T-base. The resulting non-standard viral DNA is called Z-genome. The chemically modified DNA is probably harder for the host bacteria to digest with nucleases or restriction enzymes [[cite:PUB00100538], [cite:PUB00097959]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7vf6", "name" "The crystal structure of PurZ0"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04166" "N6-succino-2-amino-2'-deoxyadenylate synthase [purZ]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N6-succino-2-amino-2'-deoxyadenylate synthase", "short" "Phage_PurZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 135, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
