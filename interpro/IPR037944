{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PRX5-like proteins belongs to the peroxiredoxin (PRX) family [[cite:PUB00080828]]. PRX5 is a homodimeric thioredoxin (TRX) peroxidase widely expressed in tissues and found cellularly in mitochondria, peroxisomes and the cytosol [[cite:PUB00087917]]. The cellular location of PRX5 suggests that it may have an important antioxidant role in organelles that are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as a role in the control of signal transduction [[cite:PUB00087918]]. Budding yeast PRX5 homologue, Ahp1, may act as both a peroxidase and a receptor for alkylhydroperoxides [[cite:PUB00088100]]. Pmp20 from fission yeast may act as a chaperone rather than a peroxidase [[cite:PUB00088101]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all other PRXs, the N-terminal peroxidatic cysteine of PRX5 is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate upon reaction with peroxides. Human PRX5 is able to resolve this intermediate by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond with its C-terminal cysteine (the resolving cysteine), which can then be reduced by TRX, just like an atypical 2-cys PRX. This resolving cysteine, however, is not conserved in other members of the subfamily. In such cases, it is assumed that the oxidized cysteine is directly resolved by an external small-molecule or protein reductant, typical of a 1-cys PRX. PRX5 homodimers show an A-type interface, similar to atypical 2-cys PRXs [[cite:PUB00037308], [cite:PUB00010128]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1hd2", "name" "Human peroxiredoxin 5"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03013" "PRX5_like"}, "panther" {"PTHR10430" "PEROXIREDOXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peroxiredoxin-5-like", "short" "PRX5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 36, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4811, "taxa" 17517, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19848, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19842, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14193}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
