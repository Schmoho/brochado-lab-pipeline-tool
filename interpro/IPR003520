{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell exterior. There have been four secretion systems described in sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [[cite:PUB00007897]].</p>\n\n<p>The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell [[cite:PUB00007898]] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of bacterial flagellar biosynthesis. However, while the latter forms a ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of the flagellum itself [[cite:PUB00007583]], type III subunits in the outer membrane translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure.</p>\n\n<p>The Salmonella/Shigella invasion protein E gene (InvE) is one such type III secretion protein subunit, and is localised to the outer membrane of the SPI I pathogenicity island, and is involved in the surface presentation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01344" "INVEPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Salmonella/Shigella invasion protein E", "short" "Invas_InvE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 56, "taxa" 684, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4196, "sets" 0, "proteins" 776, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 654}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003520", :literature {"PUB00007897" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Mecsas JJ" "Strauss EJ."], "ISO_journal" "Emerging Infect.
