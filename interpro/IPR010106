{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes recombination-promoting nuclease RpnA (also known as YhgA) from<i>Escherichia coli</i>, which is a low activity DNA endonuclease active on single- and double-stranded DNA, but not RNA, with little sequence specificity  [[cite:PUB00085189]].  This aids horizontal gene transfer because the cleavage products are capable of providing priming sites for DNA polymerase, which can enable DNA joining by primer-template switching.  Thus, many members of this family possess the YhgA-like domain ([interpro:IPR006842]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members are found in small numbers of genomes, but in large copy numbers in many of those species, including over 30 full length and fragmentary members in the oral pathogenic spirochete Treponema denticola. The strongest similarities are usually within rather than between species. In T. denticola, full-length members are often found near transporters or other membrane proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01784" "Rpn family recombination-promoting nuclease/putative transposase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Recombination-promoting nuclease RpnA", "short" "RpnA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1096, "taxa" 6501, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23248, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23230, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17634}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
