{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family is the ATP-binding cassette subunit of binding protein-dependent ABC transporter complex that strictly co-occurs with [ncbifam:TIGR03769]. TIGRFAMs model [ncbifam:TIGR03769] describes a protein domain that occurs singly or as one of up to three repeats in proteins of a number of Actinobacteria, including Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202. The [ncbifam:TIGR03769] domain occurs both in an adjacent gene for the substrate-binding protein and in additional (often nearby) proteins, often with LPXTG-like sortase recognition signals. Homologous ATP-binding subunits outside the scope of this family include manganese transporter MntA in Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 and chelated iron transporter subunits. The function of this transporter complex is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03771" "anchored repeat-type ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, anchored repeat-type, ATP-binding subunit", "short" "ABC_trspt_anch-rpt_ATP-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 184, "taxa" 605, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 454, "sets" 0, "proteins" 454, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 355}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0857", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0857"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022508", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022508", "name" "ABC transporter, anchored repeat-type, ATP-binding subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
