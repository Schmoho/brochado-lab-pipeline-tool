{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha- and gamma-adaptin-binding protein p34 is a protein involved in membrane trafficking. It is known to interact with both alpha and gamma adaptin [[cite:PUB00044137]]. It has been speculated that p34 may play a chaperone role such as preventing the soluble adaptors from co-assembling with soluble clathrin, or helping to remove the adaptors from the coated vesicle. It may also aid in the recruitment of soluble adaptors onto the membrane [[cite:PUB00044137]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14659" "ALPHA- AND GAMMA-ADAPTIN-BINDING PROTEIN P34"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha/gamma-adaptin-binding protein p34", "short" "Alpha/Gamma-adaptin-bd_p34"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1555, "taxa" 6000, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2780, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2780, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1845}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019341", :literature {"PUB00044137" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Page LJ" "Sowerby PJ" "Lui WW" "Robinson MS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
