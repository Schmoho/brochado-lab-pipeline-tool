{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SSTK-IP, SSTK-interacting protein or TSSK6-activating co-chaperone, is a family of proteins found in eukaryotes. SSTK-IP directly binds to HSP70, is found associated with HSP70 and HSP90 in cells, and facilitates HSP90-dependent enzymatic activation of SSTK. SSTK is a small serine/threonine kinase expressed post-meiotically and essential for male fertility along with two other serine threonine kinases. SSTK is one of the smallest protein kinases, consisting only of N- and C-lobes of a kinase catalytic domain, and forms stable associations with heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90. SSTK-IP, its interacting protein, represents a germ cell-specific co-chaperone critical to the HSP90-mediated activation of SSTK [[cite:PUB00075987]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37368" "TSSK6-ACTIVATING CO-CHAPERONE PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF15836" "SSTK-interacting protein, TSSK6-activating co-chaperone protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TSSK6-activating co-chaperone protein", "short" "SSTK-IP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 132, "taxa" 489, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 268, "sets" 0, "proteins" 267, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 171}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031679", :literature {"PUB00075987" {"URL" nil, "issue" "45", "authors" ["Jha KN" "Wong L" "Zerfas PM" "De Silva RS" "Fan YX" "Spiridonov NA" "Johnson GR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
