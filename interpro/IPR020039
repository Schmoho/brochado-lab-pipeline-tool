{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents PseF, a Acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase domain-containing protein which is homologous to the NeuA protein responsible for the transfer of CMP to neuraminic acid. PseF is responsible for the transfer of CMP to the structurally related sugar, pseudaminic acid, which is observed as a component of sugar modifications of flagellin in Campylobacter species [[cite:PUB00045365]]. It is commonly encoded in flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis loci, generally located in apparent operons with other genes responsible for the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9ftc", "name" "Aeromonas caviae CMP-Pse5Ac7Ac synthetase in the presence of CMP-Pse5Ac7Ac."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03584" "pseudaminic acid cytidylyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pseudaminic acid cytidylyltransferase", "short" "PseF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 516, "taxa" 3287, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2505, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2505, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1997}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0796", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0796"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
