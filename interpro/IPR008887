{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This small family of proteins is currently restricted to Methanosarcina species.  Members of this family are about 200 residues in length, except for [swissprot:Q8TMK1] that has two copies of this region.  Although the function of this region is unknown the pattern of conservation suggests that this may be an enzyme, including multiple conserved aspartate and glutamate residues. The most conserved motif in these proteins is NEL/MEXNE/D, where X can be any amino acid, and is found at the C terminus of these proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05727" "Uncharacterised protein family (UPF0228)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0228", "short" "UPF0228"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 84, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 281, "sets" 0, "proteins" 263, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 261}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008887", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008887", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0228", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 13}}}
