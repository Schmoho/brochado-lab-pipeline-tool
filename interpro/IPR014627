{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group contain a modified version of the HD-GYP domain and an uncharacterised N-terminal domain. There is currently no experimental data for members of this group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HD-GYP is a conserved domain found in response regulator modules of various signal transduction systems. The involvement of the HD-GYP domain in signal transduction was originally proposed on the basis of its association with CheY-like and other signal transduction domains [[cite:PUB00011196]] and was later directly demonstrated experimentally by showing that RpfG is involved in regulation of the biosynthesis of extracellular endoglucanase and polysaccharide [[cite:PUB00011195]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A modification of the HD-GYP domain, which is found in this group, [interpro:IPR014408], and several smaller groups, lacks the conserved distal portion of the domain and has certain substitutions in the characteristic metal-binding residues [[cite:PUB00005837]] of the HD superfamily phosphohydrolases, which likely render it catalytically inactive. Note that the prototypical HD domain ([interpro:IPR006674]) is not recognised in many members of this group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exact mode of action and targets of the HD-GYP output domain are not known [[cite:PUB00007150]]. HD-GYP proteins are associated to the HD domain superfamily of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases; HD designates the principal conserved residues implicated in metal binding and catalysis [[cite:PUB00005837]]. The HD-GYP version of the HD-type domain has many additional highly conserved residues, including a conserved GYP motif, hence its name [[cite:PUB00011196], [cite:PUB00007150]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been noted that the highly conserved sequence of the HD-GYP domain suggests high substrate specificity [[cite:PUB00007150]]. On the basis of its association with the GGDEF diguanylate cyclase domain, it has been also predicted that the HD-GYP domain may be involved in the metabolism of cyclic diguanylate or in dephosphorylation of some phosphotransfer domain [[cite:PUB00007150]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036888" "Predicted signal transduction protein with modified HD-GYP domain, PA5346 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP036888, signal transduction HD-GYP-like, PA5346 type", "short" "UCP036888_HDGYP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 190, "taxa" 1212, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1459, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1170}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014627", :literature {"PUB00011196" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Galperin MY" "Natale DA" "Aravind L" "Koonin EV."], "ISO_journal" "J.
