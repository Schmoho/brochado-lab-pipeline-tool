{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of SNF2 domain-containing proteins from plants, including CLSY1-3 and DRD1 from Arabidopsis. CLSY and DRD1 contain a SNF2-like domain and a helicase domain near the C terminus. They are required for siRNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00096470], [cite:PUB00096472]]. Polymerases IVa/Pol IV and Pol IVb/Pol V are plant-specific RNA polymerases involved in in multiple small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways. CLSY1 is required for proper localization of both NRPD1 (the largest subunit of Pol IV) and RDR2 [[cite:PUB00096470]]. DRD1 has been shown to mediate RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V) recruitment to chromatin [[cite:PUB00091099], [cite:PUB00096469]]. Interestingly, DRD1 and Pol V appear to be required not only for RNA-directed de novo methylation, but also for full erasure of methylation when the RNA trigger is withdrawn [[cite:PUB00096473]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45821" "SNF2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN CLASSY 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SNF2 domain-containing protein CLSY/DRD1", "short" "CLSY/DRD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 251, "taxa" 989, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2825, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2825, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1415}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
