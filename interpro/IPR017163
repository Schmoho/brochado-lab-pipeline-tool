{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant-type phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K; [ec:2.7.1.68]), which play an essential role in coordinating plant growth, especially in response to environmental factors. This enzyme phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate as a precursor of two second messengers, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, and as a regulator of many cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organisation. This enzyme is involved in flowering, and may suppress floral initiation by modifying the expression of genes related to floral induction. It appears to be stress-induced [[cite:PUB00044688], [cite:PUB00044689]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037274" "Predicted phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, plant", "short" "PIno-4-P-5_kinase_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 246, "taxa" 945, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4513, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3379, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1982}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
