The open reading frame UL84 of human cytomegalovirus encodes a multifunctional regulatory protein which is required for viral DNA replication and binds with high affinity to the immediate-early transactivator IE2-p86 [[cite:PUB00012307]]. This protein interacts with DNA sequences in oriLyt containing several CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPÎ±) transcription factor binding sites, which is essential for its amplification [[cite:PUB00100070]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06284" "Cytomegalovirus UL84 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL84", "short" "Herpes_UL84"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 47, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010436", :literature {"PUB00012307" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lischka P" "Sorg G" "Kann M" "Winkler M" "Stamminger T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
