{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The PrsA protein of Bacillus subtilis is an essential membrane-bound lipoprotein that is assumed to assist post-translocational folding of exported proteins and stabilise them in the compartment between the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. This folding activity is consistent with the homology of a segment of PrsA with parvulin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIase). PrsA is a PPIase, but the essential role in vivo seems to depend on some non-PPIase activity of both the parvulin-like and flanking domains [[cite:PUB00053986]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vj4", "name" "1.70 Angstrom Resolution Crystal Structure of Peptidylprolyl Isomerase (PrsA) from Bacillus anthracis"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01145" "Foldase protein PrsA [prsA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Foldase protein PrsA", "short" "Foldase_PrsA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 753, "taxa" 2908, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3877, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3877, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2825}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
