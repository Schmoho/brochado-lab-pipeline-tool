{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This ribosomally synthesized peptide is usually in the gene neighbourhood of a RimK-like ATP-grasp, and an ABC ATPase fused to a papain-like domain. It is often present in multiple tandem gene copies. The gene contexts suggest that it is modified by the  ATP-grasp as in the biosynthesis of microviridin and marinostatin.  They might function in defence or development or as peptide antibiotics [[cite:PUB00057486]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14406" "Ribosomally synthesized peptide in Bacteroidetes"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomally synthesized peptide in Bacteroidetes", "short" "Bacteroid_pep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 94, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 94, "sets" 0, "proteins" 94, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 91}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025842", :literature {"PUB00057486" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Abhiman S" "Maxwell Burroughs A" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b917682a", "medline_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "title" "Amidoligases with ATP-grasp, glutamine synthetase-like and acetyltransferase-like domains: synthesis of novel metabolites and peptide modifications of proteins.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1636-60", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20023723}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025842", "name" "Ribosomally synthesized peptide in Bacteroidetes", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 14}}}
