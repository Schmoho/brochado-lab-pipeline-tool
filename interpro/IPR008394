{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several AfaD and related proteins from Escherichia coli and Salmonella bacteria. The afa gene clusters encode an afimbrial adhesive sheath produced by E. coli. The adhesive sheath is composed of two proteins, AfaD and AfaE, which are independently exposed at the bacterial cell surface.  AfaE is required for bacterial adhesion to HeLa cells and AfaD for the uptake of adherent bacteria into these cells [[cite:PUB00011246]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2axw", "name" "Structure of DraD invasin from uropathogenic Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008966", "name" "Adhesion domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037028", "name" "Dr-adhesin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05775" "Enterobacteria AfaD invasin protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Enterobacteria AfaD invasin", "short" "AfaD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 298, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 660, "sets" 0, "proteins" 660, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 589}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008394", :literature {"PUB00011246" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Garcia MI" "Jouve M" "Nataro JP" "Gounon P" "Le Bouguenec C."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01898-6", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Characterization of the AfaD-like family of invasins encoded by pathogenic Escherichia coli associated with intestinal and extra-intestinal infections.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "111-7", "volume" "479", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10981717}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008394", "name" "Enterobacteria AfaD invasin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 9}}}
