{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial HrpE proteins, which are believed to function on the type III secretion system, specifically the secretion of  HrpZ (harpinPss) [[cite:PUB00044769]]. This family also includes V-type proton ATPase subunit E proteins. This subunit appears to form a tight interaction with subunit G in the F0 complex. Subunits E and G may act together as stators to prevent certain subunits from rotating with the central rotary element [[cite:PUB00020636]].
