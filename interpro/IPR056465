{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent the type 4 apparatus protein DotY from Legionella pneumophila and related proteins from gammaproteobacteria. DotY is a component of Type 4B secretion (T4BS) system that translocates over 300 effectors into the host cell during infection. This protein is part of a subcomplex which recruits effector proteins and delivers them to the core transmembrane subcomplex [[cite:PUB00100787]]. In the membrane-embedded T4 coupling complex (T4CC), DotY makes extensive contacts with DotZ. The DotLMNYZ components form a hetero-pentameric core of the T4CC complex from which the flexible IcmSW module protrudes [[cite:PUB00100787]]. These hetero-pentameric complexes assemble and form an inner membrane channel for effectors to pass through. DotY and DotZ play a role in effector translocation and optimise secretion by modulating the delivery trajectory of the IcmSW module [[cite:PUB00153336]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23131" "DotY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DotY", "short" "DotY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 87, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 88, "sets" 0, "proteins" 88, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 78}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056465", :literature {"PUB00100787" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Meir A" "Mace K" "Lukoyanova N" "Chetrit D" "Hospenthal MK" "Redzej A" "Roy C" "Waksman G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Mechanism of effector capture and delivery by the type IV secretion system from Legionella pneumophila.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "2864", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32513920}, "PUB00153336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Mace K" "Meir A" "Lukoyanova N" "Liu L" "Chetrit D" "Hospenthal MK" "Roy CR" "Waksman G."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14847", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Proteins DotY and DotZ modulate the dynamics and localization of the type IVB coupling complex of Legionella pneumophila.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "307-319", "volume" "117", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34816517}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056465", "name" "DotY", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 30}}}
