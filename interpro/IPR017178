{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, which converts 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (ME-2,4CPP) into 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the sixth step of nonmevalonate terpenoid biosynthesis. It is essential in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is described as \"atypical\" because it contains a partially-duplicated domain.  The family is found in bacteria, where it is widely but not universally distributed, and chloroplasts, where it is essential for chloroplast development [[cite:PUB00085129]], salicylic acid-mediated disease resistance to pathogens [[cite:PUB00085130]] and requires ferrdoxin as a co-factor [[cite:PUB00085131]].
