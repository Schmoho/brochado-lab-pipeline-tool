{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haem-containing catalase-peroxidases are bifunctional antioxidant enzymes that exhibit both catalase ([ec:1.11.1.6]) and peroxidase ([ec:1.11.1.7]) activity, and which are present predominantly in bacterial species [[cite:PUB00053578]]. Several evolutionary lineages are present also in archaeal, fungal, and protistan species. These enzymes provide protection against oxidative stress by dismutating hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water [[cite:PUB00053579]]. Phylogenetically they are closely related to ascorbate peroxidases and cytochrome c peroxidases [[cite:PUB00000617]] and can be divided in two distinct clades [[cite:PUB00053580]]. They do not share sequence similarity with mono-functional, haem-containing catalases ([interpro:IPR002226]) that are ubiquitous in aerobic organisms, nor with non-haem manganese-containing catalases found in bacteria ([interpro:IPR007760]). Catalases perform a unique two-step reaction cycle that cleaves two hydrogen peroxide molecules heterolytically to alternately oxidise and reduce the haem iron thus releasing water and molecular oxygen [[cite:PUB00053579]]. Contrary, peroxidases use hydrogen peroxide only to oxidise the haem iron, but use different electron donors such as NADH or ascorbate to then reduce the haem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure of the catalase-peroxidase from the archaeon, Haloarcula marismortui (Halobacterium marismortui), reveals a dimer of two identical subunits [[cite:PUB00015058]], although some catalase-peroxidases can exist also as homotetramers. The general topology, as well as the arrangement of the catalytic residues and haem in the active site, are similar to other class I peroxidases. However, the location of the haem group deeply buried inside the domain is typical of a catalase. The primary structure of the subunit can be divided into two similar halves, which very probably arose from a gene duplication event [[cite:PUB00000617], [cite:PUB00053582]]. A similar structure was obtained also for a catalase-peroxidase from the proteobacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei [[cite:PUB00027476]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1itk", "name" "Crystal structure of catalase-peroxidase from Haloarcula marismortui"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010255", "name" "Haem peroxidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00460" "Bacterial haem catalase-peroxidase"}, "panther" {"PTHR30555" "HYDROPEROXIDASE I, BIFUNCTIONAL CATALASE-PEROXIDASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01961" "Catalase-peroxidase [katG]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00198" "catalase/peroxidase HPI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Catalase-peroxidase haem", "short" "Catalase_peroxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 96, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5253, "taxa" 19468, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23689, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23622, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17781}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1598", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1598"} {"accession" "GenProp0213", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0213"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
