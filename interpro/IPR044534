{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of tetratricopeptide thioredoxin-like proteins (TTLs), including TTL1-4 from Arabidopsis. They are characterised by the presence of six tetratricopeptide repeats in conserved positions and a C-terminal region known as the thioredoxin-like domain with homology to thioredoxins. TTL2 is specific to pollen grains, while TTL1/3/4 display ubiquitous expression in normal growing conditions but differential expression patterns in response to osmotic and NaCl stresses. TTL1, TTL3, and TTL4 have partially overlapping yet specific functions in abiotic stress tolerance while TTL2 is involved in male gametophytic transmission [[cite:PUB00096369]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011990", "name" "Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46050" "TPR REPEAT-CONTAINING THIOREDOXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TPR repeat-containing thioredoxin TTL1-4", "short" "TTL1-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 265, "taxa" 1156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2769, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2769, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1701}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044534", :literature {"PUB00096369" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lakhssassi N" "Doblas VG" "Rosado A" "del Valle AE" "Pose D" "Jimenez AJ" "Castillo AG" "Valpuesta V" "Borsani O" "Botella MA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "The Arabidopsis tetratricopeptide thioredoxin-like gene family is required for osmotic stress tolerance and male sporogenesis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1252-66", "volume" "158", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22232384}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044534", "name" "TPR repeat-containing thioredoxin TTL1-4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
