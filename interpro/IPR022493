{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins that are commonly preceded by a structured RNA element called the yybP-ykoY leader, or SraF, which may precede one or several genes in a genome. Members of this highly hydrophobic protein family often are preceded by a yybP-ykoY leader, which may serve as a riboswitch. From the larger group of TerC homologues, this subfamily contains proteins YceF and YkoY from Bacillus subtilis.
