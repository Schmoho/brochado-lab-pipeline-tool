{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The protozoan parasite that causes Chagas' disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, contains a 24kDa protein that is recognised by antisera from both humans and experimental animals infected with this organism. Near its C terminus are two regions that have sequence similarity with E-F hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins [[cite:PUB00008082]]. Indeed, the native trypanosome protein exhibits low Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding capacity and high Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity, consistent with binding via E-F hand structures. Immunofluorescence assays have suggested that the protein is localised to the trypanosome's flagellum. This observation, coupled with the protein's Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties, suggests that it may participate in molecular processes associated with the high motility of the parasite [[cite:PUB00008082]].<p>A set of similar 24kDa proteins, termed calflagins, are contained within the flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei. These contain three EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>- binding domains and one degenerate EF-hand motif [[cite:PUB00008083]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3cs1", "name" "Flagellar Calcium-binding Protein (FCaBP) from T. cruzi"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011992", "name" "EF-hand domain pair", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01362" "Flagellar calcium-binding protein (calflagin)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar calcium-binding protein calflagin", "short" "Calflagin-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 139, "taxa" 875, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1880, "sets" 0, "proteins" 441, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 349}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003299", :literature {"PUB00008082" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Engman DM" "Krause KH" "Blumin JH" "Kim KS" "Kirchhoff LV" "Donelson JE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
