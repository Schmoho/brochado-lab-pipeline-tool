{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) and undecaprenol kinase (UDPK) constitute a family of multispan membrane enzymes that are very small, lack relationships to any other family of proteins and exhibit an unusual structure. Escherichia coli DAGK plays an important role in recycling diacylglycerol produced as a by-product of biosynthesis of molecules located in the periplasmic space. UDPK seems to play an analogous role in Gram-positive bacteria, where it is essential for biofilm formation by the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans [[cite:PUB00080161]]. In Bacillus subtilis, UDPK is an essential kinase in the diacylglycerol cycle involved in lipoteichoic acid production and seems to be indispensable for the maintenance of spore stability and viability [[cite:PUB00053893]].</p>\n\n<p>Diacylglycerol kinase ([ec:2.7.1.107]) (DAGK) is an enzyme that catalyses the formation of phosphatidic acid from diacylglycerol and ATP, an important step in phospholipid biosynthesis. In bacteria DAGK is a very small (13 to 15 kD) membrane protein which seems to contain three transmembrane domains [[cite:PUB00002252]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036945", "name" "Diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34299" "DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE"}, "prosite" {"PS01069" "Prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase signature"}, "pfam" {"PF01219" "Prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DAGK family", "short" "DAGK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 27, "proteomes" 4679, "taxa" 21143, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23032, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23032, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17869}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00820", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00820"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
