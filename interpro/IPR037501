{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytokinesis in plants, in contrast to animals and yeasts, starts with targeted secretion and fusion of vesicles between the separated chromosomes at the centre of the cell. TPLATE is a plant-specific protein with similarity to the Adaptin/Coatomer proteins that is recruited during plant somatic cytokinesis [[cite:PUB00087072]]. TPLATE is part of a unique multisubunit protein complex (the TPLATE complex, TPC) that acts in concert with the AP2 complex, dynamin-related proteins and clathrin, and that it is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plants [[cite:PUB00087071]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides TPLATE, this entry also includes TSET complex member tstA from Dictyostelium discoideum (Slime mold).
