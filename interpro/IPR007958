{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Short scorpion toxin chloride channel inhibitors are short-chain neurotoxins (SCNs), which block small-conductance chloride channels. They are 30-40-residue long and contain four intramolecular disulphide bridges, which have been assigned as C1-C4, C2-C6, C3-C7 and C5-C8 [[cite:PUB00000410], [cite:PUB00033808], [cite:PUB00033809]].</p>\n\n<p>The global fold of the scorpion short toxin chloride channel inhibitor subfamily is an α-helix packed on a two-stranded β-sheet. The structure also contains a short fragment in an extended form. The two antiparalllel β-strands are connected by a type I β-turn. The four disulphide bridges help to maintain a very compact structure by heavily attaching the N-terminal and C-terminal ends to the α-helix [[cite:PUB00000410], [cite:PUB00033808], [cite:PUB00033809]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6atw", "name" "Exploring Cystine Dense Peptide Space to Open a Unique Molecular Toolbox"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51200" "Scorpion short toxin chloride channel inhibitor subfamily profile"}, "pfam" {"PF05294" "Scorpion short toxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Scorpion short chain toxin, chloride channel inhibitor", "short" "Scorpion_toxinS_Cl_inh"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 176, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 77, "sets" 0, "proteins" 77, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 60}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC51200", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC51200"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007958", :literature {"PUB00000410" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lippens G" "Najib J" "Wodak SJ" "Tartar A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00001a003", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "NMR sequential assignments and solution structure of chlorotoxin, a small scorpion toxin that blocks chloride channels.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "13-21", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7819188}, "PUB00033808" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Adjadj E" "Naudat V" "Quiniou E" "Wouters D" "Sautiere P" "Craescu CT."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
