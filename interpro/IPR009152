{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Quinol-cytochrome c reductases (also called the cytochrome bc1 complex) constitute a large family of enzymes which transfer electrons from quinols to cytochrome c, translocating protons across membranes in the process. They function in bacterial and mitochondrial repiratory chains, and also the photosythetic electron transfer chains of bacteria and plastids. These enzymes share a common functional core consisting of cytochrome b, a Reiske Fe-S protein, and cytochrome c.</p>\n\n<p>Actinobacteria such as Mycobacteria or Corynebacteria possess a branched aerobic respiratory chain in which electrons flow from NADH dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase complexes into the menaquinone-menaquinol pool, from where they are transferred either to an aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase via the cytochrome bc1 complex, or to the cytochrome bd-type menaquinol oxidase; the latter important for microaerobic respiration [[cite:PUB00081475]]. In these bacteria the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase and the cytochrome bc1 complex form a supercomplex [[cite:PUB00035558]]. This entry represents the cytochrome c subunit QcrC of the bc1 complex [[cite:PUB00035558], [cite:PUB00035559]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000007" "Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase, cytochrome c subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome bc1 complex, cytochrome c subunit", "short" "bc1_cytC-su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1751, "taxa" 4835, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4735, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3692}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
