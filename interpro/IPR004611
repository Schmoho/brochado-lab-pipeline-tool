{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The DNA primase DnaG of Escherichia coli and its apparent orthologs in other bacterial species are approximately 600 residues in length. Within this set, a conspicuous outlier in percent identity, as seen in a UPGMA difference tree, is the branch containing the Mycoplasmas. This lineage is also unique in containing the small, DNA primase-related protein found in this family, which is homologous to the central third of DNA primase. Several small regions of sequence similarity specifically to Mycoplasma sequences rather than to all DnaG homologues suggests that the divergence of this protein from DnaG post-dated the separation of bacterial lineages. The function of this DNA primase-related protein is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00646" "DNA primase-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA primase-related protein", "short" "DNA_primase-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 14, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004611", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004611", "name" "DNA primase-related protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
