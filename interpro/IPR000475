{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The virion infectivity factor (vif) is an accessory protein, which is essential for HIV replication in host cells. Vif of Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) affects the infectivity of virus particles [[cite:PUB00005104]] to T lymphocytes and macrophages (in some cases increasing the infectivity of HIV-1 particles by 100- to 1000-fold), but has no direct effect on transcription, translation or virus release. Vif antibodies are found in the sera of patients at all levels of HIV-1 infection, indicating that vif is expressed in natural infections<i>in vivo</i>. Other lentiviruses, including Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV-cpz), Visna/Maedi virus, and Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), have vif open reading frames, suggesting vif plays an essential role during natural infections [[cite:PUB00003498]]. The expression of vif in BHK-21 cells has been shown to be linked to a modification of the C terminus of gp41env, which modification is inhibited by trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidio)butane (E64), a specific inhibitor of cysteine proteases [[cite:PUB00003492]]. Coupled with sequence analysis and the effects of point mutations in vif, it has been suggested that vif could be a cysteine protease. Virions produced in the absence of Vif have abnormal core morphology and those produced in primary T cells carry immature core proteins and low levels of mature capsid [[cite:PUB00014092]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, HIV-1 Vif hijacks cellular E3 ligase components containing CUL5, RBX2, ELOB, ELOC and CBFbeta, to poly-ubiquitinate antiviral cellular factors, APOBEC3 proteins [[cite:PUB00093483], [cite:PUB00093484], [cite:PUB00093485]]. In sheep and goats, Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) Vif is responsible for degradation of oaA3Z2-Z3 [[cite:PUB00093486]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00559" "Retroviral Vif (Viral infectivity) protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_04081" "Virion infectivity factor [vif]"}, "prints" {"PR00349" "VIRIONINFFCT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Retroviral Vif (Viral infectivity) protein", "short" "Vif"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 34, "taxa" 147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21288, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21265, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000475", :literature {"PUB00014092" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Pomerantz RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
