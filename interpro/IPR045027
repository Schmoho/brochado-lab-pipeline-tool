{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Homer (also known as Vesl) family members, including Homer1/2/3, are synaptic scaffolding proteins that regulate localisation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are known to play major roles in neural signal transduction. Homer family members contain the EVH1 domain at the N terminus for receptor binding, two leucine zipper motifs at the C terminus for clustering, and a linking region whose function is unclear. Besides binding to mGluR, Homer family members also recognise the PPXXF motif found in other binding partners [[cite:PUB00028647]]. Homer2 and Homer3, but not Homer1, have been shown to bind to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and serve as negative regulators of NFAT-dependent signaling in T cells [[cite:PUB00048638]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ddw", "name" "HOMER EVH1 DOMAIN UNLIGANDED"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10918" "HOMER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homer family", "short" "Homer"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 923, "taxa" 3726, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3135}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045027", :literature {"PUB00028647" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Irie K" "Nakatsu T" "Mitsuoka K" "Miyazawa A" "Sobue K" "Hiroaki Y" "Doi T" "Fujiyoshi Y" "Kato H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
