{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Calcitonin [[cite:PUB00000472]] is a 32 amino acid polypeptide hormone that causes a rapid but short-lived drop in the level of calcium and phosphate in the blood, by promoting the incorporation of these ions in the bones. This is the alpha type. Alternative splicing of the gene coding for calcitonin produces a distantly related peptide of 37 amino acids, called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), beta type. CGRP induces vasodilatation in a variety of vessels, including the coronary, cerebral and systemic vasculature. Its abundance in the CNS also points toward a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role.</p>\n\n<p>Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) [[cite:PUB00002606]] (also known as diabetes-associated peptide (DAP), or amylin) is a peptide of 37 amino acids that selectively inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose utilisation and glycogen deposition in muscle, while not affecting adipocyte glucose metabolism. Structurally, IAPP is closely related to CGRP.</p>\n\n<p>Calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide 1 stimulates cAMP production via the calcitonin receptor.</p>\n\n<p>Two conserved cysteines in the N-terminal of these peptides are known to be involved in a disulphide bond.
