{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of potent toxins that function as ion-channel inhibitors. Omega-Grammotoxin SIA is a VSCC antagonist that inhibits neuronal N- and P-type VSCC responses [[cite:PUB00057515]]. Huwentoxin-IV, from the Chinese bird spider, is a highly potent neurotoxin that specifically inhibits the neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons [[cite:PUB00028940]]. Hainantoxin-4, from the venom of spider Selenocosmia hainana, adopts an inhibitor cystine knot structural motif like huwentoin-IV, and is a potent antagonist that acts at site 1 on tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium channels [[cite:PUB00017227]]. Study of the molecular nature of toxin-receptor interactions has helped elucidate the functioning of many ion-channels [[cite:PUB00057516]]. Some members of this family, Tap1 and Tap2, can modulate the activity of both voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels which are implicated in the etiology of chronic pain, being interesting for chronic pain treatment [[cite:PUB00096648], [cite:PUB00097926]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the endoparasitoid wasp peptide Teratocyte protein CftICK-IV, which has immununosuppressive and insecticidal activities [[cite:PUB00152807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5epm", "name" "Ceratotoxin variant in complex with specific antibody Fab fragment"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07740" "Ion channel inhibitory toxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Huwentoxin-1 family", "short" "Huwentoxin-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 62, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 472, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 677, "sets" 0, "proteins" 669, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 627}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011696", :literature {"PUB00028940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["Peng K" "Shu Q" "Liu Z" "Liang S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
