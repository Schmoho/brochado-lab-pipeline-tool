{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The highly conserved and essential protein Ssu72 has intrinsic phosphatase activity and plays an essential role in the transcription cycle. Ssu72 was originally identified in a yeast genetic screen as enhancer of a defect caused by a mutation in the transcription initiation factor TFIIB [[cite:PUB00021070]]. It binds to TFIIB and is also involved in mRNA elongation. Ssu72 is further involved in both poly(A) dependent and independent termination. It is a subunit of the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF), which is part of the machinery for mRNA 3'-end formation. Ssu72 is also essential for transcription termination of snRNAs [[cite:PUB00020375]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4h3k", "name" "Crystal structure of a ternary complex of human symplekin NTD, human Ssu72 and a RNA polymerase II CTD peptide phosphorylated at Ser-2, Ser-5 and Ser-7"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04722" "Ssu72-like protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR20383" "RNA POLYMERASE II SUBUNIT A C-TERMINAL DOMAIN PHOSPHATASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase II subunit A", "short" "RNA_pol_II_suA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 71, "proteomes" 2487, "taxa" 8486, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4450, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4360, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2895}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
