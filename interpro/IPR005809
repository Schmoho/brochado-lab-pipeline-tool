{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of different enzymes that share a similar catalytic mechanism which involves the phosphorylation by ATP (or GTP) of a specific histidine residue in the active site. These enzymes are:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Succinate--CoA ligase (GDP-forming  ([ec:6.2.1.4]) [[cite:PUB00005004]] is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the substrate level phosphorylation step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle: the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with a concomitant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and phosphate.  This enzyme is a dimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunits;</li>\n<li>Succinate--CoA ligase (ADP-forming) ([ec:6.2.1.5]) [[cite:PUB00000280]] is a bacterial enzyme that during aerobic metabolism functions in the citric acid cycle, coupling the hydrolysis of succinyl-CoA to the synthesis of ATP. It can also function in the other direction for anabolic purposes. This enzyme is a tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits;</li>\n<li>Malate--CoA ligase ([ec:6.2.1.9]) (malyl-CoA synthetase) [[cite:PUB00002257]], is a bacterial enzyme that forms malyl-CoA from malate and CoA with the concomitant hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate. Malate-CoA ligase is composed of two different subunits.</li>\n<li>ADP-forming sulfoacetate-CoA ligase, subunit SauC and SqwK, that catalyse the CoA- and ATP-dependent conversion of sulfoacetate to sulfoacetyl-CoA and ADP [[cite:PUB00153676], [cite:PUB00153675]].</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6xru", "name" "GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase complexed with desulfo-coenzyme A, magnesium ions and succinates"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001554" "Succinyl-CoA synthetase, beta subunit"}, "hamap" {"MF_00558" "Succinate--CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta [sucC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01016" "succinate-CoA ligase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Succinate--CoA ligase-like, beta subunit", "short" "Succ_CoA_ligase-like_bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10122, "taxa" 37672, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 42439, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42201, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31751}, "pathways" 75}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp1201", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1201"} {"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
