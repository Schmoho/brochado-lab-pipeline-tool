{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The taxilin family of proteins includes alpha-, beta- and gamma-taxilins.

Alpha-taxilin may also be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells [[cite:PUB00044512]], while gamma-taxilin (also known as Elrg) may have a role in cell cycle progression [[cite:PUB00060181]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09728" "Myosin-like coiled-coil protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR16127" "TAXILIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Taxilin family", "short" "Taxilin_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 84, "proteomes" 2207, "taxa" 7594, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6873, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6401, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4045}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026183", :literature {"PUB00060176" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Nogami S" "Satoh S" "Tanaka-Nakadate S" "Yoshida K" "Nakano M" "Terano A" "Shirataki H."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
