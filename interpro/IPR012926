{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of transmembrane proteins including TACAN (also known as TMEM120A) and TMEM120B. TMEM120A is involved in mechanosensation and plays an essential role in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation [[cite:PUB00094220], [cite:PUB00158954]]. It was first described as an ion channel that contributes to sensing mechanical pain [[cite:PUB00094219]], however, several studies show that TMEM120A does not exhibit mechanosensitive channel activity and display no typical ion channel structural characteristics [[cite:PUB00158955], [cite:PUB00158956], [cite:PUB00158957]]. TMEM120A is structurally similar to a lipid-modifying enzyme, ELOVL7, and contains a bound coenzyme A molecule, which suggests it might function as an enzyme in lipid metabolism [[cite:PUB00158955], [cite:PUB00158956], [cite:PUB00158957]]. Therefore, if TMEM120A is an enzyme rather than an ion channel is still in debate. TMEM120A and TMEM120B may be required for efficient adipogenesis [[cite:PUB00094220]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21433" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN INDUCED BY TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA"}, "pfam" {"PF07851" "TMPIT-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TMEM120A/B", "short" "TMEM120A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 67, "proteomes" 1336, "taxa" 5273, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5214, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4855, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3103}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012926", :literature {"PUB00094219" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Beaulieu-Laroche L" "Christin M" "Donoghue A" "Agosti F" "Yousefpour N" "Petitjean H" "Davidova A" "Stanton C" "Khan U" "Dietz C" "Faure E" "Fatima T" "MacPherson A" "Mouchbahani-Constance S" "Bisson DG" "Haglund L" "Ouellet JA" "Stone LS" "Samson J" "Smith MJ" "Ask K" "Ribeiro-da-Silva A" "Blunck R" "Poole K" "Bourinet E" "Sharif-Naeini R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "TACAN Is an Ion Channel Involved in Sensing Mechanical Pain.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "956-967.e17", "volume" "180", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32084332}, "PUB00094220" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Batrakou DG" "de Las Heras JI" "Czapiewski R" "Mouras R" "Schirmer EC."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "TMEM120A and B: Nuclear Envelope Transmembrane Proteins Important for Adipocyte Differentiation.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e0127712", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26024229}, "PUB00158954" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Liu X" "Zhang R" "Fatehi M" "Wang Y" "Long W" "Tian R" "Deng X" "Weng Z" "Xu Q" "Light PE" "Tang J" "Chen XZ."], "ISO_journal" "J Physiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1113/JP283895", "medline_journal" "J Physiol", "title" "Regulation of PKD2 channel function by TACAN.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "83-98", "volume" "601", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36420836}, "PUB00158956" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Rong Y" "Jiang J" "Gao Y" "Guo J" "Song D" "Liu W" "Zhang M" "Zhao Y" "Xiao B" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71474", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "TMEM120A contains a specific coenzyme A-binding site and might not mediate poking- or stretch-induced channel activities in cells.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e71474", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34409941}, "PUB00158955" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Xue J" "Han Y" "Baniasadi H" "Zeng W" "Pei J" "Grishin NV" "Wang J" "Tu BP" "Jiang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71220", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "TMEM120A is a coenzyme A-binding membrane protein with structural similarities to ELOVL fatty acid elongase.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e71220", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34374645}, "PUB00158957" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ke M" "Yu Y" "Zhao C" "Lai S" "Su Q" "Yuan W" "Yang L" "Deng D" "Wu K" "Zeng W" "Geng J" "Wu J" "Yan Z."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Discov", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-021-00319-5", "medline_journal" "Cell Discov", "title" "Cryo-EM structures of human TMEM120A and TMEM120B.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "77", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34465718}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012926", "name" "TMEM120A/B", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 35, "alignment:full" 3483}}}
