{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Asparagine tRNA ligase ([ec:6.1.1.22]) is an alpha2 dimer that belongs to class IIb.\r\nThere is a striking similarity between asparagine-tRNA ligases and archaeal/eukaryotic type aspartyl-tRNA ligases ([interpro:IPR004523]) and a striking divergence of bacterial type aspartyl-tRNA ligases ([interpro:IPR004524]). This family, AsnS, represents asparagine-tRNA ligases from the three domains of life. Some species lack this enzyme and charge tRNA(asn) by misacylation with Asp, followed by transamidation of Asp to Asn.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (also known as aminoacyl-tRNA ligases) catalyse the attachment of an amino acid to its cognate transfer RNA molecule in a highly specific two-step reaction [[cite:PUB00079872], [cite:PUB00079873]]. These proteins differ widely in size and oligomeric state, and have limited sequence homology [[cite:PUB00007191]]. The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II. Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contain a characteristic Rossman fold catalytic domain and are mostly monomeric [[cite:PUB00006477]]. Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases share an anti-parallel β-sheet fold flanked by α-helices [[cite:PUB00000386]], and are mostly dimeric or multimeric, containing at least three conserved regions [[cite:PUB00000723], [cite:PUB00005365], [cite:PUB00004391]]. However, tRNA binding involves an α-helical structure that is conserved between class I and class II synthetases. In reactions catalysed by the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the aminoacyl group is coupled to the 2'-hydroxyl of the tRNA, while, in class II reactions, the 3'-hydroxyl site is preferred. The synthetases specific for arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, and some lysine synthetases (non-eukaryotic group) belong to class I synthetases. The synthetases specific for alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, and some lysine synthetases (non-archaeal group), belong to class-II synthetases. Based on their mode of binding to the tRNA acceptor stem, both classes of tRNA synthetases have been subdivided into three subclasses, designated 1a, 1b, 1c and 2a, 2b, 2c [[cite:PUB00007363]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1x54", "name" "Crystal structure of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase from Pyrococcus horikoshii complexed with asparaginyl-adenylate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045864", "name" "Class II Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/Biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) and lipoyl protein ligase (LPL)", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00534" "Asparagine--tRNA ligase [asnS]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00457" "asparagine--tRNA ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Asparagine-tRNA ligase", "short" "Asn-tRNA-ligase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6706, "taxa" 26994, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28870, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28866, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20808}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0258", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0258"} {"accession" "GenProp0259", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0259"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
