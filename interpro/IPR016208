{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes aldehyde oxidases (AOXs) and xanthine dehydrogenases (XDHs). They are both molybdenum cofactor (Moco) containing enzymes [[cite:PUB00043467]]. AOX catalyses the reaction:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>aldehyde + H(2)O + O(2) = a carboxylic acid + H2O2</reaction></p>\n\n<p>It binds 2 2Fe-2S clusters uses FAD and molybdopterin as cofactors. XDH has the same cofactors and some of them can be converted from the dehydrogenase form (D) to the oxidase form (O). This can be done irreversibly by proteolysis or reversibly through the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups [[cite:PUB00100884]]. This enzyme catalyses three reactions:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>Xanthine  + H2O + NAD+= urate + NADH</reaction></p>\n\n<p><reaction>Hypoxanthine + H2O + NAD+= xanthine + NADH</reaction></p>\n\n<p><reaction>Xanthine + H2O + O2 = urate + H2O2</reaction></p>\n\n<p>In Arabidopsis thaliana, the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 is needed for post-translational activation of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase. It does this by transferring a sulfur atom to the desulfo-molybdenum cofactor of these enzymes [[cite:PUB00043468], [cite:PUB00043467]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4yrw", "name" "rat xanthine oxidoreductase, C-terminal deletion protein variant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037165", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, molybdopterin binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036856", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, a/b hammerhead superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45444" "XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE", "PTHR11908" "XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000127" "Xanthine dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase-like", "short" "Ald_Oxase/xanthine_DH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 85, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7170, "taxa" 29533, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 107576, "sets" 0, "proteins" 104865, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 72442}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
