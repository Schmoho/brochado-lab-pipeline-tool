{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes anti-sigma-F factor NrsF from<i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>, which is thought to be an anti-sigma factor for sigma F.<i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>survives where nutrients are low and where the concentration of heavy metals are high, and it is able to do so by altering the expression of a large number of genes.  Sigma factor F is involved in the control of the transcriptional response to chromium and cadmium, controlling at least eight genes, all of which are in the sigma F regulon.  NrsF is also in this regulon, and is released into the cytoplasm during chromium stress.  Substitution of two conserved cysteines abrogate the ability of NrsF to maintain the expression of sigma F-dependent genes at basal levels [[cite:PUB00086036]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06532" "Negative regulator of sigma F"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-sigma-F factor NrsF", "short" "NrsF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 799, "taxa" 3632, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4094, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4091, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3222}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009495", :literature {"PUB00086036" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kohler C" "Lourenco RF" "Avelar GM" "Gomes SL."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Microbiol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-12-210", "medline_journal" "BMC Microbiol", "title" "Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor ÏƒF is involved in Caulobacter crescentus response to heavy metal stress.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "210", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22985357}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009495", "name" "Anti-sigma-F factor NrsF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 90, "alignment:full" 953}}}
