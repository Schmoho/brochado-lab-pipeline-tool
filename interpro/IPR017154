{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes PC4-like proteins predominantly found in bacteria, such as SP_0782 from Streptococcus pneumoniae ([swissprot:A0A0H2UPA7]). The crystal structure of this protein has similarity with PC4 and YdbC ([interpro:IPR003173]), but it binds shorter ssDNA lengths. This protein adopts a dimeric assembly in which each monomer folds into an anti-parallel β-sheet made of four β-strands in the N-terminal and one α-helix in the C-terminal [[cite:PUB00100700]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5zkm", "name" "Crystal structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae SP_0782 (residues 7-79) in complex with single-stranded DNA TCTTCC"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037246" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP037246 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PC4-like", "short" "PC4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 583, "taxa" 2334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2150, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1725}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017154", :literature {"PUB00100700" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Li S" "Lu G" "Fang X" "Ramelot TA" "Kennedy MA" "Zhou X" "Gong P" "Zhang X" "Liu M" "Zhu J" "Yang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Structural insight into the length-dependent binding of ssDNA by SP_0782 from Streptococcus pneumoniae, reveals a divergence in the DNA-binding interface of PC4-like proteins.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "432-444", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31713614}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017154", "name" "PC4-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
