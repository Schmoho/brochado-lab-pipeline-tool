{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chemotaxis inhibitory protein (also knows as CHIPS) is a Staphylococcus aureus-secreted virulence factor that impairs the response of neutrophils and monocytes to FPR and C5a [[cite:PUB00054101]]. CHIPS has been shown to reduce neutrophil recruitment toward C5a in mouse models (its activity is more potent on human than on mouse cells). As such, its properties may make it a candidate new anti-inflammatory therapeutic compound [[cite:PUB00054101]].</p>\n\n<p>CHIPS also plays an key role in bacterial invasion, by inhibiting FMLP- and C5a-induced calcium moblisation [[cite:PUB00054101]]. By influencing 2 related receptors with very different ligand specificities (C5aR and FPR), the protein has a unique role; nevertheless, neither the manner in which it binds such structurally different molecules nor how its expression is regulated are currently unknown [[cite:PUB00054101]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of a CHIPS fragment (residues 31-121) has been solved by NMR spectroscopy [[cite:PUB00038277]]. This fragment has the same activity in blocking the C5aR relative to full-length CHIPS, but lacks FPR antagonism [[cite:PUB00038277]]. The protein has a compact fold comprising 2 short α-helices packed onto a 4-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet: strands-2 and -3 are joined by a loop with a well-defined conformation [[cite:PUB00038277]]. The protein shares a high degree of structural similarity with a number of proteins, including the C-terminal domain of staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins (SSLs) 5 and 7, staphyloccocal and streptococcal superantigens TSST-1 and SPE-C, and various domains of the staphylococcal extracellullar adherence protein (EAP) [[cite:PUB00038277]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038529", "name" "FPRL1/chemotaxis inhibitory protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02036" "Chemotaxis inhibitory protein"}, "pfam" {"PF11434" "Chemotaxis-inhibiting protein CHIPS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chemotaxis inhibitory protein", "short" "CHIPS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 50, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020986", :literature {"PUB00038277" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Haas PJ" "de Haas CJ" "Poppelier MJ" "van Kessel KP" "van Strijp JA" "Dijkstra K" "Scheek RM" "Fan H" "Kruijtzer JA" "Liskamp RM" "Kemmink J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
