{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcription elongation factor Spt5 is found in both eukaryotes and archaea.  Spt5 forms a heterodimer with Spt4 and collaborates with other transcription factors to pause or promote RNA polymerase II transcription elongation [[cite:PUB00090193]]. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans, including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles [[cite:PUB00012261]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ytl", "name" "Structure of the KOW2-KOW3 Domain of Transcription Elongation Factor Spt5."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11125" "SUPPRESSOR OF TY 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription elongation factor SPT5", "short" "SPT5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 68, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2416, "taxa" 8692, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6985, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6985, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4042}, "pathways" 55}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039659", :literature {"PUB00012261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Winston F."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11182892", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "Control of eukaryotic transcription elongation.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS1006", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11182892}, "PUB00090193" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Anderson SJ" "Sikes ML" "Zhang Y" "French SL" "Salgia S" "Beyer AL" "Nomura M" "Schneider DA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
