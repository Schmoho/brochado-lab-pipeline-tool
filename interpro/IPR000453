{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chorismate synthase (CS; 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate phospholyase; 1-carboxyvinyl-3-phosphoshikimate phosphate-lyase; E.C. 4.2.3.5) catalyzes the seventh and final step in the shikimate pathway which is used in prokaryotes, fungi and plants for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. It catalyzes the 1,4-trans elimination of the phosphate group from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) to form chorismate which can then be used in phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan biosynthesis. Chorismate synthase requires the presence of a reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2 or FADH2) for its activity. Chorismate synthase from various sources shows a high degree of sequence conservation [[cite:PUB00002667], [cite:PUB00003811]]. It is a protein of about 360 to 400 amino-acid residues.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the capacity of these enzymes to regenerate the reduced form of FMN, chorismate synthases are divided into two groups: enzymes, mostly from plants and eubacteria, that sequester CS from the cellular environment, are monofunctional, while those that can generate reduced FMN at the expense of NADPH, such as found in fungi and the ciliated protozoan Euglena gracilis, are bifunctional, having an additional NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase activity. Recently, bifunctionality of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme (MtCS) was determined by measurements of both chorismate synthase and NADH:FMN oxidoreductase activities. Since shikimate pathway enzymes are present in bacteria, fungi and apicomplexan parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and Cryptosporidium parvum) but absent in mammals, they are potentially attractive targets for the development of new therapy against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) [[cite:PUB00079715], [cite:PUB00079716], [cite:PUB00079717], [cite:PUB00079718], [cite:PUB00030526], [cite:PUB00039012], [cite:PUB00030073], [cite:PUB00031826], [cite:PUB00030439], [cite:PUB00079719]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1um0", "name" "Crystal structure of chorismate synthase complexed with FMN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035904", "name" "Chorismate synthase AroC superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07304" "Chorismase synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of the shikimate pathway"}, "hamap" {"MF_00300" "Chorismate synthase [aroC]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001456" "Chorismate synthase"}, "panther" {"PTHR21085" "CHORISMATE SYNTHASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00033" "chorismate synthase"}, "pfam" {"PF01264" "Chorismate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chorismate synthase", "short" "Chorismate_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 119, "proteomes" 10654, "taxa" 39900, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46494, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46443, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35049}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00628", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00628"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1234", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1234"} {"accession" "GenProp1291", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1291"} {"accession" "GenProp1478", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1478"} {"accession" "GenProp1538", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1538"} {"accession" "GenProp1309", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1309"} {"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"} {"accession" "GenProp1550", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1550"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
