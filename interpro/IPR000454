{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit C (also called subunit 9, or proteolipid) found in the F0 complex of F-ATPases. Ten C subunits form an oligomeric ring that makes up the F0 rotor. The flux of protons through the ATPase channel drives the rotation of the C subunit ring, which in turn is coupled to the rotation of the F1 complex gamma subunit rotor due to the permanent binding between the gamma and epsilon subunits of F1 and the C subunit ring of F0. The sequential protonation and deprotonation of Asp61 of subunit C is coupled to the stepwise movement of the rotor [[cite:PUB00020632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Transmembrane ATPases are membrane-bound enzyme complexes/ion transporters that use ATP hydrolysis to drive the transport of protons across a membrane.

Both the F1 and F0 complexes are rotary motors that are coupled back-to-back. In the F1 complex, the central gamma subunit forms the rotor inside the cylinder made of the α(3)β(3) subunits, while in the F0 complex, the ring-shaped C subunits forms the rotor. The two rotors rotate in opposite directions, but the F0 rotor is usually stronger, using the force from the proton gradient to push the F1 rotor in reverse in order to drive ATP synthesis  [[cite:PUB00009752]].
