{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial proteins, including N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (AmiA) from Bacteroides uniformis (BACUNI_02947, [swissprot:A7V5T8]). This highly specific enzyme hydrolyses GlcNAc-1,6-anhydro-MurNAc-peptide into disaccharide and stem peptide. It shows an α/β/α three-layered sandwich fold with a catalytic core that consists of a central five-stranded β-sheet and four α-helices. It is structurally related to NlpC/P60 γ-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid amidases [[cite:PUB00100890]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4q68", "name" "Crystal structure of a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (BACUNI_02947) from Bacteroides uniformis ATCC 8492 at 1.07 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038765", "name" "Papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07313" "N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase-like", "short" "AmiA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 585, "taxa" 3488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4063, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3138}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010846", :literature {"PUB00100890" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Xu Q" "Mengin-Lecreulx D" "Patin D" "Grant JC" "Chiu HJ" "Jaroszewski L" "Knuth MW" "Godzik A" "Lesley SA" "Elsliger MA" "Deacon AM" "Wilson IA."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structure-guided functional characterization of DUF1460 reveals a highly specific NlpC/P60 amidase family.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1799-1809", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25465128}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010846", "name" "N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 621}}}
