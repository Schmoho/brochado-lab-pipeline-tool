{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase ([ec:1.4.3.5]) is an enzyme that is involved in the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and pyridoxal phosphate. It oxidizes pyridoxamine-5-P (PMP) and pyridoxine-5-P (PNP) to pyridoxal-5-P. The enzyme requires the presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor, although there is some evidence that coenzyme F420 may perform this role in some species [[cite:PUB00055044]].</p>\n\n<p>The sequences of the enzyme from bacterial (genes pdxH or fprA) [[cite:PUB00002199]] and fungal (gene PDX3) [[cite:PUB00002264]] sources show that this protein has been highly conserved throughout evolution. PdxH is evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00001735]] to one of the enzymes in the phenazine biosynthesis protein pathway, phzD (also known as phzG) [[cite:PUB00155385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents a subfamily that is widespread in Cyanobacteria and plants, and is named for alr4036 from Nostoc sp.
