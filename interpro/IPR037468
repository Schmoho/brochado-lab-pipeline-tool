{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Overexpression of ARGOS in Arabidopsis increases lateral organ size through prolonged expression of transcription factor ANT, which affects cell proliferation during organ growth [[cite:PUB00086997]]. ARGOS-LIKE (ARL) is an ARGOS homologue that appears to regulate organ growth mainly by influencing cell expansion rather than cell proliferation [[cite:PUB00086996]]. There is only one orthologue of ARGOS in rice (OsARGOS); its overexpression affects organ growth by promoting both cell proliferation and expansion [[cite:PUB00086998]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARGOS and OsARGOS are induced by the phytohormones auxin and cytokinin, whereas ARL is induced by brassinosteroid (BR) [[cite:PUB00086997], [cite:PUB00086998]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organ size related 1 (OSR1) from Arabidopsis is involved in regulation of organ growth and overall organ size.
