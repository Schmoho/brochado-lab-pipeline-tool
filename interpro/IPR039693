{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Rtr1 from budding yeasts and its homologues, including RPAP2 from humans. Homologues are known from animals, plants and fungi.  Rtr1 and Rtr2 are paralogues. Rtr1 is a RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-binding protein. It is responsible for the transition of PolII into the elongation and termination phases of transcription by removing RNAPII CTD serine 5 phosphorylation (Ser5-P) at a selection of target genes [[cite:PUB00089987], [cite:PUB00089988]].</p>\n\n<p>Human RPAP2 is a CTD phosphatase that interacts directly with the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb6 and participates in pre-mRNA 3'-end formation [[cite:PUB00089989]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038534", "name" "Rtr1/RPAP2 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14732" "RNA POLYMERASE II SUBUNIT B1 CTD PHOSPHATASE RPAP2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rtr1/RPAP2", "short" "Rtr1/RPAP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2228, "taxa" 7593, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3984, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2535}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
