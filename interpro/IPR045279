{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Plant response regulators (RRs, called ARRs in Arabidopsis thaliana) are a class of MYB-type transcription factors that act as major players in the transcriptional activation of cytokinin-responsive genes. They directly regulate the expression of type-A ARR genes and other downstream target genes. Cytokinin is a plant hormone implicated in many growth and development processes including shoot organogenesis, leaf senescence, sink/source relationships, vascular development, lateral bud release, and photomorphogenic development. Cytokinin signaling involves a phosphorelay cascade by histidine kinase receptors (AHKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and downstream ARRs [[cite:PUB00098462], [cite:PUB00098463], [cite:PUB00098464]].</p>\n\n<p>ARRs are divided into two groups, type-A and -B, according to their sequence and domain structure. Type-A ARRs contain a central receiver domain along with short N- and C-terminal extensions and are transcriptionally induced by cytokinin. Type-B ARRs contain a receiver domain followed by a DNA binding domain and function as transcription factors [[cite:PUB00098461]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43874" "TWO-COMPONENT RESPONSE REGULATOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Two-component response regulator ARR-like", "short" "ARR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 315, "taxa" 1703, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14512, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14512, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8810}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045279", :literature {"PUB00098462" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["D'Agostino IB" "Deruere J" "Kieber JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Characterization of the response of the Arabidopsis response regulator gene family to cytokinin.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1706-17", "volume" "124", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11115887}, "PUB00098463" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Argueso CT" "Raines T" "Kieber JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Opin Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Opin Plant Biol", "title" "Cytokinin signaling and transcriptional networks.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "533-9", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20851038}, "PUB00098464" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["To JP" "Haberer G" "Ferreira FJ" "Deruere J" "Mason MG" "Schaller GE" "Alonso JM" "Ecker JR" "Kieber JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Type-A Arabidopsis response regulators are partially redundant negative regulators of cytokinin signaling.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "658-71", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14973166}, "PUB00098461" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Mason MG" "Mathews DE" "Argyros DA" "Maxwell BB" "Kieber JJ" "Alonso JM" "Ecker JR" "Schaller GE."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Multiple type-B response regulators mediate cytokinin signal transduction in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3007-18", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16227453}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009736", "name" "cytokinin-activated signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045279", "name" "Two-component response regulator ARR-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017053", "name" "Response regulator B-type, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
