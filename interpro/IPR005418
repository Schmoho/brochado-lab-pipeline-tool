{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The zona occuldens proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3) are a family of tight junction associated proteins that function as cross-linkers, anchoring the TJ strand proteins to the actin-based cytoskeleton [[cite:PUB00007799]]. Each protein contains three PDZ (postsynaptic density, disc-large, ZO-1) domains, a single SH3 (Src Homology-3) domain and a catalytically inactive  GK (guanylate kinase) domain, the presence of which identifies them as members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family. The signature PDZ-SH3-GuK tandem of MAGUKs may form a structural supramodule with three domains interacting with each other to assemble into an integral structural unit [[cite:PUB00085529], [cite:PUB00057053]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents ZO-1, which was first identified as a 220kDa antigen for a monoclonal antibody raised to junction-enriched cell fractions [[cite:PUB00007802]]. The protein shares ~65% overall similarity with ZO-2 and ZO-3 proteins, with highest levels of similarity in the MAGUK and acid domains. The structure of ZO-1 is distinct from the other ZO protein family members in that it contains a ZU5 domain at the C-terminal end of the molecule, although the function of this domain is unknown. Binding and tranfection studies indicate that ZO-1 is capable of associating with ZO-2 and ZO-3 through binding of the second PDZ domains [[cite:PUB00007803]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01598" "ZONOCCLUDNS1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tight junction protein ZO-1", "short" "ZO-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 539, "taxa" 1868, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6425, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2184, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 55}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005418", :literature {"PUB00007799" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Itoh M" "Nagafuchi A" "Moroi S" "Tsukita S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
