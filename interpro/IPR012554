{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the DegQ (formerly sacQ) regulatory peptides. The DegQ family of peptides control the rates of synthesis of a class of both secreted and intracellular degradative enzymes in Bacillus subtilis and related bacteria [[cite:PUB00151479], [cite:PUB00151320], [cite:PUB00151319]]. DegQ is 46 amino acids long and activates the synthesis of degradative enzymes. The expression of this peptide was shown to be subjected both to catabolite repression and DegS-DegU-mediated control. Thus allowing an increase in the rate of synthesis of DegQ under conditions of nitrogen starvation [[cite:PUB00016418]]. DegQ also affects lipopeptide production and formation of secretory proteases [[cite:PUB00151479]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041457" "degradation enzyme regulation protein DegQ"}, "pfam" {"PF08181" "DegQ (SacQ) family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Degradation enzyme regulation protein DegQ", "short" "DegQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 88, "sets" 0, "proteins" 88, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 58}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012554", :literature {"PUB00016418" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Msadek T" "Kunst F" "Henner D" "Klier A" "Rapoport G" "Dedonder R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
