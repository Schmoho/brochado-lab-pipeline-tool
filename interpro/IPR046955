{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of plant proteins includes Myb family transcription factor protein PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (PHR1) and similar proteins from plants, including PHLs from A.thaliana and MPH1/MOF1 from rice. They belong to a family of MYB-CC transcription factors and are regarded as the key components of the central regulatory system controlling plant transcriptional responses to phosphate (Pi) starvation [[cite:PUB00097328], [cite:PUB00097329], [cite:PUB00097331]].</p>\n\n<p>PHR1 is a transcription factor and a master regulator of phosphate starvation responses (PSRs) [[cite:PUB00074769]].</p>\n\n<p>PHL1 (PHR1-LIKE 1), PHL2, and perhaps also PHL3, act redundantly with PHR1 to regulate plant Pi starvation responses [[cite:PUB00097329]]. However, PHL4 has only a minor role in the regulation of plant responses to Pi starvation [[cite:PUB00097329]]. PHL10 (also known as MYR1) acts redundantly with PHL9 (also known as MYR2) as a repressor of flowering and organ elongation under decreased light intensity [[cite:PUB00097330]].</p>\n\n<p>MPH1 is likely a transcription factor involved in the regulation of plant height by elongating internode cell length [[cite:PUB00101456]]. It is involved in the positive regulation of grain yield [[cite:PUB00101456]]. MPH may play a role in the regulation of genes related to cell elongation and cell wall synthesis, which are associated with plant height and yield phenotypes [[cite:PUB00101456]]. It also plays a role in tolerance to cadmium stress [[cite:PUB00101455]].</p>\n\n<p>MOF1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet meristem determinacy [[cite:PUB00101457]]. It interacts with the TPR corepressors to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes [[cite:PUB00101457]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6j4k", "name" "Structural basis for the target DNA recognition and binding by the MYB domain of phosphate starvation response 1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31499" "MYB FAMILY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR PHL11", "PTHR31314" "MYB FAMILY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR PHL7-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myb family transcription factor PHR1-like", "short" "PHR1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 297, "taxa" 1289, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13258, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13258, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7911}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046955", :literature {"PUB00074769" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Puga MI" "Mateos I" "Charukesi R" "Wang Z" "Franco-Zorrilla JM" "de Lorenzo L" "Irigoyen ML" "Masiero S" "Bustos R" "Rodriguez J" "Leyva A" "Rubio V" "Sommer H" "Paz-Ares J."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
