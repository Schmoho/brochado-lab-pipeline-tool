{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of proteins phosphorylated in the M (mitotic) phase, known as M-phase phosphoprotein 9 (MPHOSPH9 or MPP9) [[cite:PUB00060868]]. MPHOSPH9 appears to localise to the distal and proximal end of centriole pairs in duplicated centrosomes. Following centrosome splitting it is no longer visible, suggesting a role in the early steps of the centrosome cycle. In ciliated cells, it localises to the distal and proximal end of daughter centriole and proximal but not distal end of the mother centriole, suggesting that it may have a role in ciliogenesis [[cite:PUB00060832]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14926" "M-PHASE PHOSPHOPROTEIN 9"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "M-phase phosphoprotein 9", "short" "MPHOSPH9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 633, "taxa" 2275, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1466, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1466, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 909}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026636", :literature {"PUB00060868" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Matsumoto-Taniura N" "Pirollet F" "Monroe R" "Gerace L" "Westendorf JM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
