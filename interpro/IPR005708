{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alkaptonuria (AKU), a rare hereditary disorder, was the first disease to be interpreted as an inborn error of metabolism. The deficiency causes homogentisic aciduria, ochronosis, and arthritis. AKU patients are deficient for homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD) ([ec:1.13.11.5]), the enzyme that mediates the conversion of homogentisate to maleylacetoacetate, a step in the catabolism of both tyrosine and phenylalanine. The structure of this protein shows that the enzyme forms a hexamer arrangement comprised of a dimer of trimers. The active site iron ion is coordinated near the interface between the trimers [[cite:PUB00101169], [cite:PUB00009903]].</p>\n\n<p>This group of proteins includes human HDG and homologues from eukaryotes, bacteria and some archaeal species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zds", "name" "Structure of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase in complex with reaction intermediates of homogentisate with oxygen."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01015" "homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11056" "HOMOGENTISATE 1,2-DIOXYGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase", "short" "Homogentis_dOase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5800, "taxa" 20535, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20602, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20593, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14827}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0139", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0139"} {"accession" "GenProp1375", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1375"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
