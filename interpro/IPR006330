{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenosine deaminases ([ec:3.5.4.4]) are monomeric zinc dependent enzymes involved in purine metabolism. They are required for the breakdown of adenosine from food and for the turnover of nucleic acids in tissues. Adenosine deaminases convert adenosine to the related nucleoside inosine by the substitution of the amino group for a hydroxyl group. These enzymes are distantly related to AMP deaminases [[cite:PUB00000343]] as they share three regions of sequence similarities; these regions are centred on residues which are proposed to play an important role in the catalytic mechanism of these two enzymes.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes a group of adenine deaminases more related to the bacterial and eukaryotic adenosine deaminases than to Bacillus subtilis adenine deaminase and its bacterial homologues [[cite:PUB00059155]]. Adenine deaminase catalyses the hydrolytic deamination of adenine to hypoxanthine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3mvi", "name" "Crystal structure of holo mADA at 1.6 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11409" "ADENOSINE DEAMINASE", "PTHR43114" "ADENINE DEAMINASE"}, "cdd" {"cd01320" "ADA"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01430" "adenosine deaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenosine/adenine deaminase", "short" "Ado/ade_deaminase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 64, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7285, "taxa" 27896, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46056, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33264}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1741", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1741"} {"accession" "GenProp1323", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1323"} {"accession" "GenProp1255", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1255"} {"accession" "GenProp1568", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1568"} {"accession" "GenProp1278", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1278"} {"accession" "GenProp1235", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1235"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
