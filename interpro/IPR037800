{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes histone acetyltransferases GCN5, KAT2A and KAT2B (all of which are included in [ec:2.3.1.48]). GCN5 acetylates histones H2B, H3 and H4, providing a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. GCN5 is a component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA [[cite:PUB00078415]], SLIK [[cite:PUB00087618]], SALSA [[cite:PUB00063471]] and ADA [[cite:PUB00062949]]. Mammals have two paralogues: KAT2A (also known as GCN5) and KAT2B. KAT2A acetylates core histones to provide a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation, but not nucleosome core particles. It also acetylates proteins such as CEBPB [[cite:PUB00087644]]. KAT2A is a component of the ATAC complex, which has acetyltransferase activity on histones H3 and H4 [[cite:PUB00053704]]. KAT2B (also known as P300/calcium-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor or PCAF) can acetylate the core histones H3 and H4 as well as nucleosome core particles and non-histone proteins such as ACLY [[cite:PUB00075004]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The transcription regulatory histone acetylation complex Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes.
