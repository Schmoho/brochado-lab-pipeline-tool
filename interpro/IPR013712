{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Myo2p, a class V myosin, is essential for mitochondrial distribution, class V being vital for organelle distribution in S. cerevisiae. The established mechanism for distribution of cellular components by class V myosins is that they interact with the cargo at the C-terminal tail domain and transport it along the actin cytoskeleton using the N-terminal motor domain. Cargo-specific myosin receptors act as the link between the myosin tail and cargo. Myo2 binds with MMR1 (mitochondrial Myo2p receptor-related protein 1), the receptor on cargo, via the C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00057250]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08505" "Mitochondrial Myo2 receptor-related protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial Myo2 receptor-related protein 1", "short" "MMR1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 97, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 68, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 45}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013712", :literature {"PUB00057250" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Itoh T" "Toh-E A" "Matsui Y."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600271", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Mmr1p is a mitochondrial factor for Myo2p-dependent inheritance of mitochondria in the budding yeast.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "2520-30", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15201867}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR013712", "name" "Mitochondrial Myo2 receptor-related protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 28}}}
