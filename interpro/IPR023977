{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this rare protein family regularly occur next to a member of the MXAN_0977 subfamily ([interpro:IPR023929]) of the di-heme cytochrome c peroxidase/MauG family ([interpro:IPR004852]). MauG itself ([interpro:IPR022394]) is a protein modification enzyme responsible for the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) modification involved in methylamine dehydrogenase activation. Members of this family have motif WxW, the first Trp of which is post-translationally modified by the MauG-like protein. All members of this family have a motif of four spaced invariant Cys residues, while additional homologues outside the scope of this family lack the four Cys residues. The protein member from methanobactin producer Methylosinus trichosporium Strain OB3b ([swissprot:A0A2D2CY67]), which is encoded just three genes away from methanobactin biosynthesis cassette protein MbnC, is designated MbnP, and is a copper-binding protein. It may be a methanobactin copper release protein [[cite:PUB00060471], [cite:PUB00153588]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04052" "MbnP family copper-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Copper-binding protein MbnP-like", "short" "MbnP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 210, "taxa" 1288, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 839, "sets" 0, "proteins" 839, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 605}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0940", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0940"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023977", :literature {"PUB00153588" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Manesis AC" "Jodts RJ" "Hoffman BM" "Rosenzweig AC."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100680118", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Copper binding by a unique family of metalloproteins is dependent on kynurenine formation.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e2100680118", "volume" "118", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34074779}, "PUB00060471" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["Krentz BD" "Mulheron HJ" "Semrau JD" "Dispirito AA" "Bandow NL" "Haft DH" "Vuilleumier S" "Murrell JC" "McEllistrem MT" "Hartsel SC" "Gallagher WH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi1014375", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "A comparison of methanobactins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and Methylocystis strain Sb2 predicts methanobactins are synthesized from diverse peptide precursors modified to create a common core for binding and reducing copper ions.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "10117-30", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20961038}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023977", "name" "Copper-binding protein MbnP-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
