{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SARAF is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane resident protein that serves as a negative regulator of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) involved in protecting cells from Ca2+ overfilling. It is a single pass ER membrane protein whose systolic-facing domain is responsible for activity and whose luminary-facing domain carries out a regulatory function in conjunction with another membrane protein STIM, an ER single pass membrane protein that detects changes in ER Ca2+ levels through its EF-hand, conserved Ca2+ binding domain. STIM is the major target for SARAF regulation, and thus SARAF negatively regulates the SOCE entry of calcium into cells protecting them from overfilling [[cite:PUB00075537]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6o2u", "name" "Crystal structure of the SARAF luminal domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06682" "SOCE-associated regulatory factor of calcium homoeostasis"}, "panther" {"PTHR15929" "STORE-OPERATED CALCIUM ENTRY-ASSOCIATED REGULATORY FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Store-operated calcium entry-associated regulatory factor", "short" "SARAF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 45, "proteomes" 1820, "taxa" 5835, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3016, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2902, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1879}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009567", :literature {"PUB00075537" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Palty R" "Raveh A" "Kaminsky I" "Meller R" "Reuveny E."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.055", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "SARAF inactivates the store operated calcium entry machinery to prevent excess calcium refilling.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "425-38", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22464749}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:2001256", "name" "regulation of store-operated calcium entry", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005789", "name" "endoplasmic reticulum membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009567", "name" "Store-operated calcium entry-associated regulatory factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 43, "alignment:full" 1801}}}
