{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several animal EURL proteins. EURL is preferentially expressed in chick retinal precursor cells as well as in the anterior epithelial cells of the lens at early stages of development. EURL transcripts are found primarily in the peripheral dorsal retina, i.e., the most undifferentiated part of the dorsal retina. EURL transcripts are also detected in the lens at stage 18 and remain abundant in the proliferating epithelial cells of the lens until at least day 11. The distribution pattern of EURL in the developing retina and lens suggest a role before the events leading to cell determination and differentiation [[cite:PUB00012937]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15961" "PROTEIN EURL HOMOLOG"}, "pfam" {"PF06937" "EURL protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EURL protein", "short" "EURL_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 655, "taxa" 2295, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1053, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1024, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 714}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009704", :literature {"PUB00012937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Godbout R" "Andison R" "Katyal S" "Bisgrove DA."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
