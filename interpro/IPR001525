{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylases ([ec:2.1.1.37]) (C5 Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the C-5 carbon of cytosines in DNA to produce C5-methylcytosine [[cite:PUB00001771], [cite:PUB00004446], [cite:PUB00003244]]. In mammalian cells, cytosine-specific methyltransferases methylate certain CpG sequences, which are believed to modulate gene expression and cell differentiation. In bacteria, these enzymes are a component of restriction-modification systems and serve as valuable tools for the manipulation of DNA [[cite:PUB00001090], [cite:PUB00004446]]. The structure of HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI) has been resolved to 2.5 A [[cite:PUB00000896]]: the molecule folds into 2 domains - a larger catalytic domain containing catalytic and cofactor binding sites, and a smaller DNA recognition domain.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes tRNA (cytosine(38)-C(5))-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.204]), also known as DNMT2 (DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-like protein 2), that specifically methylates cytosine 38 in the anticodon loop of tRNA (Asp) [[cite:PUB00058132]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1g55", "name" "Structure of human DNMT2, an enigmatic DNA methyltransferase homologue"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51679" "C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase (Dnmt) domain profile"}, "pfam" {"PF00145" "C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00675" "DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase"}, "prints" {"PR00105" "C5METTRFRASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-5 cytosine methyltransferase", "short" "C5_MeTfrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 125, "domain_architectures" 778, "proteomes" 8347, "taxa" 34187, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 71615, "sets" 0, "proteins" 69723, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 45833}, "pathways" 162}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00089", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00089"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0767", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0767"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
