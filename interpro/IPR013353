{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include YscB of Yersinia and functionally equivalent (but differently named) proteins from type III secretion systems of other pathogens that affect animal cells. In Yersinia pestis, the secretion of effector proteins, termed Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), is regulated by the activity of the YopN/SycN/YscB/TyeA complex. YscB acts, along with SycN ([interpro:IPR012673]), as a chaperone for YopN, a key part of a complex that regulates type III secretion so that it responds to contact with the eukaryotic target cell [[cite:PUB00020751], [cite:PUB00069641]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1xkp", "name" "Crystal structure of the virulence factor YopN in complex with its heterodimeric chaperone SycN-YscB"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02513" "YscB family type III secretion system chaperone"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system chaperone YscB", "short" "T3SS_YscB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 146, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 130, "sets" 0, "proteins" 130, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 98}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013353", :literature {"PUB00020751" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Schubot FD" "Jackson MW" "Penrose KJ" "Cherry S" "Tropea JE" "Plano GV" "Waugh DS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
