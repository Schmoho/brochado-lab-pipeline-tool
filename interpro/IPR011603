{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in the TCA cycle, converting 2-oxoglutarate, coenzyme A and NAD(+) to succinyl-CoA, NADH and carbon dioxide [[cite:PUB00033922]]. This activity of this enzyme is tightly regulated and it is a major determinant of the metabolic flux through the TCA cycle. This enzyme is composed of multiple copies of three different subunits: 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) which is often shared with similar enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00033923]]. The E2 component forms a large multimeric core which binds the peripheral E1 and E3 subunits. The substrate is transferred between the active sites of the different subunits by a lipoyl moiety, bound to a lysine residue from the E2 polypeptide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The E1 subunit of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase catalyses the decarboxylation of this compound in a thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent manner, transferring the resultant succinyl group onto the liposyl moiety bound to the E2 subunit. The E1 ortholog from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Brevibacterium flavum) is unusual in having an N-terminal extension that resembles the E2 component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6r29", "name" "Crystal structure of the SucA domain of Mycobacterium smegmatis KGD cocrystallized with succinylphosphonate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042179", "name" "Multifunctional 2-oxoglutarate metabolism enzyme, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00239" "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 component"}, "panther" {"PTHR23152" "2-OXOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000157" "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, E1 component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 component", "short" "2oxoglutarate_DH_E1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9386, "taxa" 32653, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43228, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42011, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29394}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp1348", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1348"} {"accession" "GenProp1487", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1487"} {"accession" "GenProp0630", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0630"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
