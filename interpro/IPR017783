{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Partial phylogenetic profiling [[cite:PUB00034422]] suggests that the ABC transporter periplasmic binding proteins in this entry are involved in choline uptake for glycine betaine biosynthesis. Genomes often carry several paralogs, one encoded together with the permease and ATP-binding components, and another encoded next to a choline-sulphatase gene, suggesting that different members of this protein family interact with shared components and give some flexibility in substrate. Of the two proteins from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, one designated ChoX has been shown experimentally to bind choline (though not various related compounds such as betaine) and to be required for about 60 % of choline uptake [[cite:PUB00042950]]. In A. tumefaciens, the ABC-type choline transporter is encoded by the chromosomally located choXWV operon (ChoX, binding protein; ChoW, permease; and ChoV, ATPase). The ChoXWV transporter functions as a high-affinity choline transporter [[cite:PUB00062319]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2rin", "name" "ABC-transporter choline binding protein in complex with acetylcholine"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13640" "Substrate binding domain of ABC-type choline transport system; the type 2 periplasmic binding protein fold"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03414" "choline ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Choline ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein", "short" "ABC_choline_sub-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 954, "taxa" 3984, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7240, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5874}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0749", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0749"} {"accession" "GenProp0748", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0748"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017783", :literature {"PUB00042950" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Dupont L" "Garcia I" "Poggi MC" "Alloing G" "Mandon K" "Le Rudulier D."], "ISO_journal" "J.
