{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The CD8 alpha subunit is a component of the CD8 α-β heterodimer and is additionally found as a homodimeric complex [[cite:PUB00034830]]. Both of these species assist in the recognition of MHC class I-peptide complexes by the α-β T cell receptor (TCR). CD8 binds to constant regions of the peptide-MHC complex and augments antigen-specific interactions that are formed by the TCR [[cite:PUB00034831]]. Additionally, CD8 is directly coupled to TCR signalling by virtue of its interactions with the p56Lck kinase [[cite:PUB00034832]], as well as other proteins. CD8 expression is limited to and one of the defining characteristics of cytolytic T cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ebg", "name" "Crystal structure of bovine CD8aa homodimer"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10441" "CD8 ALPHA CHAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CD8 alpha subunit", "short" "CD8_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 560, "taxa" 1995, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 831}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015468", :literature {"PUB00034830" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Devine L" "Kavathas PB."], "ISO_journal" "Immunol.
