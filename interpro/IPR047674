They  are predicted to fold into an Î±-helical hairpin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040514" "CAL67264 family membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CAL67264-like", "short" "CAL67264-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 311, "taxa" 989, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 914, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 757}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047674", :literature {"PUB00105807" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Gupta RS" "Lorenzini E."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Evol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Evol Biol", "title" "Phylogeny and molecular signatures (conserved proteins and indels) that are specific for the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "71", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17488508}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047674", "name" "CAL67264-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
