{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The family of proteins found in this family include the characterised LysX from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> [[cite:PUB00015489]] which is part of a well-organised lysine biosynthesis gene cluster [[cite:PUB00015490]].  LysX is believed to carry out an ATP-dependent acylation of the amino group of alpha-aminoadipate in the prokaryotic version of the fungal AAA lysine biosynthesis pathway.  No species having a sequence in this family contains the elements of the more common diaminopimelate lysine biosythesis pathway, and none has been shown to be a lysine auxotroph.  These sequences have mainly recieved the name of the related enzyme, \"ribosomal protein bS6 modification protein RimK\".  RimK has been characterised in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and acts by ATP-dependent condensation of bS6 with glutamate residues [[cite:PUB00015491]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3vpd", "name" "LysX from Thermus thermophilus complexed with AMP-PNP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02144" "lysine biosynthesis enzyme LysX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysine biosynthesis enzyme LysX", "short" "LysX_arch"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 294, "taxa" 1943, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2333, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2333, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1898}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0193", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0193"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
