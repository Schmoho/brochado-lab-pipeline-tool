{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Marine teleosts from polar oceans can be protected from freezing in icy sea-water by serum antifreeze proteins (AFPs) or glycoproteins (AFGPs) [[cite:PUB00005033]]. These function by binding to, and preventing the growth of, ice crystals within the fish. Despite functional similarity, the proteins are structurally diverse and include glycosylated and at least 3 non-glycosylated forms: the AFGP of nototheniids and cod are polymers of a tripeptide repeat, Ala-Ala-Thr, with a disaccharide attached to the threonine residue; type I AFPs are Ala-rich, α-helical peptides found in flounder and sculpin; type II AFPs of sea-raven, smelt and herring are Cys-rich proteins; and type III AFPs, found in Eel pouts, are rich in β-structure. Although no direct structural information is available for type II AFPs, their sequences are similar to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lectins. This domain is present in a superfamily of proteins that bind sugars specifically through contact with a calcium ion. The extent of similarity within the superfamily is confined to short motifs and single amino acids at intervals throughout the protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zib", "name" "Crystal structure analysis of calcium-independent type II antifreeze protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016187", "name" "C-type lectin fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016186", "name" "C-type lectin-like/link domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00356" "ANTIFREEZEII"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type-2 ice-structuring protein", "short" "AntifreezeII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 88, "taxa" 488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 959, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 579}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002353", :literature {"PUB00005033" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sonnichsen FD" "Sykes BD" "Davies PL."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=7540906&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Comparative modeling of the three-dimensional structure of type II antifreeze protein.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "460-71", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7540906}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002353", "name" "Type-2 ice-structuring protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
