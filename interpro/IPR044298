{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes DNA glycosylases involved in DNA damage repair, including Adenine-DNA glycosylase MutY and its homologues (MutYH) and Thymine-DNA glycosylase MIG. MutY plays an important role in the prevention of DNA mutations resulting from the presence of the oxidatively damaged lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OxoG). 8-OxoG can mispair with 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate or with 2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate during DNA replication, forming C*8-oxoG and A*8-oxoG mispairs. If unrepaired, the A=8-oxoG mispairs can result in deleterious C:G to A:T transversions. MutY, with its DNA glycosylase activity, excises adenine paired with guanine or 8-oxoG [[cite:PUB00068371]]. Mutations in this enzyme cause MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) which results in the accumulation of G:T mismatched DNA caused by oxidative damage [[cite:PUB00095767]]. MIG excises thymine from T/G mismatches and it also has a weak DNA glycosylase activity on uracil paired with various bases [[cite:PUB00095766]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ef9", "name" "Crystal structure of mouse MUTYH in complex with DNA containing AP site analogue:8-oxoG (Form II)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011257", "name" "DNA glycosylase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023170", "name" "Helix-hairpin-helix, base-excision DNA repair, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42944" "ADENINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenine/Thymine-DNA glycosylase", "short" "MIG/MutY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10011, "taxa" 37081, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41346, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41346, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31224}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
