{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of pindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad1. The mitotic spindle checkpoint monitors proper attachment of the bipolar spindle to the kinetochores of aligned sister chromatids and causes a cell cycle arrest in prometaphase when failures occur. Multiple components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the existence of a Mad1-dependent complex containing Mad2, Mad3, Bub3 and Cdc20 has been demonstrated [[cite:PUB00011371]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4dzo", "name" "Structure of Human Mad1 C-terminal Domain Reveals Its Involvement in Kinetochore Targeting"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05557" "Mitotic checkpoint protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR23168" "MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT PROTEIN MAD1 MITOTIC ARREST DEFICIENT-LIKE PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spindle assembly checkpoint component Mad1", "short" "Mad1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 74, "proteomes" 2349, "taxa" 8063, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4975, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4773, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2997}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008672", :literature {"PUB00011371" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wassmann K" "Liberal V" "Benezra R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdg071", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Mad2 phosphorylation regulates its association with Mad1 and the APC/C.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "797-806", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12574116}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007094", "name" "mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint signaling", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008672", "name" "Spindle assembly checkpoint component Mad1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 2876}}}
