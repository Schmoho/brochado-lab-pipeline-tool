{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents HrpB, one of two related predicted DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicases of unknown function found in many proteobacteria, but also in a few species of other lineages. The member from Rhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti), designated HelO, has been studied but is not essential for growth and mutants have no obvious phenotype [[cite:PUB00033866]]. HrpB is typically about 800 residues in length, while its paralog HrpA ([interpro:IPR010222]), also uncharacterised, is about 1300 amino acids long. Related characterised eukaryotic proteins are RNA helicases associated with pre-mRNA processing [[cite:PUB00033619]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01970" "ATP-dependent helicase HrpB"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005496" "ATP-dependent RNA helicase, HrpB type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent helicase HrpB", "short" "HrpB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3597, "taxa" 13142, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14110, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13742, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10463}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
