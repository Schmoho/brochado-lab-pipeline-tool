{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA-directed RNA polymerases [ec:2.7.7.6] (also known as  DNA-dependent RNA polymerases) are responsible for the polymerisation of ribonucleotides into a sequence complementary to the template DNA. In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases transcribing different sets of genes. Most RNA polymerases are multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits. The core RNA polymerase complex consists of five subunits (two alpha, one beta, one beta-prime and one omega) and is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a \"crab claw\"-like structure with an internal channel running along the full length [[cite:PUB00033173]]. The key functional sites of the enzyme, as defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, are located on the inner wall of this channel.</p>\n\n<p>RNA synthesis follows after the attachment of RNA polymerase to a specific site, the promoter, on the template DNA strand.  The RNA synthesis process continues until a termination sequence is reached. The RNA product, which is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, is known as the primary transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic nuclei contain three distinct types of RNA polymerases that differ in the RNA they synthesise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RNA polymerase I: located in the nucleoli, synthesises precursors of most ribosomal RNAs.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase II: occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises mRNA precursors.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase III: also occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises the precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, the tRNAs, and a variety of other small nuclear and cytosolic RNAs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic cells are also known to contain separate mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA polymerases. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases, whose molecular masses vary in size from 500 to 700kDa, contain two non-identical large (>100kDa) subunits and an array of up to 12 different small (less than 50kDa) subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>RNA polymerase III contains seventeen subunits in yeasts and in human cells. Twelve of these are akin to RNA polymerase I or II and the other five are RNA polymerase III-specific, and form the functionally distinct groups: (i) Rpc31-Rpc34-Rpc82, and (ii) Rpc37-Rpc53. Rpc31, Rpc34 and Rpc82 form a cluster of enzyme-specific subunits that contribute to transcription initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens.
