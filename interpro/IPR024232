{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Stage III sporulation protein AH (SpoIIIAH) is a protein that is involved in forespore engulfment. It forms a channel with SpoIIIAH that is open on the forespore end and closed (or gated) on the mother cell end. This allows sigma-E-directed gene expression in the mother-cell compartment of the sporangium to trigger the activation of sigma-G forespore-specific gene expression by a pathway of intercellular signaling [[cite:PUB00088252]].  This family of proteins is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and so must have a wider function than in sporulation.  Proteins in this family are typically between 174 and 223 amino acids in length.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038503", "name" "Stage III sporulation protein AH-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12685" "SpoIIIAH-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stage III sporulation protein AH-like", "short" "SpoIIIAH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 1167, "taxa" 3788, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3933, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3933, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2840}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024232", :literature {"PUB00088252" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Camp AH" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
