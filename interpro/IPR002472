{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the palmitoyl protein thioesterase family. Its members include palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 and lysosomal thioesterase 2 (PPT1 and PPT2). PPT1 is responsible for the removal of a palmitate group from its substrate proteins, which may include presynaptic proteins like SNAP-25, cysteine string protein (CSP), dynamin, and synaptotagmin [[cite:PUB00072199]]. PPT2 removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups from various substrates including S-palmitoyl-CoA [[cite:PUB00029881]]. PPT1 and -2 perform non-redundant roles in lysosomal thioester catabolism [[cite:PUB00029881]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutations in the PPT1 gene cause infantile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL), which is a severe pediatric neurodegenerative disorder [[cite:PUB00072200]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised proteins from fungi and plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00414" "PPTHIESTRASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Palmitoyl protein thioesterase", "short" "Palm_thioest"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2210, "taxa" 7623, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20720, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4402, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2833}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
