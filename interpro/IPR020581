{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The P protein, also known as Glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), is part of the glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex (GDC), also annotated as glycine cleavage system or glycine synthase. GDC consists of four proteins P, H, L and T [[cite:PUB00009491]]. The P protein ([ec:1.4.4.2]) binds the alpha-amino group of glycine through its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, carbon dioxide is released and the remaining methylamin moiety is then transferred to the lipoamide cofactor of the H protein. The reaction catalysed by this protein is:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>Glycine + lipoylprotein = S-aminomethyldihydrolipoylprotein + CO2</reaction></p>\n\n<p>The subunit composition of glycine cleavage system P proteins have been classified into two types. Those from eukaryotes and some of the P proteins from prokaryotes (e.g. Escherichia coli) are in the homodimeric form. The rest of those from prokaryotes are heterotetrameric, with two different subunits which, based on sequence similarities, correspond respectively to the N and C-terminal halves of the eukaryotic subunit [[cite:PUB00038183]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6i35", "name" "Crystal structure of human glycine decarboxylase (P-protein) bound with pyridoxyl-glycine-5'-monophosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00613" "GDC-P"}, "panther" {"PTHR11773" "GLYCINE DEHYDROGENASE, DECARBOXYLATING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycine cleavage system P protein", "short" "GDC_P"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9797, "taxa" 37730, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 52946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52713, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39337}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0178", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0178"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
