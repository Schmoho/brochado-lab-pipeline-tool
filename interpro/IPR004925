{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4HPA) 3-monooxygenase consists of two components, a large component, HpaB, which is an oxygenase, and a small component, HpaC, which is a reductase. 4-HPA 3-monooxygenase is NADH-dependent and uses FAD as the redox chromophore. HpaB utilises FADH2 supplied by HpaC to catalyse the hydroxylation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, leading to the production of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DHPA) [[cite:PUB00050164]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase oxygenase component, HpaB.
