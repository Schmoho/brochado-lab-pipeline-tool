{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of Myb transcription factors from plants which are involved in a variety of plant developmental processes and stress responses [[cite:PUB00153079]]. Members of the family play crucial roles in anther development, microsporogenesis, and tapetal function, which are essential for pollen development. They are also key regulators of metabolic pathways, such as the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates, which contribute to plant defense against herbivores [[cite:PUB00098010]] Additionally, some MYB proteins are implicated in the plant's response to abiotic stresses, including salt and osmotic stress, by regulating stress-responsive genes and metabolic adjustments [[cite:PUB00155084]]. The family includes proteins that act as probable transcription factors, with some members specifically involved in the regulation of cell wall modification and suberin deposition under stress conditions [[cite:PUB00107896], [cite:PUB00150143]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7fdo", "name" "Crystal structure of transcription factor CPC in complex with EGL3"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10641" "MYB FAMILY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR", "PTHR47999" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MYB8-RELATED-RELATED", "PTHR47994" "F14D16.11-RELATED", "PTHR47998" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MYB51-LIKE ISOFORM X1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myb transcription factor, plants", "short" "Myb_TF_plants"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 263, "taxa" 1902, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29818, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29818, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18668}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015495", :literature {"PUB00153079" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Baldoni E" "Genga A" "Cominelli E."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms160715811", "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Plant MYB Transcription Factors: Their Role in Drought Response Mechanisms.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "15811-51", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26184177}, "PUB00150143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Kirik V" "Lee MM" "Wester K" "Herrmann U" "Zheng Z" "Oppenheimer D" "Schiefelbein J" "Hulskamp M."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Functional diversification of MYB23 and GL1 genes in trichome morphogenesis and initiation.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1477-85", "volume" "132", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15728674}, "PUB00098010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Schweizer F" "Fernandez-Calvo P" "Zander M" "Diez-Diaz M" "Fonseca S" "Glauser G" "Lewsey MG" "Ecker JR" "Solano R" "Reymond P."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 regulate glucosinolate biosynthesis, insect performance, and feeding behavior.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "3117-32", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23943862}, "PUB00107896" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zimmermann IM" "Heim MA" "Weisshaar B" "Uhrig JF."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Comprehensive identification of Arabidopsis thaliana MYB transcription factors interacting with R/B-like BHLH proteins.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "22-34", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15361138}, "PUB00155084" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Zheng Y" "Schumaker KS" "Guo Y."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1202630109", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Sumoylation of transcription factor MYB30 by the small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase SIZ1 mediates abscisic acid response in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "12822-7", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22814374}, "PUB00004032" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6193", "authors" ["Biedenkapp H" "Borgmeyer U" "Sippel AE" "Klempnauer KH."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/335835a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Viral myb oncogene encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "835-7", "volume" "335", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3185713}, "PUB00001152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Klempnauer KH" "Sippel AE."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=2824190", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The highly conserved amino-terminal region of the protein encoded by the v-myb oncogene functions as a DNA-binding domain.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "2719-25", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2824190}, "PUB00005459" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Aasland R" "Stewart AF" "Gibson T."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
