{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the DedA family of proteins which includes the inner membrane proteins YghB, YqjA, and DedA. DedA may be involved in undecaprenyl phosphate (UndP) transport and recycling [[cite:PUB00153389]]. YghB may be a membrane transporter required for proton motive force (PMF)-dependent drug efflux. It required, with YqjA, for the proper export of certain periplasmic amidases and, possibly, other Tat substrates. It may play a role in determining membrane lipid composition [[cite:PUB00151908]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30353" "INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN DEDA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DedA-like", "short" "DedA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4926, "taxa" 20966, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38141, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38141, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29296}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032818", :literature {"PUB00153389" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7945", "authors" ["Roney IJ" "Rudner DZ."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05587-z", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Two broadly conserved families of polyprenyl-phosphate transporters.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "729-734", "volume" "613", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36450357}, "PUB00151908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kumar S" "Doerrler WT."], "ISO_journal" "Antimicrob Agents Chemother", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.02238-13", "medline_journal" "Antimicrob Agents Chemother", "title" "Members of the conserved DedA family are likely membrane transporters and are required for drug resistance in Escherichia coli.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "923-30", "volume" "58", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24277026}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR032818", "name" "DedA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
