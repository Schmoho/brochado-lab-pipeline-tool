{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NCU-G1 is a set of highly conserved nuclear proteins rich in proline with a molecular weight of approximately 44kDa. Especially high levels are detected in human prostate, liver and kidney. NCU-G1 is a dual-function family capable of functioning as a transcription factor as well as a nuclear receptor co-activator by stimulating the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) [[cite:PUB00070034]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nyq", "name" "Crystal structure of glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein (GLMP) luminal domain bound to a Fab fragment"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15065" "Lysosomal transcription factor, NCU-G1"}, "panther" {"PTHR31981" "GLYCOSYLATED LYSOSOMAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysosomal transcription factor, NCU-G1", "short" "NCU-G1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 775, "taxa" 3244, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1705, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1598, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1083}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029382", :literature {"PUB00070034" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Steffensen KR" "Bouzga M" "Skjeldal F" "Kasi C" "Karahasan A" "Matre V" "Bakke O" "Guerin S" "Eskild W."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Mol.
