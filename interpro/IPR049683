HVO_2753 (also known as Small CPxCG-related zinc finger protein) has four C(P)XCG motifs, two that form a zinc binding pocket and binds one zinc atom, and two that form form a four-Cys cluster that do not bind zinc, All of them are critical for protein stability, folding and functionality [[cite:PUB00096940]]. Short proteins of this family are important for stress adaptation, biofilm formation, and swarming.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041909" "HVO_2753 family zinc finger protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger protein HVO_2753-like, euryarchaeota", "short" "HVO_2753-like_euryarch"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 134, "taxa" 713, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 509, "sets" 0, "proteins" 509, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 446}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049683", :literature {"PUB00096940" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zahn S" "Kubatova N" "Pyper DJ" "Cassidy L" "Saxena K" "Tholey A" "Schwalbe H" "Soppa J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Biological functions, genetic and biochemical characterization, and NMR structure determination of the small zinc finger protein HVO_2753 from Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32905660}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044720", "name" "Zinc finger protein HVO_2753-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR049683", "name" "Zinc finger protein HVO_2753-like, euryarchaeota", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
