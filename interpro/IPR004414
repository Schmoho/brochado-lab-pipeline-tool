{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase, subunit E (GatE) is found only in the Archaea. It is part of a heterodimer, with GatD ([interpro:IPR011878]), that acts as an amidotransferase on misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln) to produce Gln-tRNA(Gln) [[cite:PUB00100077]]. The reaction takes place in the presence of glutamine and ATP through an activated gamma-phospho-Glu-tRNA(Gln). The GatDE system is specific for glutamate and does not act on aspartate. This function is carried out in bacteria by the GatABC system, which acts both on Asp-tRNA(Asn) and Glu-tRNA(Gln). GatABC orthologues also exist in some archaea, where it coexist with GatDE (GatE being paralogous to GatB); while other archaea only posses GatED and use an asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase to produce Asn-tRNA by direct acylation of the tRNA [[cite:PUB00015320]]. The crystal structure of GatED showed tRNA(Gln) recognition by indirect readout based on shape complementarity [[cite:PUB00040197]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014746", "name" "Glutamine synthetase/guanido kinase, catalytic domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00588" "Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit E [gatE]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00134" "Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit GatE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit E", "short" "GatE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 321, "taxa" 2569, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3565, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3565, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2821}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0258", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0258"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
