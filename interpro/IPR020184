{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes keratin-associated protein 7-1, a member of the type 7 family. In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulphide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulphur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other groups of keratin-associated proteins include [interpro:IPR007951] and [interpro:IPR021743].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38504" "KERATIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7-1"}, "pfam" {"PF15034" "KRTAP type 7 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Keratin-associated protein 7", "short" "KRTAP7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 101, "taxa" 383, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 85}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020184", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020184", "name" "Keratin-associated protein 7", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 98}}}
