Gp45 is a component of the baseplate that forms a central needlelike spike used to puncture the host cell membrane for tube insertion during virus entry. It serves as the distal plug of tail tube channel and might regulate the process of the phage DNA and protein ejection into the host cell [[cite:PUB00077063], [cite:PUB00065189]].
