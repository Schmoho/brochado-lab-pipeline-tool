{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Transmembrane protein 106A/B/C, type II transmembrane proteins which have homology to the late embryogenesis abundant-2 (LEA-2) domain [[cite:PUB00100166]]. TMEM106A has been identified as a key factor to regulate macrophage activation and a tumour suppressor in gastric, renal cancer and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), being an interesting therapeutic target for the management of NSCLC [[cite:PUB00100168], [cite:PUB00100167]]. TMEM106B localises to late endosomes and lysosomes, and it is involved in dendrite morphogenesis and maintenance by regulating lysosomal trafficking via its interaction with MAP6 [[cite:PUB00070924]]. Its overexpression is associated with familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration [[cite:PUB00100169]]. It has also been identified as a protein required for productive SARS-CoV-2 infection [[cite:PUB00100166]]. Structural analysis of LEA-2 domains revealed that they have a long, conserved lipid-binding groove, implying that TMEM106B and its homologues, Vac7 and Tag1 from yeast, may all be lipid transfer proteins in the lumen of late endocytic organelles.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28556" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 106B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane protein 106", "short" "TMEM106"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 818, "taxa" 2879, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3066, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3066, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2104}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009790", :literature {"PUB00100167" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Wu C" "Xu J" "Wang H" "Zhang J" "Zhong J" "Zou X" "Chen Y" "Yang G" "Zhong Y" "Lai D" "Li X" "Tang A."], "ISO_journal" "Kidney Blood Press Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Kidney Blood Press Res", "title" "TMEM106a is a Novel Tumor Suppressor in Human Renal Cancer.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "853-864", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29131025}, "PUB00100168" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Liu J" "Zhu H."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biochem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biochem", "title" "TMEM106A inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30456879}, "PUB00100166" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Levine TP."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "TMEM106B in humans and Vac7 and Tag1 in yeast are predicted to be lipid transfer proteins.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "164-175", "volume" "90", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34347309}, "PUB00100169" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Brady OA" "Zheng Y" "Murphy K" "Huang M" "Hu F."], "ISO_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Hum Mol Genet", "title" "The frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor, TMEM106B, regulates lysosomal morphology and function.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "685-95", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23136129}, "PUB00070924" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Schwenk BM" "Lang CM" "Hogl S" "Tahirovic S" "Orozco D" "Rentzsch K" "Lichtenthaler SF" "Hoogenraad CC" "Capell A" "Haass C" "Edbauer D."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/embj.201385857", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The FTLD risk factor TMEM106B and MAP6 control dendritic trafficking of lysosomes.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "450-67", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24357581}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009790", "name" "Transmembrane protein 106", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
