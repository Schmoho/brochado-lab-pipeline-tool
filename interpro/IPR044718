{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HOS1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a common regulator in the signalling pathways that control flowering time [[cite:PUB00096931], [cite:PUB00096933]]. It mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor ICE1 under cold treatment [[cite:PUB00096930]]. In Arabidopsis, CONSTANS (CO) activates transcription of the floral integrators, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) genes, which in turn govern the flowering time [[cite:PUB00096934]]. Together with Nup96, HOS1 regulates CO protein turnover and thereby prevents precocious flowering in long-day conditions [[cite:PUB00096933]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47358" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE HOS1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HOS1", "short" "HOS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 276, "taxa" 1072, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 834, "sets" 0, "proteins" 834, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 508}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
