{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the transcriptional corepressor LEUNIG homologue (LUH) from Arabidopsis. LEUNIG (LUG) and LUH are similar to the animal and fungal Gro/Tup1-type corepressors [[cite:PUB00096923]]. LUH has been shown to activate MYC2-directed transcription of JAZ2 and LOX2 via the Mediator complex coactivator and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1 [[cite:PUB00096922]]. LUH contains the N-terminal LUFS domain, which is essential for the direct interaction with its cofactor SEUSS [[cite:PUB00069759]]. LUH and LUG exhibit both redundant and divergent functions in embryonic development, floral homeotic gene regulation, and plant biotic and abiotic stress responses [[cite:PUB00096923]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised sequences from fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44376" "TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATOR OF FILAMENTOUS GROWTH FLO8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional corepressor LEUNIG-like", "short" "LEUNIG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 415, "taxa" 1568, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2693, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2693, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1597}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044716", :literature {"PUB00096922" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["You Y" "Zhai Q" "An C" "Li C."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "LEUNIG_HOMOLOG Mediates MYC2-Dependent Transcriptional Activation in Cooperation with the Coactivators HAC1 and MED25.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "2187-2205", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31320481}, "PUB00096923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sitaraman J" "Bui M" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "LEUNIG_HOMOLOG and LEUNIG perform partially redundant functions during Arabidopsis embryo and floral development.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "672-81", "volume" "147", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18390806}, "PUB00069759" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Sridhar VV" "Surendrarao A" "Gonzalez D" "Conlan RS" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
