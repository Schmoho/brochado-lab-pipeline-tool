{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Myotubularin-related protein 14 (MTMR14, also known as Jumpy) belongs to the myotubularin family, whose members are dual-specificity phosphatases that act primarily to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides (PIs). They act specifically on PI3P and PI3,5P2, dephosphorylating them to form PIP and PI5P, respectively [[cite:PUB00043723]]. MTMR14 interacts with early autophagosomes and negatively regulates progression through the steps of autophagy [[cite:PUB00090121]]. It has been linked to the a congenital muscle disorder known as myopathy, centronuclear, 1 (CNM1) [[cite:PUB00090122]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029021", "name" "Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13524" "MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myotubularin-related protein 14", "short" "MTMR14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 856, "taxa" 3429, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2385, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1456}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
