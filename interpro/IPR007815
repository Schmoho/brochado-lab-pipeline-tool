{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains erythromycin esterase, which shares conserved active site residues of the Tiki/TraB family. Erythromycin esterases (EreA and EreB) disrupt erythromycin via the hydrolysis of the macrolactone ring. A critical catalytic histidine acts as a general base in the activation of a water molecule. Macrolides act by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding at the exit tunnel of ribosomal subunit 50s, blocking the translation of the polypeptide. Erythromycin esterase, typically found in integrons and transposons, confers antibiotic resistance through the disruption of the drug ring structure. EreB substrate profile is substantially broader than that for EreA, being able to also metabolize semisynthetic derivatives such as azalide azithromycin [[cite:PUB00096159], [cite:PUB00010534], [cite:PUB00096158], [cite:PUB00010533], [cite:PUB00040938]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6xcq", "name" "Erythromycin esterase EreC, mutant H289N in its closed conformation"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14728" "Erythromycin esterase and succinoglycan biosynthesis related proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF05139" "Erythromycin esterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Erythromycin esterase", "short" "Emycin_Estase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 57, "proteomes" 2417, "taxa" 8903, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10277, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10249, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7889}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
