{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases that act on ornithine-, lysine-, arginine- and related substrates can be classified into different families on the basis of sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00003632], [cite:PUB00001452]]. One of these families includes eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which catalyses the transformation of ornithine into putrescine; prokaryotic diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase (DAPDC), which catalyses the conversion of diaminopimelic acid into lysine, the final step of lysine biosynthesis; Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci protein, tabA, which is probably involved in tabtoxin biosynthesis and is similar to DAPDC; and bacterial and plant biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase (ADC), which catalyses the transformation of arginine into agmatine, the first step in putrescine synthesis from arginine. <p>Although these proteins, which are known collectively as group IV decarboxylases [[cite:PUB00001452]], probably share a common evolutionary origin, their levels of sequence similarity are low, being confined to a few short conserved regions. The tomato ADC gene contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 502 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of ~55kDa [[cite:PUB00006119]]. The predicted amino acid sequence shares 47 and 38% identify with oat and Escherichia coli ADCs, respectively. Gel blot hybridisation experiments show that, in tomato, ADC is encoded by a single gene and is expressed as a transcript of ~2.2 kb in the fruit pericarp and leaf tissues [[cite:PUB00006119]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009006", "name" "Alanine racemase/group IV decarboxylase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06830" "Type III Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-Dependent Enzyme Arginine Decarboxylase"}, "panther" {"PTHR43295" "ARGININE DECARBOXYLASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01417" "Biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase [speA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01273" "arginine decarboxylase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001336" "Arginine decarboxylase"}, "prints" {"PR01180" "ARGDCRBXLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arginine decarboxylase", "short" "Arg_decrbxlase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2774, "taxa" 13163, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15016, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14431, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10835}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1253", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1253"} {"accession" "GenProp0642", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0642"} {"accession" "GenProp1431", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1431"} {"accession" "GenProp1733", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1733"} {"accession" "GenProp1282", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1282"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
