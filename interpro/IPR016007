{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of alpha-L-rhamnosidase enzymes which are primarily involved in the degradation of complex polysaccharides. L-Rhamnose is abundant in biomass as a common constituent of glycolipids and glycosides, such as plant pigments, pectic polysaccharides, gums or biosurfactants. Some rhamnosides are important bioactive compounds. For example, terpenyl glycosides, the glycosidic precursor of aromatic terpenoids, act as important flavouring substances in grapes. Other rhamnosides act as cytotoxic rhamnosylated terpenoids, as signal substances in plants or play a role in the antigenicity of pathogenic bacteria [[cite:PUB00011520]]. Some members of this family are also capable of releasing L-rhamnose from a variety of plant-derived compounds, including citrus flavonoids and arabinogalactan-proteins. The presence of a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM67) in some family members suggests a specialized domain for L-rhamnose recognition, which is calcium-dependent for its ligand binding.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the Bifunctional sulfatase/alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Formosa agariphila, which is involved in ulvan degradation [[cite:PUB00093668]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6gsz", "name" "Crystal structure of native alfa-L-rhamnosidase from Aspergillus terreus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33307" "ALPHA-RHAMNOSIDASE (EUROFUNG)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF010631" "Alpha-L-rhamnosidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-L-rhamnosidase", "short" "Alpha_rhamnosid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2234, "taxa" 8206, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19250, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18750, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13312}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
