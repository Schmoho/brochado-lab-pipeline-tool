{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a structurally complex cofactor, consisting of a modified tetrapyrrole with a centrally chelated cobalt. Cobalamin is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: methylcobalamin and adocobalamin. Most prokaryotes, as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes, whereas plants and fungi do not appear to use it. In bacteria and archaea, these include methionine synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, glutamate and methylmalonyl-CoA mutases, ethanolamine ammonia lyase, and diol dehydratase [[cite:PUB00015657]]. In mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [[cite:PUB00035308]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The CbiT subunit of precorrin-6Y C5,15-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.132]) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyses two methylations (at C-5 and C-15) in precorrin-6Y, as well as the decarboxylation of the acetate side chain located in ring C, in order to generate precorrin-8X. In the anaerobic pathway, two enzymes are required to produce precorrin-8X: CbiE and CbiT, which can be fused as CbiET (sometimes called CobL) [[cite:PUB00014680]]. In the aerobic pathway, the enzyme is a fusion of CbiE and CbiT which is refered to as CobL [[cite:PUB00014681]].
