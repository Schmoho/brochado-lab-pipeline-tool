{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the tryptophan operon leader peptides, which are important for the control of tryptophan biosynthesis. The tryptophan operon is regulated by transcription attenuation in response to changes in the level of tryptophan. The transcript of the leader peptide can adopt alternative mutually-exclusive secondary structures that would either result in termination of transcription of the tryptophan structural genes or in transcription of the entire operon [[cite:PUB00016573]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08056" "Tryptophan operon leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tryptophan operon leader peptide", "short" "Trp_leader2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 140, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 133, "sets" 0, "proteins" 133, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 95}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012639", :literature {"PUB00016573" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Gollnick P" "Babitzke P."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
