They mediate the active uptake of hexoses such as glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, fructose, xylose, mannose, galactose, fucose, 2-deoxyglucose and arabinose, by sugar/hydrogen symport. Several STP family transporters are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, or at specific developmental stages. STP1 is the member with the highest expression level of all members and high expression is detected in photosynthetic tissues, such as leaves and stems, while roots, siliques, and flowers show lower expression levels. It plays a major role in the uptake and response of Arabidopsis seeds and seedlings to sugars [[cite:PUB00097067], [cite:PUB00097069]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The plant Polyol transporter (PLT) subfamily includes PLT1-6 from Arabidopsis thaliana and similar transporters [[cite:PUB00097060]]. The best characterised member of the group is Polyol transporter 5, also called Sugar-proton symporter PLT5, which mediates the H-symport of numerous substrates including linear polyols (such as sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol or glycerol), cyclic polyol myo-inositol, and different hexoses, pentoses (including ribose), tetroses, and sugar alcohols. It functions to transport a wide range of substrates into specific sink tissues in the plant [[cite:PUB00097059], [cite:PUB00097057]]. The PLT subfamily belongs to the Glucose transporter-like (GLUT-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement [[cite:PUB00097058]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked"
