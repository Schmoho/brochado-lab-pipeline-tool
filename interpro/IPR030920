{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Spore formation by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a stress response triggered by nutrient limitation. Two operons are strongly induced at the start of sporulation; one of them is skf (for sporulation killing factor). skf produces a killing factor which, together with a signaling protein, act cooperatively to block sister cells from sporulating and cause them to lyse, providing a source of nutrients to support the sporulation process [[cite:PUB00055033]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The skf operon consists of skfA-H. SkfA induces the lysis of sibling cells that have not entered the sporulation pathway [[cite:PUB00074206]]. SkfF has multiple membrane-spanning domains and is encoded next to SkfE, a protein with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) homology, suggesting ABC transporter permease activity for this protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04405" "sporulation killing factor system integral membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation killing factor system integral membrane protein SkfF", "short" "SkfF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1078", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1078"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030920", :literature {"PUB00055033" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5632", "authors" ["Gonzalez-Pastor JE" "Hobbs EC" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1086462", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Cannibalism by sporulating bacteria.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "510-3", "volume" "301", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12817086}, "PUB00074206" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Allenby NE" "Watts CA" "Homuth G" "Pragai Z" "Wipat A" "Ward AC" "Harwood CR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
