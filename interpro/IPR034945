{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CarBa is the A subunit of 2-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidization and subsequent ring-opening of 2-aminophenyl-2,3-diol. It is a key enzyme in the carbazole degradation pathway isolated from bacterial strains with carbazole degradation ability. The enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two A and two B subunits. CarB belongs to the class III extradiol dioxygenase family, composed of enzymes which use a non-heme Fe(II) to cleave aromatic rings between a hydroxylated carbon and an adjacent non-hydroxylated carbon. Although the enzyme was originally isolated as a meta-cleavage enzyme for 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol involved in carbazole degradation, the enzyme has also shown high specificity for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl [[cite:PUB00015248]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036622", "name" "Dioxygenase LigAB, LigA subunit superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07922" "CarBa is the A subunit of 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidization and subsequent ring-opening of 2-aminophenyl-2,3-diol"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase, A subunit", "short" "CarBa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 57, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034945", :literature {"PUB00015248" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Iwata K" "Nojiri H" "Shimizu K" "Yoshida T" "Habe H" "Omori T."], "ISO_journal" "Biosci.
