{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This prokaryotic integral membrane protein family includes Brp (bacterio-opsin related protein) and Blh (Brp-like protein). Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump consisting of the membrane apoprotein bacterioopsin and a covalently bound retinal cofactor that appears to be derived of beta-carotene. Blh has been shown to cleave beta-carotene [[cite:PUB00060543]] to produce two all-trans retinal molecules. It has been suggested that Brp and Blh are similar proteins that catalyze or regulate the conversion of beta-carotene to retinal [[cite:PUB00060541]]. Mammalian enzymes with similar enzymatic function are not multiple membrane spanning proteins and are not homologous.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03753" "beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, Brp/Blh family"}, "pfam" {"PF15461" "Beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase"}, "hamap" {"MF_02093" "Probable beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, Brp/Blh family", "short" "Blh_diox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 426, "taxa" 2425, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2487, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2482, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1886}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
