{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is a small group of metazoan sequences with sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) and rice. The sequences represent pyrimidine 5-nucleotidases, apparently in reference to HSPC233, the Homo sapiens (Human) homologue [[cite:PUB00055591]].  The structure of mouse sequence has been reported [[cite:PUB00039616]].  This group of sequences was originally found during searches for members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. All of the conserved catalytic motifs [[cite:PUB00003337]] are found. The placement of the variable domain between motifs 1 and 2 indicates membership in subfamily I of the superfamily, but these sequences are sufficiently different from any of the branches of that subfamily (IA-ID) as to constitute a separate branch to now be called IE. Considering that the closest identifiable hit outside of the noise range is to a phosphoserine phosphatase, this group may be considered to be most closely allied to subfamily IB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7zee", "name" "Human cytosolic 5' nucleotidase IIIB"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07504" "haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like 5'-nucleotidases similar to human cytosolic IIIA and IIIB"}, "sfld" {"SFLDG01128" "C1.4: 5'-Nucleotidase Like"}, "pfam" {"PF05822" "Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (UMPH-1)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01544" "HAD-IE family hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, eukaryotic", "short" "Pyrimidine_nucleotidase_eu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 73, "proteomes" 1393, "taxa" 5584, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4906, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4785, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3162}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
