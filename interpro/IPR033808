{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>BPSL1549, also suggested to be called Burkholderia lethal factor 1, is a protein of unknown function from Burkholderia pseudomallei, a causative agent of melioidosis (also called Whitmore's disease). This protein shows similarity to Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 which has been found to act as a potent cytotoxin against eukaryotic cells and is lethal when administered to mice [[cite:PUB00081313]]. BPSL1549 expression levels correlate with suppression or promotion of pathogenic conditions. BPSL1549 inhibits helicase activity of translation initiation factor eIF4A. As yet, there is no vaccine and the organism is multidrug resistant [[cite:PUB00065664]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3tu8", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Burkholderia Lethal Factor 1 (BLF1)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17752" "Burkholderia lethal factor 1"}, "cdd" {"cd12812" "Burkholderia Lethal Factor 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Burkholderia lethal factor 1", "short" "BPSL1549"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 49, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033808", :literature {"PUB00065664" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6057", "authors" ["Cruz-Migoni A" "Hautbergue GM" "Artymiuk PJ" "Baker PJ" "Bokori-Brown M" "Chang CT" "Dickman MJ" "Essex-Lopresti A" "Harding SV" "Mahadi NM" "Marshall LE" "Mobbs GW" "Mohamed R" "Nathan S" "Ngugi SA" "Ong C" "Ooi WF" "Partridge LJ" "Phillips HL" "Raih MF" "Ruzheinikov S" "Sarkar-Tyson M" "Sedelnikova SE" "Smither SJ" "Tan P" "Titball RW" "Wilson SA" "Rice DW."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1211915", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "A Burkholderia pseudomallei toxin inhibits helicase activity of translation factor eIF4A.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "821-4", "volume" "334", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22076380}, "PUB00081313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Boquet P."], "ISO_journal" "Folia Microbiol.
