Its repression activity is mediated at least in part through direct recruitment of histone deacetylases [[cite:PUB00060186]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15741" "Ligand-dependent nuclear receptor-interacting factor 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR16131" "LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-INTERACTING FACTOR 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ligand-dependent nuclear receptor-interacting factor 1", "short" "LRIF1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 525, "taxa" 1812, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1013, "sets" 0, "proteins" 884, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 610}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026191", :literature {"PUB00060186" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Li HJ" "Haque ZK" "Chen A" "Mendelsohn M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
