{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group contains uncharacterised proteins that are implicated in nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NMN) biosynthesis based on the genomic context of the corresponding genes (operon structure, gene neighbourhood) [[cite:PUB00014453]]. The Rhizobium loti (Mesorhizobium loti) member (Msi362, ORF1) is encoded by the symbiosis island that contains operons required for the syntheses of nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NMN) and biotin, and belongs to the<i>nad</i>operon [[cite:PUB00014453], [cite:PUB00014358]]. The Neisseria meningitidis member is flanked by<i>nadA</i>and<i>nadC</i>genes whose products are part of the pathway for NMN synthesis in Escherichia coli. However, mutation in ORF1 failed to produce the vitamin auxotrophic phenotype [[cite:PUB00014453]], which suggests that members of this group may have a non-essential role in this process.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF019423" "Predicted nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NMN) biosynthesis protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nicotinic acid mononucleotide biosynthesis protein", "short" "NMN_biosyn"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 699, "taxa" 2973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3140, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2809, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2263}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011213", :literature {"PUB00014453" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Sullivan JT" "Brown SD" "Yocum RR" "Ronson CW."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/147/5/1315", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "The bio operon on the acquired symbiosis island of Mesorhizobium sp. strain R7A includes a novel gene involved in pimeloyl-CoA synthesis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1315-22", "volume" "147", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11320134}, "PUB00014358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Sullivan JT" "Trzebiatowski JR" "Cruickshank RW" "Gouzy J" "Brown SD" "Elliot RM" "Fleetwood DJ" "McCallum NG" "Rossbach U" "Stuart GS" "Weaver JE" "Webby RJ" "De Bruijn FJ" "Ronson CW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
