{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Shikimate kinase ([ec:2.7.1.71]) catalyses the fifth step in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids from chorismate (the so-called shikimate pathway) [[cite:PUB00001125]]. The enzyme catalyses the following reaction:</p>\n\n<p>\n<reaction>\nATP + shikimate = ADP + shikimate-3-phosphate\n</reaction>\n</p>\n\n<p>The protein is found in bacteria (gene aroK or aroL), plants and fungi (where it is part of a multifunctional enzyme that catalyses five consecutive steps in this pathway). In 1994, the 3D structure of shikimate kinase was predicted to be very close to that of adenylate kinase, suggesting a functional similarity as well as an evolutionary relationship [[cite:PUB00005018]]. This prediction has since been confirmed experimentally. The protein is reported to possess an α/β fold, consisting of a central sheet of five parallel β-strands flanked by α-helices. Such a topology is very similar to that of adenylate kinase [[cite:PUB00003386]].</p>\n\n<p>The N terminus of threonine synthase-like 1 from metazoan shares protein sequence similarity with shikimate kinase and is included in this entry. However, their functions may be different.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1e6c", "name" "K15M MUTANT OF SHIKIMATE KINASE FROM ERWINIA CHRYSANTHEMI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00464" "SK"}, "hamap" {"MF_00109" "Shikimate kinase [aroK]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shikimate kinase/Threonine synthase-like 1", "short" "Shikimate_kinase/TSH1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 44, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10922, "taxa" 40149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48307, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48307, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35446}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00868", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00868"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
