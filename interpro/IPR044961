{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, including POLLENLESS 3 (also known as MS5) and SULFUR DEFICIENCY-INDUCED 1 (SDI1). MS5 is involved in the regulation of cell division after male meiosis I and II to facilitate exit from meiosis and transition to G1. MS5 mutants are male sterile, pollen tetrads undergo an extra round of division after meiosis II without chromosome replication, resulting in chromosome abnormalities [[cite:PUB00097624], [[cite:PUB00097625]]. SDI1 is involved in the utilization of stored sulphate pools under sulphur-limiting conditions [[cite:PUB00097626]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36326" "PROTEIN POLLENLESS 3-LIKE 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetratricopeptide repeat protein POLLENLESS 3/SULFUR DEFICIENCY-INDUCED 1", "short" "MS5/SDI1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1066, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2322, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2322, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1371}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044961", :literature {"PUB00097624" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Ross KJ" "Fransz P" "Armstrong SJ" "Vizir I" "Mulligan B" "Franklin FC" "Jones GH."], "ISO_journal" "Chromosome Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Chromosome Res", "title" "Cytological characterization of four meiotic mutants of Arabidopsis isolated from T-DNA-transformed lines.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "551-9", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9451956}, "PUB00097625" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Bulankova P" "Riehs-Kearnan N" "Nowack MK" "Schnittger A" "Riha K."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Meiotic progression in Arabidopsis is governed by complex regulatory interactions between SMG7, TDM1, and the meiosis I-specific cyclin TAM.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "3791-803", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21119056}, "PUB00097626" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Howarth JR" "Parmar S" "Barraclough PB" "Hawkesford MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Biotechnol J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Biotechnol J", "title" "A sulphur deficiency-induced gene, sdi1, involved in the utilization of stored sulphate pools under sulphur-limiting conditions has potential as a diagnostic indicator of sulphur nutritional status.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "200-9", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19154231}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044961", "name" "Tetratricopeptide repeat protein POLLENLESS 3/SULFUR DEFICIENCY-INDUCED 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
