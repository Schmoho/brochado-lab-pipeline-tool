{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of eukaryotic proteins that function as exonucleases, including RNA exonuclease 1 homologue from humans (REXO1), RNA exonuclease 3 from Candida albicans, RNA exonuclease 4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (REXO4), and Putative small RNA degrading nuclease 1-5 from Arabidopsis thaliana (SDN1-5), all of which appear to have exonuclease activity [[cite:PUB00101628], [cite:PUB00084623]]. Interferon-stimulated gene 20 kDa proteins from mammals (also known as apoptosis-enhancing nuclease AEN) also included in this family, which are exonucleases with activity against single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA and mediates p53-induced apoptosis [[cite:PUB00101772]]. They act also as interferon-induced antiviral exoribonucleases [[cite:PUB00101627]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wlj", "name" "human ISG20"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12801" "RNA EXONUCLEASE REXO1 / RECO3 FAMILY MEMBER-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA exonuclease REXO1/REXO3/REXO4-like", "short" "REXO1/3/4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2709, "taxa" 9236, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18737, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18737, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11967}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
