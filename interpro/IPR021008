{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of DltX proteins of approximately 50 amino acids in length predominantly found in bacillota, including [swissprot:W8YVX8] from Bacillus thuringiensis. Members of this group are small, single-pass transmembrane proteins required for the D-alanylation of teichoic acids. DltX binds to the MBOAT protein DltB ([interpro:IPR024024]) and the SGNH hydrolase-like protein DltD ([interpro:IPR023896]) [[cite:PUB00153779], [cite:PUB00153778]]. This family was previously known as DUF3687.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12459" "D-Ala-teichoic acid biosynthesis protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-Ala-teichoic acid biosynthesis protein DltX", "short" "DltX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 175, "taxa" 1270, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1200, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1200, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 881}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021008", :literature {"PUB00153779" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Schultz BJ" "Snow ED" "Walker S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01411-0", "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "Mechanism of D-alanine transfer to teichoic acids shows how bacteria acylate cell envelope polymers.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "1318-1329", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37308592}, "PUB00153778" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kamar R" "Rejasse A" "Jehanno I" "Attieh Z" "Courtin P" "Chapot-Chartier MP" "Nielsen-Leroux C" "Lereclus D" "El Chamy L" "Kallassy M" "Sanchis-Borja V."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01437", "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "DltX of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> Is Essential for D-Alanylation of Teichoic Acids and Resistance to Antimicrobial Response in Insects.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1437", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28824570}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021008", "name" "D-Ala-teichoic acid biosynthesis protein DltX", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 18, "alignment:full" 169}}}
