{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Drosophila QUIVER protein (qvr), also known as SLEEPLESS protein or SSS, is a small (~15kDa) glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein from the Ly-6 family required for homoeostatic regulation of sleep under normal conditions and following sleep deprivation [[cite:PUB00075809]]. SSS is a novel potassium channel subunit that regulates the voltage-gated potassium channel Shaker (Sh) protein, a potassium channel which regulates the sleep [[cite:PUB00075810], [cite:PUB00075812]]. This interaction suppresses neuronal excitability and enables sleep [[cite:PUB00075812], [cite:PUB00075810]]. Besides the Sh modulation, SSS also antagonises nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to reduce synaptic transmission and promote sleep [[cite:PUB00075811]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes paralogues of qvr called UPAR/Ly6 domain-containing proteins such as crim, rtv and bero from Drosophila melanogaster and the uncharacterized protein F46C5.4 from C.elegans.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17064" "Quiver family u-PAR/Ly-6-like domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UPAR/Ly6 domain-containing protein Quiver-like", "short" "QVR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 95, "proteomes" 351, "taxa" 1895, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6503, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6448, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4085}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031424", :literature {"PUB00075809" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5887", "authors" ["Koh K" "Joiner WJ" "Wu MN" "Yue Z" "Smith CJ" "Sehgal A."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1155942", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Identification of SLEEPLESS, a sleep-promoting factor.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "372-6", "volume" "321", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18635795}, "PUB00075810" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Dean T" "Xu R" "Joiner W" "Sehgal A" "Hoshi T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
