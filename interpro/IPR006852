{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The entry represents a group of proteins mainly found in plants, including MUCI70 and TOD1 from Arabidopsis. They share a Rossmann-like fold found in glycosyltransferases.</p>\n\n<p>MUCI70 is a predicted glycosyltransferase essential for the accumulation of seed mucilage, a gelatinous wall rich in unbranched rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I), and for shaping the surface morphology of seeds [[cite:PUB00095110], [cite:PUB00101913]]. Together with IRX14, itis required for xylan and pectin synthesis in seed coat epidermal (SCE) cells.</p>\n\n<p>TOD1 is an endoplasmic reticulum ceramidase that catalyses the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids at alkaline pH (e.g. pH 9.5) [[cite:PUB00101912]]. It is involved in the regulation of turgor pressure in guard cells and pollen tubes [[cite:PUB00101912], [cite:PUB00101914]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12956" "ALKALINE CERAMIDASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alkaline ceramidase TOD1/Probable hexosyltransferase MUCI70", "short" "TOD1_MUCI70"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 339, "taxa" 1803, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5133, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5133, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3195}, "pathways" 201}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
