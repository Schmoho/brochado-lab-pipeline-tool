{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This subfamily is composed of sequences from the gammaproteobacteria that function as L-rhamnosyltransferases in the synthesis of their respective surface polysaccharides. Rhamnolipids are glycolipids containing mono- or di- L-rhamnose molecules. Rhamnolipid synthesis occurs by sequential glycosyltransferase reactions involving two distinct rhamnosyltransferase enzymes. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the synthesis of mono-rhamnolipids is catalyzed by rhamnosyltransferase 1, and proceeds by a glycosyl transfer reaction catalyzed by rhamnosyltransferase 2 to yield di-rhamnolipids [[cite:PUB00009640]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01556" "rhamnosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhamnosyltransferase", "short" "RhaTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 134, "taxa" 1008, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 750, "sets" 0, "proteins" 750, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 579}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GT2", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GT2.html"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006446", :literature {"PUB00009640" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rahim R" "Ochsner UA" "Olvera C" "Graninger M" "Messner P" "Lam JS" "Soberon-Chavez G."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
