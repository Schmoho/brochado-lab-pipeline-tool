{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry contain a fido domain.  The domain is named after the Fic and Doc proteins where it is found. Included in this entry are adenosine monophosphate-protein transferase Fic and FICD.  Both Fic and FICD add adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) to specific residues of target proteins (AMPylation), or remove the same modification from target proteins (de-AMPylation), depending on whether cells are in a resting state or stressed [[cite:PUB00090695]].  Both bind divalent cations, preferring Mn<sup>2+</sup>over Mg<sup>2+</sup>[[cite:PUB00090696]].  The adenosine monophosphate-protein transferase SoFic from Shewanella oneidensis is known only to add AMP to target proteins, either at Tyr or Thr residues [[cite:PUB00057637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7b7z", "name" "DeAMPylation complex of monomeric FICD and AMPylated BiP (state 1)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036597", "name" "Fido-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13504" "FIDO DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN DDB_G0283145"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fido domain-containing protein", "short" "Fido_containing"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6244, "taxa" 31409, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 52392, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52392, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39423}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
