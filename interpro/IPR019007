{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Synonym(s): Rsp5 or WWP domain</p>\r\n<p>The WW domain is a short conserved region in a number of unrelated proteins, which folds as a stable, triple stranded Î²-sheet. This short domain of approximately 40 amino acids, may be repeated up to four times in some proteins [[cite:PUB00005431], [cite:PUB00000239], [cite:PUB00001680],\r\n[cite:PUB00001690]]. The name WW or WWP derives from the presence of two signature tryptophan residues that are spaced 20-23 amino acids apart and are present in most WW domains known to date, as well as that of a conserved Pro. The WW domain binds to proteins with particular proline-motifs, [AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y, and/or phosphoserine- phosphothreonine-containing motifs [[cite:PUB00004872], [cite:PUB00007124]]. It is frequently associated with other domains typical for proteins in signal transduction processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large variety of proteins containing the WW domain are known. These include; dystrophin, a multidomain cytoskeletal protein; utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein of unknown function; vertebrate YAP protein, substrate of an unknown serine kinase; Mus musculus (Mouse) NEDD-4, involved in the embryonic development and differentiation of the central nervous system; Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) RSP5, similar to NEDD-4 in its molecular organisation; Rattus norvegicus (Rat) FE65, a transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in liver; Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco) DB10 protein, amongst others.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents WW domain-binding protein 11, which may play a role in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing, and also EARLY FLOWERING 5, which acts as a repressor of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00090956]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09429" "WW domain binding protein 11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WW domain binding protein 11", "short" "WW_dom-bd_prot_11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 64, "proteomes" 2317, "taxa" 7865, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3732, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3721, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2403}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019007", :literature {"PUB00005431" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Bork P" "Sudol M."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
