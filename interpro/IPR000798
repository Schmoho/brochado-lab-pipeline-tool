{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ERM family consisting of three closely related proteins, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, that work as cross-linkers between plasma membranes and actin-based cytoskeletons as well as taking part in signal transduction.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The ERM family consists of three closely-related proteins, ezrin, radixin and moesin [[cite:PUB00005477]]. Ezrin was first identified as a constituent of microvilli [[cite:PUB00003053]], radixin as a barbed, end-capping actin-modulating protein from isolated junctional fractions [[cite:PUB00003059]], and moesin as a heparin binding protein [[cite:PUB00000467]], which is particularly important in immunity acting on both T and B-cells homeostasis and self-tolerance [[cite:PUB00098656], [cite:PUB00098657]]. Members of this family have been associated with axon-associated Schwann cell (SC) motility and the maintenance of the polarity of these cells [[cite:PUB00098658]]. A tumour suppressor molecule responsible for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is highly similar to ERM proteins and has been designated merlin (moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein) [[cite:PUB00095066]]. ERM molecules contain 3 domains, an N-terminal globular domain, an extended α-helical domain and a charged C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00005477]]. Ezrin, radixin and merlin also contain a polyproline region between the helical and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain is highly conserved, and is also found in merlin, band 4.1 proteins and members of the band 4.1 superfamily, designated the FERM domain [[cite:PUB00095065]]. ERM proteins crosslink actin filaments with plasma membranes. They co-localise with CD44 at actin filament plasma membrane interaction sites, associating with CD44 via their N-terminal domains and with actin filaments via their C-terminal domains [[cite:PUB00005477]]. The α-helical region is involved in intramolecular masking of protein-protein interaction sites which regulates the activity of this proteins [[cite:PUB00041575]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029071", "name" "Ubiquitin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011993", "name" "PH-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR014352", "name" "FERM/acyl-CoA-binding protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR035963", "name" "FERM superfamily, second domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00661" "ERMFAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ezrin/radixin/moesin-like", "short" "Ez/rad/moesin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 100, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1028, "taxa" 4248, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 148869, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31078, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17469}, "pathways" 49}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
