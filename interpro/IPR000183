{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases acting on ornithine, lysine, arginine and related substrates can be classified into two different families on the basis of sequence similarities [[cite:PUB00003632], [cite:PUB00001452]]. Members of this family while most probably evolutionary related, do not share extensive regions of sequence similarities. PLP-dependent decarboxylases exhibit two different structural folds, Fold I and Fold III. This family belong to the Fold III group which proceed with retention of configuration at the site of decarboxylation, with the exception of diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) and D-ornithine/D-lysine decarboxylase (DOKDC) from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, that are known as stereoinverting decarboxylases [[cite:PUB00095574]]. The proteins contain a conserved lysine residue which is known, in mouse ODC [[cite:PUB00002726]], to be the site of attachment of the pyridoxal-phosphate group and it is thought to be responsible for protonation of the product, thus resulting in the retention of configuration for decarboxylation of l-amino acids and inversion for decarboxylation of d-amino acids [[cite:PUB00095574]]. The proteins also contain a stretch of three consecutive glycine residues and has been proposed to be part of a substrate-binding region [[cite:PUB00002116]].</p>\n\n<p>These enzymes are collectively known as group IV decarboxylases, and include ornithine and arginine decarboxylases, and diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAP) [[cite:PUB00001452]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029066", "name" "PLP-binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009006", "name" "Alanine racemase/group IV decarboxylase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01179" "ODADCRBXLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ornithine/DAP/Arg decarboxylase", "short" "Orn/DAP/Arg_de-COase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 59, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11527, "taxa" 43883, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 372215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 81249, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 60893}, "pathways" 80}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00685", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00685"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
