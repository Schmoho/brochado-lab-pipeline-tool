{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>While most bacteria synthesise lysine via diaminopimelate, a few species, such as Thermus thermophilus, and some hyperthermophilic archaea, synthesise this amino acid from alpha-aminoadipate (AAA). LysW plays an essential role in this pathway by preventing unstable intermediates from undergoing intramolecular cyclisation [[cite:PUB00053254]]. This is accomplished by covalent binding of the reactive amino group of AAA to a glutamate residue in LysW. The covalently attached AAA is subsequently converted to lysine and then released from LysW by the action of other proteins in this pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3wwl", "name" "Crystal structure of lysine biosynthetic amino acid carrier protein LysW from Thermus thermophilus conjugated with alpha-aminoadipate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21344" "Alpha-aminoadipate carrier protein LysW-like, globular domain"}, "cdd" {"cd13946" "Lysine biosynthesis protein LysW"}, "panther" {"PTHR40393" "LYSINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN-RELATED-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01206" "lysine biosynthesis protein LysW"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysine biosynthesis protein LysW", "short" "LysW"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 458, "taxa" 2769, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3206, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3201, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2515}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005906", :literature {"PUB00053254" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Horie A" "Tomita T" "Saiki A" "Kono H" "Taka H" "Mineki R" "Fujimura T" "Nishiyama C" "Kuzuyama T" "Nishiyama M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
