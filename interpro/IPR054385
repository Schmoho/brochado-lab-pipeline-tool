{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Anti-restriction endonuclease from Enterobacteria phage T4 () proteins and similar sequences from tailed bacteriophages. Arn plays a role in the inhibition of the host restriction-modification system. Arn was identified as an inhibitor of the restriction enzyme McrBC. Its structure consists of a three-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet on one side, while on the other side, four α-helices are bundled together. A structural analysis of Arn revealed that its shape and negative charge distribution are similar to dsDNA, suggesting that this protein could act as a DNA mimic [[cite:PUB00153909]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3wx4", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE of T4 PHAGE ARN PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053757", "name" "Anti-restriction Endonuclease Superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22134" "DNA Mimic Protein Arn"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-restriction endonuclease", "short" "Arn"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 333, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 233, "sets" 0, "proteins" 233, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054385", :literature {"PUB00153909" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Ho CH" "Wang HC" "Ko TP" "Chang YC" "Wang AH."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M114.590851", "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The T4 phage DNA mimic protein Arn inhibits the DNA binding activity of the bacterial histone-like protein H-NS.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "27046-27054", "volume" "289", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25118281}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054385", "name" "Anti-restriction endonuclease", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 10}}}
