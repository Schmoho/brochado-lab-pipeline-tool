{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents cyclopropane mycolic acid synthases (CMAS) and similar sequences from actinobacteria, including tailoring enzymes that make site-specific modifications to mycolic acid precursor molecules. These include Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzymes MmaA1-MmaA4, CmaA1-CmaA2, and PcaA. The family also includes S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase UmaA, reported to be the lone member of this family not involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis. No members of this family are found in species that lack mycolic acids. This protein family excludes two more distantly related paralogs, UfaA1 and Rv3720, that are also encoded in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genome [[cite:PUB00105884]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1l1e", "name" "Crystal Structure of Mycolic Acid Cyclopropane Synthase PcaA Complexed with S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040660" "cyclopropane mycolic acid synthase family methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclopropane mycolic acid synthase, actinobacteria", "short" "CMAS_actinobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 530, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2729, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2294}, "pathways" 146}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
