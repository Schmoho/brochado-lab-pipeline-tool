{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcription factors containing basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domains interact to regulate differentiation in a number of cellular systems, including myogenesis, neurogenesis and haematopoiesis [[cite:PUB00004457]]. The DNA-binding activity of these proteins is mediated via the basic region of the bHLH domain, and is dependent upon formation of homo- and/or heterodimers by these transcription factors.</p>\n\n<p>The Id family of proteins (whose members include Id1, Id2, Id3 and the Drosophila homologue emc) contain a HLH-dimerisation domain but lack the DNA-binding basic region. Formation of heterodimers between these proteins and bHLH domain-containing transcription factors abolishes the DNA-binding ability of the latter, thus inhibiting their activity [[cite:PUB00060027]].</p>\n\n<p>Id proteins can inhibit the differentiation of progenitors of different cell types, promoting cell-cycle progression, delaying cellular senescence, and facilitating cell migration. These properties enable them to play important roles in stem cell maintenance, vasculogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis, the development of the immune system, and energy metabolism [[cite:PUB00101501]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6u2u", "name" "Helix-Loop-helix motif of mouse DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036638", "name" "Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11723" "DNA-BINDING PROTEIN INHIBITOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding protein inhibitor", "short" "DNA-bd_prot-inh"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 869, "taxa" 3605, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3371, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2342}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026052", :literature {"PUB00101501" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ling F" "Kang B" "Sun XH."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Top Dev Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Top Dev Biol", "title" "Id proteins: small molecules, mighty regulators.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "189-216", "volume" "110", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25248477}, "PUB00004457" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Riechmann V" "van Cruchten I" "Sablitzky F."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/22.5.749", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The expression pattern of Id4, a novel dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein, is distinct from Id1, Id2 and Id3.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "749-55", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8139914}, "PUB00060027" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Ding B" "Liu CJ" "Huang Y" "Yu J" "Kong W" "Lengyel P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
