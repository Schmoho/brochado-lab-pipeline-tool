These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([ec:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [[cite:PUB00009409]]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5a07", "name" "X-ray structure of the mannosyltransferase Ktr4p from S. cerevisiae in complex with GDP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31121" "ALPHA-1,2 MANNOSYLTRANSFERASE KTR1"}, "pfam" {"PF01793" "Glycolipid 2-alpha-mannosyltransferase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018153" "Glycolipid 2-alpha-mannosyltransferase, fungal type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyl transferase, family 15", "short" "Glyco_trans_15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 166, "proteomes" 1275, "taxa" 3809, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8623, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8351, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5135}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GT15", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GT15.html"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
