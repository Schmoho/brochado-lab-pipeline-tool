{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this entry are represented by the Escherichia coli (strain K12) protein FtsB. FtsB is one of the three membrane proteins required for cell division in E. coli:  FtsQ, FtsL and FtsB, all of these localize to the cell septum. FtsL and FtsB contain a leucine zipper-like sequence and are dependent on each other for their localization to the septum and each of them is dependent on FtsQ.  FtsQ is found at the cell division site in the absence of FtsL and FtsB and requires FtsK for its localization [[cite:PUB00053999]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37485" "CELL DIVISION PROTEIN FTSB"}, "hamap" {"MF_00599" "Cell division protein FtsB [ftsB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein FtsB", "short" "Cell_div_FtsB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2049, "taxa" 10071, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11104, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11104, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8623}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1142", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1142"} {"accession" "GenProp1154", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1154"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023081", :literature {"PUB00053999" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Buddelmeijer N" "Beckwith J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
