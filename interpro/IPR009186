{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The large subunit of [NiFe]-hydrogenase--as well as other nickel metalloenzymes--is synthesized as a precursor devoid of the metalloenzyme active site. This precursor then undergoes a complex post-translational maturation process that requires a number of accessory proteins [[cite:PUB00013568], [cite:PUB00013569]].</p>\r\n<p>One such group of accessory proteins is represented by [interpro:IPR011854], whose members are from archaea and are required for hydrogenase maturation [[cite:PUB00013571], [cite:PUB00013572]] (though their exact function is still unknown). Proteins from this family have similar sequences to [interpro:IPR011854] members. Thus, members of this family are predicted to play a role in maturation of some nickel metalloenzyme(s). However, other functions can not be ruled out. Both this family and [interpro:IPR011854] are related to proteins that use both purine derivatives and ATP as substrates. They belong to a superfamily of AIR synthase-related proteins that also includes PurM phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (AIR synthase), thiamine monophosphate kinase ([interpro:IPR006283]), phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (FGAM synthase, [pirsf:PIRSF001587]), and selenophosphate synthase (selenide, water dikinase).  They all contain two conserved domains and seem to dimerize. The N-terminal domain forms the dimer interface and is a putative ATP binding domain [[cite:PUB00047041]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02691" "PurM-like2"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006346" "Predicted nickel metalloenzyme maturation factor, AIR synthase-related"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Predicted nickel metalloenzyme maturation factor, AIR synthase-related", "short" "Ni_metllenz_mat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 83, "taxa" 625, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 549, "sets" 0, "proteins" 549, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 473}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009186", :literature {"PUB00047041" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kappock TJ" "Ealick SE" "Stubbe J."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1367-5931(00)00133-2", "medline_journal" "Curr Opin Chem Biol", "title" "Modular evolution of the purine biosynthetic pathway.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "567-72", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11006546}, "PUB00013571" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Jacobi A" "Rossmann R" "Bock A."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
