{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Suppressor of white apricot, also known as SWAP, is an alternative splicing regulator. SWAP was originally identified in Drosophila as a suppressor of the transposon-induced white-apricot mutation. It regulates splicing of several genes, including Swap itself [[cite:PUB00090913]]. Human SWAP has been shown to regulate alternative mRNA splicing of CD45 exon 4 and fibronectin IIICS [[cite:PUB00090912]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes CLK4-associating serine/arginine rich protein (CLASRP, also known as SWAP2).
