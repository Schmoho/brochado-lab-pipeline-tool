{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from Streptophytes, including Protein VASCULATURE COMPLEXITY AND CONNECTIVITY (also known as DEAL1), Protein DESIGUAL 2-4 (DEAL2-4) and Protein MODIFYING WALL LIGNIN-1/2 (MWL-1/2). DEAL1 is required for embryo provasculature development and cotyledon vascular complexity and connectivity [[cite:PUB00100317], [cite:PUB00100316]]. DEAL2 and 3 ensure bilateral symmetry development and early leaf margin patterning, probably via the regulation of auxin and CUC2 distribution [[cite:PUB00100316]]. MWL1 and 2 are involved in secondary cell wall biology, specifically lignin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00092870]]. Proteins included in this family contain a number of conserved cysteine residues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06749" "Protein of unknown function (DUF1218)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DESIGUAL/Modifying wall lignin-1/2", "short" "DEAL/Modifying_wall_lignin1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 70, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1111, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6957, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6873, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4176}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009606", :literature {"PUB00100317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Roschzttardtz H" "Paez-Valencia J" "Dittakavi T" "Jali S" "Reyes FC" "Baisa G" "Anne P" "Gissot L" "Palauqui JC" "Masson PH" "Bednarek SY" "Otegui MS."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "The VASCULATURE COMPLEXITY AND CONNECTIVITY gene encodes a plant-specific protein required for embryo provasculature development.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "889-902", "volume" "166", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25149602}, "PUB00100316" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wilson-Sanchez D" "Martinez-Lopez S" "Navarro-Cartagena S" "Jover-Gil S" "Micol JL."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "Members of the DEAL subfamily of the DUF1218 gene family are required for bilateral symmetry but not for dorsoventrality in Arabidopsis leaves.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1307-1321", "volume" "217", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29139551}, "PUB00092870" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Mewalal R" "Mizrachi E" "Coetzee B" "Mansfield SD" "Myburg AA."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The Arabidopsis Domain of Unknown Function 1218 (DUF1218) Containing Proteins, MODIFYING WALL LIGNIN-1 and 2 (At1g31720/MWL-1 and At4g19370/MWL-2) Function Redundantly to Alter Secondary Cell Wall Lignin Content.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0150254", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26930070}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009606", "name" "DESIGUAL/Modifying wall lignin-1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 130, "alignment:full" 3895}}}
