{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the enzyme Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase, predominantly found in bacteria. This protein catalyses the specific phosphorylation of 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc) with the simultaneous cleavage of the 1,6-anhydro ring, generating MurNAc-6-P. It is also required for the utilisation of anhMurNAc, either imported from the medium, or derived from its own cell wall murein, and in so doing plays a role in cell wall recycling [[cite:PUB00046146], [cite:PUB00043013]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Levoglucosan kinase from the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi, which catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to levoglucosan (1,6-anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose, LG) to yield glucose 6-phosphate in the presence of magnesium ion and ATP [[cite:PUB00100278], [cite:PUB00100277]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8cpb", "name" "1,6-anhydro-n-actetylmuramic acid kinase (AnmK) in complex with AMPPNP, and AnhMurNAc at 1.7 Angstroms resolution."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30605" "ANHYDRO-N-ACETYLMURAMIC ACID KINASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01270" "Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase [anmK]"}, "pfam" {"PF03702" "Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase", "short" "Anhydro_N_Ac-Mur_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 66, "proteomes" 5267, "taxa" 20872, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23532, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17530}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1623", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1623"} {"accession" "GenProp0766", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0766"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
