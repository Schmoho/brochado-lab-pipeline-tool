{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ComS, a protein 46 amino acids in length, is described as the product of a gene fully embedded in the much longer gene srfAB, which encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase subunit involved in surfactin biosynthesis. The gene is encoded on the same strand, allowing ComS to be produced from the same mRNA as SrfAB. ComS is seen as crucial for competence development as it prevents proteolytic degradation of ComK, the key transcriptional activator of all genes required for the uptake and integration of DNA [[cite:PUB00158891], [cite:PUB00052317]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17584" "Bacillus competence protein S"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacillus competence protein S", "short" "ComS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 26, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035139", :literature {"PUB00158891" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hamoen LW" "Eshuis H" "Jongbloed J" "Venema G" "van Sinderen D."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02220.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "A small gene, designated comS, located within the coding region of the fourth amino acid-activation domain of srfA, is required for competence development in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "55-63", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7752896}, "PUB00052317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ogura M" "Liu L" "Lacelle M" "Nakano MM" "Zuber P."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
