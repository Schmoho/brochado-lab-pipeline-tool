Histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) is critical for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction [[cite:PUB00096023]]. Suv4-20 family members are a group of histone H4K20 methyltransferases that play an important role in epigenetic regulation. Lower eukaryotes have a single Suv4-20, while mammals have two closely related Suv4-20 paralogs, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2 [[cite:PUB00096027]]. In mammals H4K20me2 is generated primarily by SUV420H1/KMT5B (which can also produce H4K20me3), while H4K20me3 is mostly generated by SUV420H2/KMT5C [[cite:PUB00096022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rq4", "name" "Crystal structure of suppressor of variegation 4-20 homolog 2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51570" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43) family profile"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Suv4-20 family, animal", "short" "Suv4-20_animal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 819, "taxa" 3448, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2183, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2183, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1175}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
