{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CNL1 (CNO-like protein 1) is a component of the yeast biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1), a complex that is involved in sorting cargo to lysosome-related organelles and endosomes [[cite:PUB00067529]].  The yeast BLOC-1 consists of six subunits. BLOC-1 functions as an endosomal Rab-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) adapter complex in yeast. It controls the lifetime of active Rab5/Vps21 and thus is involved in endosomal maturation along the endocytic pathway [[cite:PUB00083571]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39145" "BIOGENESIS OF LYSOSOME-RELATED ORGANELLES COMPLEX 1 SUBUNIT CNL1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1, subunit CNL1", "short" "CNL1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 728, "taxa" 1894, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1057, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 686}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034455", :literature {"PUB00067529" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hayes MJ" "Bryon K" "Satkurunathan J" "Levine TP."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01151.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Yeast homologues of three BLOC-1 subunits highlight KxDL proteins as conserved interactors of BLOC-1.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "260-8", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21159114}, "PUB00083571" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["John Peter AT" "Lachmann J" "Rana M" "Bunge M" "Cabrera M" "Ungermann C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
