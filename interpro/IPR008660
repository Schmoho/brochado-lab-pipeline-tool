{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several moth fibroin light chain (L-fibroin) proteins. Fibroin of Bombyx mori is secreted into the lumen of posterior silk gland (PSG) from the surrounding PSG cells as a molecular complex consisting of a heavy (H)-chain of approximately 350kDa, a light (L)-chain of 25kDa and a P25 of about 27kDa. The H- and L-chains are disulphide-linked but P25 is associated with the H-L complex by non-covalent force [[cite:PUB00011361]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05849" "Fibroin light chain (L-fibroin)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005765" "Fibroin light chain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fibroin light chain", "short" "L-fibroin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 186, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 76, "sets" 0, "proteins" 74, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 50}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008660", :literature {"PUB00011361" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tanaka K" "Kajiyama N" "Ishikura K" "Waga S" "Kikuchi A" "Ohtomo K" "Takagi T" "Mizuno S."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
