{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NCR3, also known as NKp30, is a natural cytotoxicity receptor expressed on natural killer (NK)  cells. It is critically involved in direct cytotoxicity against various tumour cells and directs both maturation and selective killing of dendritic cells [[cite:PUB00093801]]. In humans the cell-encoded ligands of NKp30 have been reported, such as heparan sulphates, Galectin-3 , the intracellular protein BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG-6) and the TM cell surface protein B7H6. Several alternative ligands have been reported for NKp30, including pp65 from CMV 11, HA from poxviruses including Vaccinia virus, Duffy binding-ike domain 1alpha from Plasmodium falciparum, and beta-1,3-glucans from the pathogenic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans [[cite:PUB00093802]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9fww", "name" "Human NKp30 in complex with a VHH variant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47904" "NATURAL CYTOTOXICITY TRIGGERING RECEPTOR 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3", "short" "NCR3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 138, "taxa" 551, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 464, "sets" 0, "proteins" 464, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 245}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043226", :literature {"PUB00093802" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bjornsen EG" "Thiruchelvam-Kyle L" "Hoelsbrekken SE" "Henden C" "Saether PC" "Boysen P" "Daws MR" "Dissen E."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
