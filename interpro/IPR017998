{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein folding is thought to be the sole result of properties inherent in polypeptide primary sequences. Sometimes, however, additional proteins are required to mediate correct folding and subsequent oligomer assembly [[cite:PUB00004022]]. These `helpers', or chaperones, bind to specific protein surfaces, preventing incorrect folding and formation of non-functional structures [[cite:PUB00001821]].</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The tailless complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) is a highly structurally conserved molecular chaperone located in the cytosol [[cite:PUB00044610]]. The protein has also been shown to bind to Golgi membranes and to microtubules, this latter property suggesting a role in mitotic spindle formation in dividing cells (especially in sperm, where it is highly abundant) [[cite:PUB00004112]]. TCP-1 forms a double ring structure, similar to the 10kDa and 60kDa chaperonins, with 6-8 subunits per ring. The amino acid sequence is significantly similar to the 60kDa chaperonin, and to TF55, a chaperone from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus shibatae [[cite:PUB00004112]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027410", "name" "TCP-1-like chaperonin intermediate domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027413", "name" "GroEL-like equatorial domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11353" "CHAPERONIN"}, "prints" {"PR00304" "TCOMPLEXTCP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperone tailless complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1)", "short" "Chaperone_TCP-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 137, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3335, "taxa" 16127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 68740, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39600}, "pathways" 46}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
