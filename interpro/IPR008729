{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes several bacterial phenolic acid decarboxylase proteins. Phenolic acids, also called substituted cinnamic acids, are important lignin-related aromatic acids and natural constituents of plant cell walls. These acids (particularly ferulic, p-coumaric, and caffeic acids) bind the complex lignin polymer to the hemicellulose and cellulose in plants. The phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD) gene (pad) is transcriptionally regulated by p-coumaric, ferulic, or caffeic acid; these three acids are the three substrates of PAD [[cite:PUB00011411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2p8g", "name" "Crystal structure of phenolic acid decarboxylase (2635953) from Bacillus subtilis at 1.36 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012674", "name" "Calycin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14241" "Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase"}, "panther" {"PTHR40087" "PHENOLIC ACID DECARBOXYLASE PADC"}, "pfam" {"PF05870" "Phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011561" "Phenolic acid decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phenolic acid decarboxylase", "short" "PA_de_COase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 702, "taxa" 2899, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2113, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1459}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
