{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides). GldI is a FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ([interpro:IPR001179]) linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Knockout of this gene abolishes the gliding phenotype [[cite:PUB00045355]]. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species C. johnsonae. This family is only found in Bacteroidetes containing the suite of genes proposed to confer the gliding motility phenotype.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046357", "name" "Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03516" "gliding motility-associated peptidyl-prolyl isomerase GldI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility-associated, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, GldI", "short" "Motility-assoc_PPIase_GldI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 336, "taxa" 1029, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 968, "sets" 0, "proteins" 968, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 804}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019869", :literature {"PUB00045355" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["McBride MJ" "Braun TF."], "ISO_journal" "J.
