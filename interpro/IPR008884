{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of bacterial macrocin O-methyltransferase (TylF) proteins. TylF is responsible for the methylation of macrocin to produce tylosin. Tylosin is a macrolide antibiotic used in veterinary medicine to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria and as an animal growth promoter in the Sus scrofa (Pig) industry. It is produced by several Streptomyces species. As with other macrolides, the antibiotic activity of tylosin is due to the inhibition of protein biosynthesis by a mechanism that involves the binding of tylosin to the ribosome, preventing the formation of the mRNA-aminoacyl-tRNA-ribosome complex [[cite:PUB00011510]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5i10", "name" "Crystal structure of spinosyn rhamnosyl 4'-O-methyltransferase spnh mutant T242Q from Saccharopolyspora Spinosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40036" "MACROCIN O-METHYLTRANSFERASE"}, "pfam" {"PF05711" "Macrocin-O-methyltransferase (TylF)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Macrocin-O-methyltransferase", "short" "TylF_MeTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 112, "proteomes" 1426, "taxa" 7726, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8338, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8323, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6136}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
