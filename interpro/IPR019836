{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This model describes a nearly twenty member protein family in Verrucomicrobium spinosum and a somewhat smaller paralogous family in Chthoniobacter flavus. All members share a type IV pilin-like N-terminal leader sequence  ([interpro:IPR012902]). These proteins occur in the four-gene Verru_Chthon cassette, in which two other genes likewise encode a cleavage/methylation domain. Most of these cassettes occur next to an unusually large PEP-CTERM protein with an autotransporter domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02596" "Verru_Chthon cassette protein D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Verru/Chthon cassette protein D", "short" "Verru/Chthon_D"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 58, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 147, "sets" 0, "proteins" 147, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 117}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0663", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0663"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019836", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019836", "name" "Verru/Chthon cassette protein D", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
