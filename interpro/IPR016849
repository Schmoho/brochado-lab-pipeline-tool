{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rtt109, also known as KAT11, is fungal-specific histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that modifies histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) to promote genome stability and resistance to a variety of DNA-damaging agents. Rtt109 does not show sequence conservation with other known HATs and depends on association with either of two histone chaperones, Asf1 or Vps75, for HAT activity [[cite:PUB00049390], [cite:PUB00051225], [cite:PUB00051187], [cite:PUB00099563], [cite:PUB00099564]].</p>\n\n<p>Rtt109-type HAT domain consists of a core HAT subdomain, which binds the acetyl-CoA cofactor. A second subdomain, the activation subdomain, is tightly associated with the HAT subdomain. Autoacetylation of a lysine within the activation subdomain is required for stabilising the interaction between the two subdomains and is essential for catalysis. The Rtt109-type HAT domain contains eight β strands and nine α helices and displays mixed three-layered α/β architecture with eight β strands sandwiched by five α helices (α1-α5) from one side, and four α helices (α6-α9) from the other side [[cite:PUB00049390], [cite:PUB00051225], [cite:PUB00051187]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7bx0", "name" "Crystal structure of RTT109 from Candida albicans"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51728" "Rtt109-type histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain profile"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF027124" "Histone acetylase, Rtt109 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone acetyltransferase Rtt109", "short" "Rtt109"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1151, "taxa" 3047, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1638, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1637, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1026}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
