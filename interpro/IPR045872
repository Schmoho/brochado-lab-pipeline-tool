{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arf GTPases are involved in the formation of coated carrier vesicles by recruiting coat proteins. This entry includes Arf1, Arf2, Arf3, Arf4, Arf5, and related proteins. Each contains an N-terminal myristoylated amphipathic helix that is folded into the protein in the GDP-bound state. GDP/GTP exchange exposes the helix, which anchors to the membrane. Following GTP hydrolysis, the helix dissociates from the membrane and folds back into the protein. A general feature of Arf1-5 signaling may be the cooperation of two Arfs at the same site. Arfs1-5 are generally considered to be interchangeable in function and location, but some specific functions have been assigned [[cite:PUB00099172]].</p>\n\n<p>Arf1 localizes to the early/cis-Golgi, where it is activated by GBF1 and recruits the coat protein COPI. It also localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it is activated by BIG1/BIG2 and recruits the AP1, AP3, AP4, and GGA proteins [[cite:PUB00099170]]. Humans, but not rodents and other lower eukaryotes, lack Arf2. Human Arf3 shares 96% sequence identity with Arf1 and is believed to generally function interchangeably with Arf1. Human Arf4 in the activated (GTP-bound) state has been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mediate the EGF-dependent activation of phospholipase D2 (PLD2), leading to activation of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor [[cite:PUB00099175]]. Arf4 has also been shown to recognise the C-terminal sorting signal of rhodopsin and regulate its incorporation into specialised post-Golgi rhodopsin transport carriers (RTCs) [[cite:PUB00099171]]. There is some evidence that Arf5 functions at the early-Golgi and the trans-Golgi to affect Golgi-associated alpha-adaptin homology Arf-binding proteins (GGAs) [[cite:PUB00099173]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1r8s", "name" "ARF1[DELTA1-17]-GDP IN COMPLEX WITH A SEC7 DOMAIN CARRYING THE MUTATION OF THE CATALYTIC GLUTAMATE TO LYSINE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04150" "ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (Arf1) and ADP-ribosylation factor-5 (Arf5)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor 1-5", "short" "Arf1-5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 64, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2534, "taxa" 9001, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9546, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6015}, "pathways" 87}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
