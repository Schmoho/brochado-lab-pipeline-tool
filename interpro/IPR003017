{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amphiphysins belong to the expanding BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) family proteins, all members of which share a highly conserved N-terminal BAR domain, which has predicted coiled-coil structures required for amphiphysin dimerisation and plasma membrane interaction [[cite:PUB00014927]]. Almost all members also share a conserved C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which mediates their interactions with the GTPase dynamin and the inositol-5'-phosphatase synaptojanin 1 in vertebrates and with actin in yeast. The central region of all these proteins is most variable. In mammals, the central region of amphiphysin I and amphiphysin IIa contains a proline-arginine-rich region for endophilin binding and a CLAP domain, for binding to clathrin and AP-2. The interactions mediated by both the central and C-terminal domains are believed to be modulated by protein phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00006137], [cite:PUB00006087]].</p>\n\n<p>Amphiphysins are proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis clathrin-mediated endocytosis, actin function, and signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00014927], [cite:PUB00100498]].</p>\n\n<p>Amphiphysin 1 was first identified in 1992 as a brain protein that was partially-associated with synaptic vesicles. Following its cloning, it was also realised to be a human auto-antigen that is detected in a rare neurological disease, Stiff-Man Syndrome, and also in certain types of cancer [[cite:PUB00006143]]. Amphiphysin 1 senses and facilitates membrane curvature to mediate synaptic vesicles invagination and fission during newly retrieved presynaptic vesicle formation and also acts as a linker protein binding with dynamin, clathrin, Amphiphysin II, and other dephosphins in the clathrin-coated complex. Amphiphysin 1 is cleaved an asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), which generates a fragment that increases with aging. This fragment disrupts the normal endocytic function of Amphiphysin 1, leading to synaptic dysfunction, as it activates CDK5 inducing tau hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, Amphiphysin 1 posttranslational modification contributes to pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, being the AEP a therapeutic target [[cite:PUB00100498]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027267", "name" "AH/BAR domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01252" "AMPHIPHYSIN1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amphiphysin, isoform 1", "short" "Amphiphysin_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 504, "taxa" 1790, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1370, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 772}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003017", :literature {"PUB00014927" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Zhang B" "Zelhof AC."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0854.2002.30702.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Amphiphysins: raising the BAR for synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane dynamics.
