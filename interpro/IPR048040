It is negatively correlated with the tumor purity of oral squamous cell carcinoma and positively correlated with the immune infiltration of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. It has been reported that down-regulation of Rab19 antagonized the aggressive behaviors of gastric cancer [[cite:PUB00151252]].</p>\n\n<p>Rab43 plays a neuron-specific role in targeting and sorting of GPCRs. It differentially regulates the overall surface expression of endogenous alpha2-adrenergic receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and their signaling, in primary neurons. Moreover, Rab43 exerts distinct effects on the  dendritic and postsynaptic transport of specific receptors subtypes [[cite:PUB00151254]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}],
