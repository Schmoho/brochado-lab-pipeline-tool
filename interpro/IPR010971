{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of FAD-dependent hydroxylases (monooxygenases), which are all believed to act in the aerobic ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00013848]]. In Escherichia coli, three enzyme activities have been described: UbiI, UbiH and UbiF [[cite:PUB00068672]].  UbiH and UbiF are similar to one another and form the basis of this subfamily.  UbiI (also known as visC) [[cite:PUB00068672]] is highly similar to UbiF, adjacent to UbiH and, when mutated, results in a phenotype similar to that of UbiH (also known as visB) [[cite:PUB00013761]].  Several other species appear to have three homologues in this family, although they assort themselves differently on phylogenetic trees (e.g. Xylella and Mesorhizobium) making it difficult to ascribe a specific activity to each one.  Eukaryotes appear to have only a single homologue in this subfamily (COQ6, [[cite:PUB00013831]]) which complements UbiH, but also possess a non-orthologous gene, COQ7 which complements UbiF.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4k22", "name" "Structure of the C-terminal truncated form of E.Coli C5-hydroxylase UBII involved in ubiquinone (Q8) biosynthesis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01988" "ubiquinone biosynthesis hydroxylase, UbiH/UbiF/VisC/COQ6 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquinone biosynthesis hydroxylase UbiH/COQ6", "short" "UbiH/COQ6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5599, "taxa" 21008, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32779, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32769, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24660}, "pathways" 127}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC01008", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC01008"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"} {"accession" "GenProp1744", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1744"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
