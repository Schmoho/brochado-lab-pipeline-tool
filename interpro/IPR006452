{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains formate dehydrogenase accessory protein FdhE and its homologues, found largely in proteobacteria, where the fdhE genes are almost always genetically-linked to the structural genes for formate dehydrogenases [[cite:PUB00009643]]. FdhE is required for the assembly of formate dehydrogenase although not present in the final complex. In E.coli, FdhE interacts with the catalytic subunits of the respiratory formate dehydrogenases. FdhE is an iron-binding rubredoxin that can adopt monomeric and homodimeric forms. E.coli FdhE interacts with the catalytic subunits, FdnG and FdoG, of the Tat-dependent respiratory formate dehydrogenases. Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that conserved cysteine motifs are essential for the physiological activity of the FdhE protein and are also involved in Fe(III) ligation. The iron likely is redox active, suggesting that the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions may be important in modulating FdhE function. Alternatively, FdhE may be involved in an electron transfer reaction, similar to other rubredoxins [[cite:PUB00106621], [cite:PUB00104131], [cite:PUB00013624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024064", "name" "FdhE-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16341" "formate dehydrogenase accessory protein FdhE and similar proteins"}, "panther" {"PTHR37689" "PROTEIN FDHE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00611" "Protein FdhE [fdhE]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01562" "formate dehydrogenase accessory protein FdhE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018296" "Formate dehydrogenase accessory protein FdhE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Formate dehydrogenase accessory protein", "short" "Formate_DH_accessory"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 865, "taxa" 5216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5800, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5799, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4643}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006452", :literature {"PUB00009643" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Schlindwein C" "Giordano G" "Santini CL" "Mandrand MA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
