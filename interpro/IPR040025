{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins that contain at least two copies of a C2H2-type zinc finger, including cytoplasmic 60S subunit biogenesis factor ZNF622 from animals [[cite:PUB00101068]], Reh1 and Rei1 from budding yeasts, and core trichothecene cluster protein 15 (TRI15) from Fusarium.</p>\n\n<p>Cytoplasmic 60S subunit biogenesis factor ZNF622, Reh1 and Rei1 are involved in maturation of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit. Rei1 is required for re-importing the 60S subunit export factor Arx1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and both Reh1 and Rei1 are required for cytoplasmic maturation of the 60S subunit, that the two proteins have redundant functions, but without both the 60S subunit is labile to salt [[cite:PUB00090437]].</p>\n\n<p>TRI15 is a component in the biosynthesis of trichothecene mycotoxins, although its role is unknown [[cite:PUB00087315]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13182" "ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 622"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger protein 622/Rei1/Reh1", "short" "Znf622/Rei1/Reh1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2613, "taxa" 8947, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5729, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3684}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040025", :literature {"PUB00101068" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Lv K" "Gong C" "Antony C" "Han X" "Ren JG" "Donaghy R" "Cheng Y" "Pellegrino S" "Warren AJ" "Paralkar VR" "Tong W."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Stem Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Stem Cell", "title" "HectD1 controls hematopoietic stem cell regeneration by coordinating ribosome assembly and protein synthesis.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "1275-1290.e9", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33711283}, "PUB00090437" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Parnell KM" "Bass BL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
