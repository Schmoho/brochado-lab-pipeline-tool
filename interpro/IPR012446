{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Drosophila Orai and human Orai1, Orai2 and Orai3. ORAI-1 green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters are co-expressed with STIM-1 (ER CA(2+) sensors) in the gonad and intestine. The protein has four predicted transmembrane domains with a highly conserved region between TM2 ad TM3. This conserved domain is thought to function in channel regulation. ORAI1-related proteins are required for the production of the calcium channel, CRAC, along with STIM1-related proteins [[cite:PUB00055566]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038350", "name" "Orai superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31501" "CALCIUM RELEASE-ACTIVATED CALCIUM CHANNEL PROTEIN 1"}, "pfam" {"PF07856" "Mediator of CRAC channel activity"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Calcium release-activated calcium channel protein", "short" "CRAC_channel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 54, "proteomes" 1112, "taxa" 4403, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3921, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2608}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012446", :literature {"PUB00055566" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["Lorin-Nebel C" "Xing J" "Yan X" "Strange K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
