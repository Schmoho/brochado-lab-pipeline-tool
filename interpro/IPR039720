{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Transmembrane protein 94 (TMEM94), also known as endoplasmic reticulum magnesium-transporting P-type ATPase ERMA., a protein that could function in the uptake of Mg2 from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum and regulate intracellular Mg2 homeostasis [[cite:PUB00154513]]. TMEM94 deletion in mice is embryonically lethal, and TMEM94 mutations in humans are associated with multi-organ functional defects revealing its essential function [[cite:PUB00154512]]. TMEM94 has been proposed as a major molecular component of ERMg2+ uptake machinery in eukaryotes and its absence could lead to perturbation of signal transduction and detrimental physiological outcomes [[cite:PUB00154513]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13219" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 94"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane protein 94", "short" "TMEM94"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1190, "taxa" 4661, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3466, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3466, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 904}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039720", :literature {"PUB00154513" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Vishnu N" "Venkatesan M" "Madaris TR" "Venkateswaran MK" "Stanley K" "Ramachandran K" "Chidambaram A" "Madesh AK" "Yang W" "Nair J" "Narkunan M" "Muthukumar T" "Karanam V" "Joseph LC" "Le A" "Osidele A" "Aslam MI" "Morrow JP" "Malicdan MC" "Stathopulos PB" "Madesh M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.02.033", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "ERMA (TMEM94) is a P-type ATPase transporter for Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake in the endoplasmic reticulum.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "1321-1337.e11", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38513662}, "PUB00154512" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Stephen J" "Maddirevula S" "Nampoothiri S" "Burke JD" "Herzog M" "Shukla A" "Steindl K" "Eskin A" "Patil SJ" "Joset P" "Lee H" "Garrett LJ" "Yokoyama T" "Balanda N" "Bodine SP" "Tolman NJ" "Zerfas PM" "Zheng A" "Ramantani G" "Girisha KM" "Rivas C" "Suresh PV" "Elkahloun A" "Alsaif HS" "Wakil SM" "Mahmoud L" "Ali R" "Prochazkova M; Undiagnosed Diseases Network members" "Kulkarni AB" "Ben-Omran T" "Colak D" "Morris HD" "Rauch A" "Martinez-Agosto JA" "Nelson SF" "Alkuraya FS" "Gahl WA" "Malicdan MCV."], "ISO_journal" "Am J Hum Genet", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.11.001", "medline_journal" "Am J Hum Genet", "title" "Bi-allelic TMEM94 Truncating Variants Are Associated with Neurodevelopmental Delay, Congenital Heart Defects, and Distinct Facial Dysmorphism.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "948-967", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30526868}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039720", "name" "Transmembrane protein 94", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
