{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents nonspecific acid phosphatases, class A [[cite:PUB00014389], [cite:PUB00003588]]. Non-specific acid phosphatases are bacterial enzymes that catalyse the dephosphorylation of orthophosphoric monoesters to alcohol and phosphate, in addition to being able to catalyse transphosphorylation. As their name suggests, they show broad specificity, being able to phosphorylate a wide range of hydroxy compounds. During active catalysis, an activated phospho-enzyme intermediate is formed that is able to transfer its phosphate group to water, glucose or inosine. Nonspecific acid phosphatases share a conserved active site with mammalian glucose-6-phosphatases (G6Pase) [[cite:PUB00014807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1d2t", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ACID PHOSPHATASE FROM ESCHERICHIA BLATTAE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036938", "name" "Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2/haloperoxidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03397" "PAP2_acid_phosphatase"}, "prints" {"PR00483" "BACPHPHTASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000897" "Nonspecific acid phosphatase, class A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acid phosphatase, class A, bacterial", "short" "Acid_Pase_classA_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 780, "taxa" 4538, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6330, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5426, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4293}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00891", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00891"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
