{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chloroplast RNA splicing 2 (CRS2) are nuclear-encoded proteins required for the splicing of group II introns in chloroplasts. CRS2 forms stable complexes with two CRS2-associated factors, CAF1 and CAF2, which are required for the splicing of distinct subsets of CRS2-dependent introns. CRS2 is closely related to bacterial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases (PTH) [[cite:PUB00030843], [cite:PUB00043746]].
