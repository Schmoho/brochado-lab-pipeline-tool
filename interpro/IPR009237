{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Unique short glycoprotein 2 (US2) and US3 are Herpesviral proteins that interfere with the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. US2 is an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane protein that binds to newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains in the endoplasmic reticulum, redirecting them to the cytosol for proteasome-dependent destruction, thereby preventing their expression at the cell surface [[cite:PUB00034767]]. US3 is similarly an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane glycoprotein that binds MHC class I molecules and prevents their departure. The endoplasmic reticulum retention signal of the US3 protein is contained in the luminal domain of the protein [[cite:PUB00011935]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014756", "name" "Immunoglobulin E-set", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05963" "Cytomegalovirus US3 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus US2/US3", "short" "Herpes_US2/US3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 30, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 104, "sets" 0, "proteins" 104, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009237", :literature {"PUB00011935" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lee S" "Park B" "Ahn K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
