{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The galanin-like peptide (GALP) exists in two isoforms which have different physiological functions. Isoform 1 is a neuropeptide from the hypothalamus that binds to the G-protein-coupled galanin receptors and is required for regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion amongst other central nervous system homeostatic processes [[cite:PUB00018000]]. Isoform 2 (also known as alarin), produced by alternative splicing and sharing only the N-terminal pentapeptide with mature isoform 1, is a vasoconstrictor in the microvasculature of the skin and does not bind to G-protein-coupled galanin receptors. It also has antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00089351]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR20950" "GALANIN-RELATED PEPTIDE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Galanin-like peptide", "short" "GALP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 61, "taxa" 227, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 103, "sets" 0, "proteins" 103, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 59}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039244", :literature {"PUB00018000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Ohtaki T" "Kumano S" "Ishibashi Y" "Ogi K" "Matsui H" "Harada M" "Kitada C" "Kurokawa T" "Onda H" "Fujino M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
