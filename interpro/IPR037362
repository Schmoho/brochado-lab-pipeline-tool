{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The CAS (Crk-Associated Substrate) protein family is a group of scaffolding proteins that play important modulatory roles in both normal and pathological cell growth regulation. They contain an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a substrate domain (SD).  The SD contains a large number of YxxP motifs, which when phosphorylated by Src-family kinases provide canonical binding sites for proteins containing SH2 domains such as Crk, Crk-L, CRKII [[cite:PUB00069470]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wyx", "name" "The Crystal Structure of the p130Cas SH3 Domain at 1.1 A Resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038319", "name" "CAS, serine rich four helix bundle domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10654" "CAS SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CAS family", "short" "CAS_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 974, "taxa" 3860, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5583, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3552}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037362", :literature {"PUB00069470" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Tikhmyanova N" "Little JL" "Golemis EA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
