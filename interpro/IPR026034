{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MreD  (murein formation D) protein is involved in bacterial cell shape determination [[cite:PUB00056833], [cite:PUB00059314]]. Most rod-shaped bacteria depend on MreB and RodA to achieve either a rod shape or some other non-spherical morphology such as coil or stalk formation. MreD is encoded in an operon with MreB, and often with RodA and PBP-2 as well. It is highly hydrophobic (therefore somewhat low-complexity) and highly divergent, and therefore cannot always be identified on the basis of sequence similarity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the proteobacterial MreD proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37484" "ROD SHAPE-DETERMINING PROTEIN MRED"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018472" "Rod shape determining protein MreD, proteobacterial type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell shape-determining protein MreD, proteobacterial type", "short" "MreD_proteobac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1718, "taxa" 7897, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8506, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8505, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6592}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026034", :literature {"PUB00056833" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Wachi M" "Doi M" "Okada Y" "Matsuhashi M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
