{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Progesterone-induced-blocking factor 1 (PIBF1) is an immunomodulatory molecule secreted by pregnancy lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00060722]]. It exerts immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting NK cell activity, polarising immune responses towards TH2 dominance and down-regulating effector cytokine response [[cite:PUB00060723]]. It is thought to play a vital role in preventing rejection of the embryo by the maternal immune response. PIBF1 may also have a role in cancer. It is produced by malignant tumours and may facilitate tumour growth by suppressing local antitumour immune responses [[cite:PUB00060724]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18950" "PROGESTERONE-INDUCED BLOCKING FACTOR 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Progesterone-induced-blocking factor 1", "short" "PIBF1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 791, "taxa" 3046, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1877, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1877, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1184}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026205", :literature {"PUB00060723" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lachmann M" "Gelbmann D" "Kalman E" "Polgar B" "Buschle M" "Von Gabain A" "Szekeres-Bartho J" "Nagy E."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
