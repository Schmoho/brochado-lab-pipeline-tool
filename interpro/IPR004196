{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The assembly of a macromolecular structure proceeds via a specific pathway of ordered events and occurs by changing of protein conformations as they join the assembly. The assembly process is aided by scaffolding proteins, which act as chaperones. In bacteriophages, scaffolding proteins B and D are responsible for procapsid formation. Copies of protein D (240) form the external scaffold, while 60 copies of protein B form the internal scaffold [[cite:PUB00007418]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036632", "name" "Scaffold protein D superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02925" "Bacteriophage scaffolding protein D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Scaffold protein D", "short" "Scaffold_D"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 98, "taxa" 831, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 355, "sets" 0, "proteins" 354, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 177}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004196", :literature {"PUB00007418" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6648", "authors" ["Dokland T" "McKenna R" "Ilag LL" "Bowman BR" "Incardona NL" "Fane BA" "Rossmann MG."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/38537", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of a viral procapsid with molecular scaffolding.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "308-13", "volume" "389", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9305849}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046797", "name" "viral procapsid maturation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004196", "name" "Scaffold protein D", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 92}}}
