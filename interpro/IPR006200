{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LexA acts as a homodimer to repress a number of genes involved in the response to DNA damage (SOS response), including itself and RecA. RecA, in the presence of single-stranded DNA, acts as a co-protease to activate a latent autolytic protease activity ([ec:3.4.21.88]) of LexA, where the active site Ser is part of LexA. The autolytic cleavage site is an Ala-Gly bond in LexA (at position 84-85 in E. coli LexA; this sequence is replaced by Gly-Gly in Synechocystis). The cleavage leads to derepression of the SOS regulon and eventually to DNA repair. LexA in Bacillus subtilis is called DinR. LexA is much less broadly distributed than RecA [[cite:PUB00017442], [cite:PUB00017443]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6a2t", "name" "Mycobacterium tuberculosis LexA C-domain K197A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036286", "name" "LexA/Signal peptidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00015" "LexA repressor [lexA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00498" "transcriptional repressor LexA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription regulator LexA", "short" "LexA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7075, "taxa" 27405, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33396, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33396, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25695}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0215", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0215"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
