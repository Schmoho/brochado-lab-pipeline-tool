{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents an RNA pyrophosphohydrolase belonging to the nudix hydrolase family, RppH subfamily which includes RppH from bacteria and NUD25-27 from plants. RppH accelerates the degradation of transcripts by removing pyrophosphate from the 5'-end of triphosphorylated RNA, leading to a more labile monophosphorylated state that can stimulate subsequent ribonuclease cleavage [[cite:PUB00046111]].  NUD25-27 mediate the hydrolysis of some nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. They can use diadenosine 5',5'''-P1P5 pentaphosphate (Ap5A) as substrates [[cite:PUB00158845], [cite:PUB00070213]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4s2v", "name" "E. coli RppH structure, KI soak"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03671" "plant diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) hydrolase and similar proteins"}, "hamap" {"MF_00298" "RNA pyrophosphohydrolase [rppH]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH", "short" "RppH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3518, "taxa" 14335, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15089, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11629}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
