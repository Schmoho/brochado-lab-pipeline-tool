{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents reverse gyrases found in both bacteria and archaea. Reverse gyrase, a fusion of a type I topoisomerase domain and a helicase domain, introduces positive supercoiling to increase the melting temperature of DNA double strands. Generally, these gyrases are encoded as a single polypeptide. An exception was found in Methanopyrus kandleri, where enzyme is split within the topoisomerase domain, yielding a heterodimer of gene products designated RgyB and RgyA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>DNA topoisomerases are divided into two classes: type I enzymes ([ec:5.99.1.2]; topoisomerases I, III and V) break single-strand DNA, and type II enzymes ([ec:5.99.1.3]; topoisomerases II, IV and VI) break double-strand DNA [[cite:PUB00020793]]. Type I topoisomerases can be subdivided according to their structure and reaction mechanisms: type IA (bacterial and archaeal topoisomerase I, topoisomerase III and reverse gyrase) and type IB (eukaryotic topoisomerase I and topoisomerase V). Most of the Type I topoisomerases are ATP-independent and are responsible for relaxing positively and/or negatively supercoiled DNA. Reverse gyrase is a unique type IA topoisomerase in that it requires ATP and can introduce positive supercoils into DNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43505" "REVERSE GYRASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01125" "Reverse gyrase [rgy]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01054" "reverse gyrase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Reverse gyrase", "short" "Reverse_gyrase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 101, "taxa" 975, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1494, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1486, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1254}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
