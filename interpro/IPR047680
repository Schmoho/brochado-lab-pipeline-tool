{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The founding member of this family of membrane-spanning serine proteases, which is found mainly in Actinobacteria, is the acid resistance periplasmic serine protease MarP of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recent work shows that MarP is required to cleave and activate the peptidoglycan hydrolase RipA, and loss of RipA activity creates a defect in progeny separation during cell division. Therefore, the requirement for MarP in order to survive acidic conditions may be a consequence of peptidoglycan hydrolysis requirements, explaining why MarP family members are distributed more broadly in the Actinobacteria than the subset of species capable of surviving intracellularly as pathogens [[cite:PUB00105289], [cite:PUB00105290], [cite:PUB00105291]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3k6y", "name" "Crystal structure of Rv3671c protease from M. tuberculosis, active form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033740" "MarP family serine protease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine protease MarP-like", "short" "MarP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1566, "taxa" 4515, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5024, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5024, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3858}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
