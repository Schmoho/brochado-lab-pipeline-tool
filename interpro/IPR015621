{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta) are cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and hematopoiesis [[cite:PUB00007346]]. Two types of IL-1 receptor, each with three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, limited sequence similarity (28%) and different pharmacological characteristics have been cloned from mouse and human cell lines: these have been termed type I and type II receptors [[cite:PUB00007347]]. The receptors both exist in transmembrane (TM) and soluble forms: the soluble IL-1 receptor is thought to be post-translationally derived from cleavage of the extracellular portion of the membrane receptors. Both IL-1 receptors appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location [[cite:PUB00007348]]. The receptors can both bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1RA).</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA has been determined [[cite:PUB00007351]].
