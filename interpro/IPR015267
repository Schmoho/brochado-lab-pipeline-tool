{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein phosphatase 4 core regulatory subunit R2 (PPP4R2), also known as Psy4 in budding yeast, is the regulatory subunit of the histone H2A phosphatase complex. The histone H2A phosphatase complex dephosphorylates H2AS128ph (gamma-H2A) that has been displaced from sites of DNA lesions in the double-stranded DNA break repair process. Dephosphorylation of Psy4 is necessary for efficient recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint [[cite:PUB00078845]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09184" "PPP4R2"}, "panther" {"PTHR16487" "PPP4R2-RELATED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase 4 core regulatory subunit R2", "short" "PPP4R2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 51, "proteomes" 2378, "taxa" 8167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4449, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2807}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015267", :literature {"PUB00078845" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7075", "authors" ["Keogh MC" "Kim JA" "Downey M" "Fillingham J" "Chowdhury D" "Harrison JC" "Onishi M" "Datta N" "Galicia S" "Emili A" "Lieberman J" "Shen X" "Buratowski S" "Haber JE" "Durocher D" "Greenblatt JF" "Krogan NJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature04384", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates gammaH2AX regulates DNA damage checkpoint recovery.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "497-501", "volume" "439", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16299494}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019888", "name" "protein phosphatase regulator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030289", "name" "protein phosphatase 4 complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015267", "name" "Protein phosphatase 4 core regulatory subunit R2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 22, "alignment:full" 2480}}}
