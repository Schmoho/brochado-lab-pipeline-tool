{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent the hydroxylamine reductases (Hcp, also known as Prismane) and the Ni-containing CO dehydrogenases (CODH) ([ec:1.2.99.2]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hydroxylamine reductases have been identified in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotic protozoa. They contain two Fe/S centres - a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster, and a hybrid [4Fe-2S-2O] cluster.  The physiological role of this protein is as yet unknown, although a role in nitrate/nitrite respiration has been suggested [[cite:PUB00007375]]. The Hcp protein from Escherichia coli was shown to contain hydroxylamine reductase activity (NH2OH + 2e + 2 H+ ->NH3 + H2O). This activity is rather low [[cite:PUB00020178]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6yu9", "name" "CO-dehydrogenase homodimer from Clostridium autoethanogenum at 1.90-A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011254", "name" "Prismane-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016099", "name" "Prismane-like, alpha/beta-sandwich", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016100", "name" "Prismane, alpha-bundle", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016101", "name" "CO dehydrogenase, alpha-bundle", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30109" "HYDROXYLAMINE REDUCTASE"}, "pfam" {"PF03063" "Prismane/CO dehydrogenase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxylamine reductase/Ni-containing CO dehydrogenase", "short" "HCP/CODH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 93, "domain_architectures" 69, "proteomes" 1837, "taxa" 10143, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17199, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16365, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12817}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
