{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains MurR, which represses the expression of the murPQ operon involved in the uptake and degradation of N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). It binds to two adjacent inverted repeats within the operator region. MurNAc 6-phosphate and GlcNAc-6-phosphate can bind to MurR and weaken the DNA binding ability of MurR [[cite:PUB00151033]].</p>\n\n<p>MurR is paralogous to RpiR and has both HTH and SIS phosphosugar binding domains. The divergent murR and murQP transcripts have complementary 5' ends [[cite:PUB00053898]].
