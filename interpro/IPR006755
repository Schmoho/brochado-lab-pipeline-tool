{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>P0 is a suppressor of RNA-mediated gene silencing, also known as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), a mechanism of plant viral defense that limits the accumulation of viral RNAs. It targets ARGONAUTE proteins for degradation [[cite:PUB00084349]]. It may prevent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly by interacting with one of its protein components, thus inhibiting formation of siRNA/miRNA-RISC, and ultimately leading to ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) degradation [[cite:PUB00099684]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04662" "Luteovirus P0 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Suppressor of silencing P0", "short" "Virus_P0"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 49, "taxa" 103, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 522, "sets" 0, "proteins" 521, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006755", :literature {"PUB00084349" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Baumberger N" "Tsai CH" "Lie M" "Havecker E" "Baulcombe DC."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
