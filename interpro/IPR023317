{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Plasmin is a serine peptidase belonging to MEROPS peptidase family S1 (chymotrypsin family, clan PA(S)), subfamily S1A.\n\nPlasmin dissolves the fibrin of blood clots and acts as a proteolytic factor in a variety of other processes, including embryonic development, tissue remodeling, tumor invasion, and inflammation [[cite:PUB00100482]]; in ovulation it weakens the walls of the Graafian follicle. It activates the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, collagenases and several complement zymogens, such as C1 and C5. It cleaves fibrin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin and von Willebrand factor. Its specificity is similar to trypsin but it is less efficient and, thus, cleaves only after certain Lys and Arg residues.\n\nFollowing the signal sequence, plasmin contains one PAN (formerly apple) domain, five kringle domains, and a trypsin domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001150" "Plasmin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S1A, plasmin", "short" "Pept_S1A_plasmin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 506, "taxa" 1787, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1212, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1107, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 689}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2010", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2010"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
