{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>14-3-3 protein sigma isoform, also known as stratifin or human mammary epithelial marker (HME) 1, has been most directly linked to tumour development  [[cite:PUB00086950], [cite:PUB00086950]]. In humans, it is expressed by the SFN gene, strictly in stratified squamous epithelial cells in response to DNA damage where it is transcriptionally induced in a p53-dependent manner, subsequently causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint [[cite:PUB00086951]]. Up-regulation and down-regulation of 14-3-3 sigma expression have both been described in tumours. For example, in human breast cancer, 14-3-3 sigma is predominantly down-regulated by CpG methylation, acting as both a tumour suppressor and a prognostic indicator [[cite:PUB00086952]], while in human scirrhous-type gastric carcinoma (SGC), it is up-regulated and may play an important role in SGC carcinogenesis and progression [[cite:PUB00086953]]. Loss of 14-3-3 sigma expression sensitizes tumour cells to treatment with conventional cytostatic drugs, making this protein an attractive therapeutic target [[cite:PUB00086954]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7az2", "name" "14-3-3 sigma with Pin1 binding site pS72 and covalently bound LvD1014"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036815", "name" "14-3-3 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd10019" "14-3-3 sigma, an isoform of 14-3-3 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "14-3-3 protein sigma", "short" "14-3-3_sigma"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 141, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 113, "taxa" 437, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 141, "sets" 0, "proteins" 141, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 94}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037435", :literature {"PUB00086950" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lodygin D" "Hermeking H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.cr.7290292", "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "The role of epigenetic inactivation of 14-3-3sigma in human cancer.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "237-46", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15857578}, "PUB00086951" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hermeking H" "Lengauer C" "Polyak K" "He TC" "Zhang L" "Thiagalingam S" "Kinzler KW" "Vogelstein B."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
