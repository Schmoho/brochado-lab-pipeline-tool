{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group belongs to the ferritin domain superfamily and has the ferritin-like structural fold. Ferritins constitute a broad superfamily of iron storage proteins, widespread in all domains of life [[cite:PUB00016824], [cite:PUB00016871]]. Ferritins and bacterioferritins have essentially the same architecture, assembling in a 24mer cluster to form a hollow, roughly spherical, construction. This consists of a mineral core of hydrated ferric oxide and a multi-subunit protein shell, which encloses the former and assures its solubility in an aqueous environment. Due to the absence of the C-terminal fifth helix of 24mer ferritins, members of the Dps group assemble only to dodecameric protein shells [[cite:PUB00016788]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this entry were originally discovered as stress proteins, which protect DNA against oxidative stress during nutrient starvation [[cite:PUB00001907]], hence the name Dps (DNA protection during starvation protein). Several members of the group, such as Dps from Escherichia coli or the Dps homologue from Bacillus subtilis, exhibit a DNA-binding activity that is at least partially linked with iron complexation [[cite:PUB00016788]]. DNA binding by these proteins was shown to suffice for protection against oxidative DNA damage and might be mediated by magnesium ions, which bridge the protein surfaces with the polyanionic DNA [[cite:PUB00016778], [cite:PUB00016848]]. Functionally, this group is much more diverse, with many members promoting iron incorporation, while others act as immunogens, neutrophil activators [[cite:PUB00016792]], cold-shock proteins, or constituents of fine-tangled pili [[cite:PUB00016869]]. Another mode of protection against reactive oxygen species implies the preferential consumption of hydrogen peroxide instead of oxygen during biomineralization [[cite:PUB00016777]].</p>\n\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00016864], [cite:PUB00003004]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ak8", "name" "Crystal structure of the SEp22 dodecamer, a Dps-like protein from Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01043" "DPS protein, ferritin-like diiron-binding domain"}, "prints" {"PR01346" "HELNAPAPROT"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005900" "Ferritin-like protein, Dps type"}, "panther" {"PTHR42932" "GENERAL STRESS PROTEIN 20U"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding protein Dps", "short" "DPS_DNA-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 119, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6215, "taxa" 23980, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29586, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29581, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22957}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00645", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00645"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1113", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1113"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002177", :literature {"PUB00001907" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12B", "authors" ["Almiron M" "Link AJ" "Furlong D" "Kolter R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/12B/2646", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "A novel DNA-binding protein with regulatory and protective roles in starved Escherichia coli.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "2646-54", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1340475}, "PUB00003004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Bozzi M" "Mignogna G" "Stefanini S" "Barra D" "Longhi C" "Valenti P" "Chiancone E."], "ISO_journal" "J.
