{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of putative redox proteins includes DVU_1557 ([swissprot:Q72BS7]) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, as well as the related paralogues from Clostridium ljungdahlii. Members of this family are found in an extended conserved gene neighborhood that also includes a molybdopterin-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase and the radical SAM (seleno)protein TrsS. The presence in Clostridium ljungdahlii, a species apparently without heme biosynthesis, has implications for the electron transfer pathways to which the proteins of the conserved gene neighborhood contribute [[cite:PUB00154723]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045645" "DVU_1557 family redox protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DVU_1557-like", "short" "DVU_1557-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 144, "taxa" 766, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 554, "sets" 0, "proteins" 554, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 435}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054656", :literature {"PUB00154723" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Aklujkar M" "Leang C" "Shrestha PM" "Shrestha M" "Lovley DR."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-12712-w", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Transcriptomic profiles of Clostridium ljungdahlii during lithotrophic growth with syngas or H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> compared to organotrophic growth with fructose.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "13135", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29030620}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054656", "name" "DVU_1557-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
