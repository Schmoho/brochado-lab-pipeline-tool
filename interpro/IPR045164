{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNPC3 serves as a bridging factor between the U11 and U12 snRNPs. It contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), connected by a linker that includes a proline-rich region. It binds to the U11-associated 59K protein via its RRM1 and employs the RRM2 to bind hairpin III of the U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). The proline-rich region might be involved in protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00082767], [cite:PUB00082764]]. RBM41 contains only one RRM. Its biological function remains unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6f4j", "name" "Crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster SNF/U2A' complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16105" "RNA-BINDING REGION-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding region-containing protein RBM41/RNPC3", "short" "RBM41/RNPC3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 94, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1684, "taxa" 6051, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4281, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4281, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2839}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045164", :literature {"PUB00082764" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Will CL" "Schneider C" "Hossbach M" "Urlaub H" "Rauhut R" "Elbashir S" "Tuschl T" "Luhrmann R."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1261/rna.7320604", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "The human 18S U11/U12 snRNP contains a set of novel proteins not found in the U2-dependent spliceosome.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "929-41", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15146077}, "PUB00082767" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Benecke H" "Luhrmann R" "Will CL."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600765", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The U11/U12 snRNP 65K protein acts as a molecular bridge, binding the U12 snRNA and U11-59K protein.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3057-69", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16096647}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045164", "name" "RNA-binding region-containing protein RBM41/RNPC3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
