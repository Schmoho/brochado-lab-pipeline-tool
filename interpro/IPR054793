Like many other LysR family proteins, AlsR is transcribed divergently from the alsSD operon [[cite:PUB00086916], [cite:PUB00154713]]. The alsS gene encodes acetolactate synthase, an enzyme involved in the production of acetoin in cells of stationary-phase. AlsS catalyses the conversion of two pyruvate molecules to acetolactate and carbon dioxide. Acetolactate is then converted to acetoin at low pH by acetolactate decarboxylase which encoded by the alsD gene. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms grown on glucose or other fermentable carbon sources [[cite:PUB00086917]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045775" "acetoin biosynthesis transcriptional regulator AlsR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator AlsR", "short" "AlsR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 238, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 291, "sets" 0, "proteins" 291, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 173}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054793", :literature {"PUB00086916" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Renna MC" "Najimudin N" "Winik LR" "Zahler SA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
