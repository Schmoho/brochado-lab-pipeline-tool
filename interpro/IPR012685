{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family form a distinct clade within a larger family of proteins that also includes coenzyme F390 synthetase, an enzyme known in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and a few other methanogenic archaea. The enzyme adenylates coenzyme F420 to F390, a reversible process, during oxygen stress. Other informative homologies include domains of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases involved in activation by adenylation. This family is likely to be an adenylate-forming enzyme related to but distinct from coenzyme F390 synthetase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02304" "F390 synthetase-related protein, TIGR02304 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP02304, F390 synthetase-related", "short" "CHP02304_F390_synth-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 252, "taxa" 1814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1438, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1438, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1111}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012685", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012685", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP02304, F390 synthetase-related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
