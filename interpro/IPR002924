{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of adenovirus E1B 19kDa protein or small t-antigen. The E1B 19kDa protein inhibits E1A induced apoptosis and hence prolongs the viability of the host cell [[cite:PUB00003510]]. It can also inhibit apoptosis mediated by tumour necrosis factor alpha and Fas antigen [[cite:PUB00003510]]. E1B 19kDa blocks apoptosis by interacting with and inhibiting the p53-inducible and death-promoting Bax protein [[cite:PUB00001927]]. The E1B region of adenovirus encodes two proteins E1B 19kDa the small t-antigen as found in this family and E1B 55kDa the large t-antigen which is not found in this family; both of these proteins inhibit E1A induced apoptosis [[cite:PUB00003510]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01691" "Adenovirus E1B 19K protein / small t-antigen"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus small t-antigen, E1B 19kDa protein", "short" "Adenovir_t-Ag_E1B_19kDa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 40, "taxa" 240, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 366, "sets" 0, "proteins" 366, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002924", :literature {"PUB00003510" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Chiou SK" "Tseng CC" "Rao L" "White E."], "ISO_journal" "J.
