{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The sequence of this family is highly conserved and carries a nuclear export signal from residues 31-55, and RNA binding/nuclear localisation signals of RRDR at residue 76 and KRRRK at residue 159. Rev is an essential regulatory protein required for nucleocytoplasmic transport of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs that encode structural proteins. Rev has been shown to down-regulate the expression of viral late genes and alter sensitivity to Gag-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes (CTL). Equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) exhibits a high rate of genetic variation in vivo, and results in a clinically variable disease in infected horses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11129" "Rev protein of equine infectious anaemia virus"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rev protein of equine infectious anaemia virus", "short" "EIAV_Rev"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 14, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 376, "sets" 0, "proteins" 376, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021311", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021311", "name" "Rev protein of equine infectious anaemia virus", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
