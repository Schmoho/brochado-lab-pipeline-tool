{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aurora kinase was discovered by Glover and colleagues in a screen for genes required to maintain the centrosome cycle in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00073353]]. Its yeast homologue Ipl1 (also known as spindle assembly checkpoint kinase) was found to regulate chromosome segregation [[cite:PUB00073357]]. Subsequently, three mammal Aurora kinases, Aurora A, B and C, have been identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are highly conserved serine/threonine kinases that regulate chromosomal alignment and segregation during mitosis and meiosis [[cite:PUB00073360]]. They all contain a protein kinase domain and a destruction box (D-box) recognised by the multi-subunit E3-ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which mediates their proteasomal degradation. However, their N-terminal domains share little sequence identity and confer unique protein-protein interaction abilities among the Aurora kinases [[cite:PUB00073329]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5orl", "name" "Crystal structure of Aurora-A kinase in complex with an allosterically binding fragment"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24350" "SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE IAL-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aurora kinase-like", "short" "Aur-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 214, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2875, "taxa" 10451, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18469, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18469, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11816}, "pathways" 81}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
