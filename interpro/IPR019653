{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The RegB endoribonuclease encoded by Bacteriophage T4 is a unique sequence-specific nuclease that cleaves in the middle of GGAG or, in a few cases, GGAU tetranucleotides, preferentially those found in the Shine-Dalgarno regions of early phage mRNAs. T4 regB expression is regulated autogenously by attacking its own mRNA. The deduced primary structure of RegB proteins in many phages is almost identical to that of T4, while the sequences of RegB encoded by Enterobacteria phage RB69, Enterobacteria phage TuIa and Enterobacteria phage RB49 show substantial divergence from their T4 counterpart [[cite:PUB00045094]]. In RB49 regB expression is regulated by both RegB and Escherichia coli endoribonuclease E.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's worth noting that this family does not fall into the Lysozyme-like family, but rather is a new member of the RelE/YoeB structural and functional family of ribonucleases specialising in mRNA inactivation within the ribosome [[cite:PUB00041534]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10715" "T4-page Endoribonuclease RegB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T4 endoribonuclease RegB", "short" "T4_endoribonuclease_RegB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 39, "taxa" 770, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 552, "sets" 0, "proteins" 552, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019653", :literature {"PUB00045094" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Piesiniene L" "Truncaite L" "Zajanckauskaite A" "Nivinskas R."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh892", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The sequences and activities of RegB endoribonucleases of T4-related bacteriophages.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "5582-95", "volume" "32", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15486207}, "PUB00041534" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Odaert B" "Saida F" "Aliprandi P" "Durand S" "Crechet JB" "Guerois R" "Laalami S" "Uzan M" "Bontems F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
