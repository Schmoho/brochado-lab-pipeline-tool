{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a distinctive clade, in which all characterised members are FMN-binding, within the larger family of luciferase-like monooxygenases (LLM), among which there are both FMN- and F420-binding enzymes. A well-characterised member is Nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase, component A from Aminobacter aminovorans, where nitrilotriacetate is a chelating agent used in detergents. This protein family also includes Dimethyl-sulfide monooxygenase from Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans, Dibenzothiophene desulfurization enzyme A from Rhodococcus sp. and Long-chain alkane monooxygenase from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans [[cite:PUB00050560], [cite:PUB00100344]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7e36", "name" "A [6+4]-cycloaddition adduct is the biosynthetic intermediate in streptoseomycin biosynthesis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03860" "NtaA/DmoA family FMN-dependent monooxygenase"}, "cdd" {"cd01095" "Nitrilotriacetate_monoxgenase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000337" "Nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase component A/pristinamycin IIA synthase subunit A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase component A/pristinamycin IIA synthase subunit A", "short" "NTA_MOA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3124, "taxa" 11608, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35012, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33422, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25322}, "pathways" 215}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
