{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Initiation of programmed cell death in C.elegans occurs by the binding of EGL-1 to CED-9 which disrupts a complex involving CED-4/CED-9 and allows CED-4 to activate CED-3, a caspase.

The formation of the complex induces structural rearrangements in CED-9 and EGL-1 adopts an extended Î±-helical conformation [[cite:PUB00031609]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11430" "Programmed cell death activator EGL-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Programmed cell death activator EGL-1", "short" "EGL-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 29, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021543", :literature {"PUB00031609" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Yan N" "Gu L" "Kokel D" "Chai J" "Li W" "Han A" "Chen L" "Xue D" "Shi Y."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
