{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>FKBP3, also known as FKBP25, contains the N-terminal basic tilted helix bundle (BTHB) domain and the C-terminal PPIase domain. It is a nuclear prolyl isomerase that interacts directly with nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00093879]]. It interacts with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 as well as with their transcriptional regulator Yin Yang 1 (YY1) [[cite:PUB00093877]]. It is also a microtubule-associated protein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm and stabilizes the microtubule network by direct binding of the C-terminal PPIase domain [[cite:PUB00093875]]. It plays a role in the proliferation of non-small cell type lung cancer cells (NSCLC) by modulating Sp1/HDAC2/p27 [[cite:PUB00093878]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3kz7", "name" "C-terminal domain of Murine FKBP25 rapamycin complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046357", "name" "Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46493" "PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE FKBP3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP3", "short" "FKBP3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 694, "taxa" 2437, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1110, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 740}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
