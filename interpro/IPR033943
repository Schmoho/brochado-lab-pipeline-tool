{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ba3-like heme-copper oxidase subunit I.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The ba3 (Type B) family of heme-copper oxidases are transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chains of prokaryotes and some archaea which catalyze the reduction of O<sub>2</sub>and simultaneously pump protons across the membrane.  It has been proposed that archaea acquired heme-copper oxidases through gene transfer from Gram-positive bacteria.  The ba3 family contains oxidases that lack the conserved residues that form the D- and K-pathways in CcO and ubiquinol oxidase. Instead they contain a potential alternative K-pathway.  Additional proton channels have been proposed for this family of oxidases but none have been identified definitively [[cite:PUB00081800]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3s8g", "name" "1.8 A structure of ba3 cytochrome c oxidase mutant (A120F) from Thermus thermophilus in lipid environment"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036927", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase-like, subunit I superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01660" "ba3-like_Oxidase_I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ba3-like heme-copper oxidase subunit I", "short" "Ba3-like_Oxidase_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 41, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 445, "taxa" 1762, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1458, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1458, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1223}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
