{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family belong to the family of bacterial sugar transferases ([interpro:IPR003362]). Nearly all are found in species that encode the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system XrtA predicted to act in protein sorting in a number of Gram-negative bacteria (notable exceptions appear to include Magnetococcus sp. (strain MC-1) and Myxococcus xanthus (strain DK 1622)). These genes are generally found near one or more of the PrsK, PrsR or PrsT genes that have been related to the PEP-CTERM system by phylogenetic profiling methods. The nature of the sugar transferase reaction catalysed by members of this clade is unknown and may conceivably be variable with respect to substrate by species. These proteins are homologues of the EpsB protein found in Methylobacillus sp. 12S [[cite:PUB00021014]], which is also associated with a PEP-CTERM system, but of a distinct type. A name which appears attached to a number of genes (by transitive annotation) in this family is \"undecaprenyl-phosphate galactose phosphotransferase\", which comes from relatively distant characterised enterobacterial homologues, and is considerably more specific than warranted from the currently available evidence.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03013" "TIGR03013 family XrtA/PEP-CTERM system glycosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sugar transferase, PEP-CTERM system associated", "short" "Sugar_tfrase_EpsB_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 833, "taxa" 2941, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2909, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2909, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2281}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0652", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0652"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017464", :literature {"PUB00021014" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 2", "authors" ["Yoshida T" "Ayabe Y" "Yasunaga M" "Usami Y" "Habe H" "Nojiri H" "Omori T."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.25913-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Genes involved in the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide methanolan by the obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus sp strain 12S.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "431-44", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12624205}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017475", "name" "Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis polyprenyl glycosylphosphotransferase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017464", "name" "Sugar transferase, PEP-CTERM system associated", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017472", "name" "Undecaprenyl-phosphate galactose phosphotransferase, WbaP", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017473", "name" "Undecaprenyl-phosphate glucose phosphotransferase, WcaJ", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
