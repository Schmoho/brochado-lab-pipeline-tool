{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial proteins, including the outer membrane lipoprotein Flpp3 from Francisella tularensis ([swissprot:Q5NF33]). This protein family was previously known as DUF3568. Flpp3, a virulence determinant of tularemia, shows a six stranded β-sheet supported with two crossing α-helices. It has a hydrophobic internal cavity that has been suggested to bind a small organic molecule. However, its specific function is still unknown [[cite:PUB00100865], [cite:PUB00100866]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6pny", "name" "X-ray Structure of Flpp3"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12092" "Protein of unknown function (DUF3568)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipoprotein Flpp3-like", "short" "Flpp3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 105, "taxa" 909, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1246, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 897}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021952", :literature {"PUB00100865" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zook J" "Mo G" "Sisco NJ" "Craciunescu FM" "Hansen DT" "Baravati B" "Cherry BR" "Sykes K" "Wachter R" "Van Horn WD" "Fromme P."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "NMR Structure of Francisella tularensis Virulence Determinant Reveals Structural Homology to Bet v1 Allergen Proteins.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1116-22", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26004443}, "PUB00100866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zook J" "Shekhar M" "Hansen D" "Conrad C" "Grant T" "Gupta C" "White T" "Barty A" "Basu S" "Zhao Y" "Zatsepin N" "Ishchenko A" "Batyuk A" "Gati C" "Li C" "Galli L" "Coe J" "Hunter M" "Liang M" "Weierstall U" "Nelson G" "James D" "Stauch B" "Craciunescu F" "Thifault D" "Liu W" "Cherezov V" "Singharoy A" "Fromme P."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "XFEL and NMR Structures of Francisella Lipoprotein Reveal Conformational Space of Drug Target against Tularemia.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "540-547.e3", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32142641}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021952", "name" "Lipoprotein Flpp3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 12, "alignment:full" 136}}}
