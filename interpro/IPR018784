{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of LLP homolog (LLPH) animal proteins, including 18 kDa learning-associated protein of slug from Lehmannia marginata (LAPS18), which functions in the regulation of neuronal cell adhesion and/or movement and synapse attachment [[cite:PUB00044326]]. It has been shown to bind to the ApC/EBP (Aplysia CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) promoter and activate the transcription of ApC/EBP mRNA [[cite:PUB00044327]]. In mice hippocampal neurons, regulates dendritic and spine growth and synaptic transmission [[cite:PUB00101115]]. In humans, LLPH plays a role in the ribosome biogenesis as one of the pre-60S assembly factors [[cite:PUB00101554]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34253" "PROTEIN LLP HOMOLOG"}, "pfam" {"PF10169" "LLP homolog"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LLP homolog-like", "short" "LLPH-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 33, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 878, "taxa" 3601, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1367, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1354, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 954}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018784", :literature {"PUB00044326" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Nakaya T" "Kawahara S" "Watanabe S" "Lee D" "Suzuki T" "Kirino Y."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.2001.00397.x", "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Identification and expression of a novel gene in odour-taste associative learning in the terrestrial slug.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "43-56", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11168596}, "PUB00044327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kim H" "Lee SH" "Han JH" "Lee JA" "Cheang YH" "Chang DJ" "Lee YS" "Kaang BK."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.01.035", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "A nucleolar protein ApLLP induces ApC/EBP expression required for long-term synaptic facilitation in aplysia neurons.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "707-18", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16504946}, "PUB00101115" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yu NK" "Kim HF" "Shim J" "Kim S" "Kim DW" "Kwak C" "Sim SE" "Choi JH" "Ahn S" "Yoo J" "Choi SL" "Jang DJ" "Lim CS" "Lee YS" "Kang C" "Choi SY" "Kaang BK."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "A transducible nuclear/nucleolar protein, mLLP, regulates neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "22892", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26961175}, "PUB00101554" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Liang X" "Zuo MQ" "Zhang Y" "Li N" "Ma C" "Dong MQ" "Gao N."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structural snapshots of human pre-60S ribosomal particles before and after nuclear export.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "3542", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32669547}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018784", "name" "LLP homolog-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 31, "alignment:full" 927}}}
