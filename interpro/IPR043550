{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EHMT1 and Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EHMT2 ([ec:2.1.1.367]). EHMT1 and EHMT2 mono- and dimethylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3 (H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, respectively) in euchromatin [[cite:PUB00088110]]. H3K9me is a specific tag for repression of epigenetic transcription, recruiting HP1 proteins to methylated histones. EHMT1 also methylates 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me), but weakly [[cite:PUB00088110]], while EHMT2 also monomethylates 'Lys-56' of histone H3 (H3K56me1) during the G1 phase of the cell cycle [[cite:PUB00088111]], and methylates 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me) [[cite:PUB00088110]]. EHMT1 and EHMT2 also dimethylate other proteins, including 'Lys-373' of p53 [[cite:PUB00088113], [cite:PUB00088112]].</p>\n\n<p>EHMT1 forms a heterodimer with EHMT2 [[cite:PUB00088114]], and is a component of the E2F6.com-1 complex in G0 phase [[cite:PUB00087886]]. EHMT1 and EHMT2 contain ankyrin repeats (eight and seven ankyrin repeats, respectively), which bind the monomethylated RELA subunit of NF-kappa-B, a SET domain which interacts with WIZ [[cite:PUB00088114]], and a pre-SET domain that binds three zinc ions via cysteine residues [[cite:PUB00050535]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2rfi", "name" "Crystal structure of catalytic domain of human euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 in complex with SAH and dimethylated H3K9 peptide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46307" "G9A, ISOFORM B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EHMT1/EHMT2", "short" "EHMT1/EHMT2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 47, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 943, "taxa" 4036, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5077, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5077, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2422}, "pathways" 158}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
