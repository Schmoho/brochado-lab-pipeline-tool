{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arl2 (Arf-like 2) GTPases are members of the Arf family that bind GDP and GTP with very low affinity. Unlike most Arf family proteins, Arl2 is not myristoylated at its N-terminal helix. The protein PDE-delta, first identified in photoreceptor rod cells, binds specifically to Arl2 and is structurally very similar to RhoGDI. Despite the high structural similarity between Arl2 and Rho proteins and between PDE-delta and RhoGDI, the interactions between the GTPases and their effectors are very different. In its GTP bound form, Arl2 interacts with the protein Binder of Arl2 (BART), and the complex is believed to play a role in mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transport [[cite:PUB00053517]]. In its GDP bound form, Arl2 interacts with tubulin- folding Cofactor D; this interaction is believed to play a role in regulation of microtubule dynamics that impact the cytoskeleton, cell division, and cytokinesis [[cite:PUB00010143]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes Alp41 from fission yeasts which is essential for the cofactor-dependent biogenesis of microtubules [[cite:PUB00096539]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ksh", "name" "Complex of Arl2 and PDE delta, Crystal Form 2 (native)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04154" "Arf-like 2 (Arl2) GTPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2", "short" "Arl2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1613, "taxa" 6102, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2511, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2511, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1557}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045873", :literature {"PUB00010143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bhamidipati A" "Lewis SA" "Cowan NJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
