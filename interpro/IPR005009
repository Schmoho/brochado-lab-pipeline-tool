V. virus mRNA capping enzyme is a multifunctional protein with RNA triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, RNA (guanine-7) methyltransferase, and transcription termination factor activities. The protein is a heterodimer of 95kDa and 33kDa subunits encoded by the v.virus D1 and D12 genes, respectively.
