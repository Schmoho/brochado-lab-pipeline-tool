{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes HtrL (also known as YibB) in Escherichia coli, where its gene is found in a region of LPS core biosynthesis genes [[cite:PUB00015305]]. Homologues are found in Shigella flexneri, Campylobacter jejuni, and some eukaryotic species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. WlaTC from Campylobacter jejuni, is involved in lipooligosaccharide synthesis (LOS) together with WlaRG, and WlaTB. WlaTC showed great similarity to HtrL and it has been described as the glycosyltransferase [[cite:PUB00102307]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09612" "Bacterial protein of unknown function (HtrL_YibB)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02192" "protein YibB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WlaTC/HtrL glycosyltransferase", "short" "WlaTC/HtrL_glycosyltransf"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 190, "taxa" 1202, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1257, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1242, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 828}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011735", :literature {"PUB00015305" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Sirisena DM" "MacLachlan PR" "Liu SL" "Hessel A" "Sanderson KE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
