{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the Acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase (AcpH, also called ACP hydrolyase) from Escherichia coli. Proteins in this entry are restricted to the gammaproteobacteria. AcpH converts holo-ACP to apo-ACP by hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group from ACP [[cite:PUB00044655], [cite:PUB00062378]].</p>\r\n<p>A mutant E. coli strain having a total deletion of the acpH grows normally, showing that phosphodiesterase activity is not essential for growth, although it is required for turnover of the ACP prosthetic group in vivo. AcpH is found only in Gram-negative organisms suggesting that it plays a role in some aspect of lipid metabolism that is unique to these organisms. The most obvious of which is biosynthesis of lipid A. Because AcpH is a hydrolase, it could possibly be an editing enzyme that intercepts acyl-ACPs that would give an inappropriate lipid A structure if used as acyl donors [[cite:PUB00044655]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01950" "Acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase [acpH]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase, gammaproteobacteria", "short" "ACP_phosphodiesterase_gpbac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 47, "taxa" 834, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 919, "sets" 0, "proteins" 919, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 689}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
