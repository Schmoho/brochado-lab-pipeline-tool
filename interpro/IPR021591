{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is predominantly found in Saccharomycetales, including YNR034W-A (also known as EGO4) and YCR075W-A (EGO2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. EGO2 is a component of the yeast EGO complex (EGOC), which is responsible for the amino acid-dependent activation of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a central controller of cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and differentiation in response to environmental cues. EGO2 adopts a Roadblock domain fold that consists of a central core β-sheet of five anti-parallel β-strands flanked by a long α-helix on the bottom side. EGO4 shows a similar αββαββ configuration. It interacts with the GTPase Gtr2, but its specific function remains unknown [[cite:PUB00100979], [cite:PUB00100978]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035098", "name" "YNR034W-A/EGO2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11503" "YNR034W-A-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YNR034W-A/EGO2", "short" "YNR034W-A/EGO2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 125, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 84, "sets" 0, "proteins" 84, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 70}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021591", :literature {"PUB00100979" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Powis K" "Zhang T" "Panchaud N" "Wang R" "De Virgilio C" "Ding J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "Crystal structure of the Ego1-Ego2-Ego3 complex and its role in promoting Rag GTPase-dependent TORC1 signaling.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1043-59", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26206314}, "PUB00100978" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Zhang T" "Peli-Gulli MP" "Zhang Z" "Tang X" "Ye J" "De Virgilio C" "Ding J."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Structural insights into the EGO-TC-mediated membrane tethering of the TORC1-regulatory Rag GTPases.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "eaax8164", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31579828}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021591", "name" "YNR034W-A/EGO2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 37}}}
