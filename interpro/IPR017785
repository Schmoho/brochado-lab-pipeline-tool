{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of known and predicted choline-sulphatase enzymes involved in the synthesis of glycine betaine from choline [[cite:PUB00013493], [cite:PUB00042951]]. The symbiotic soil bacterium Rhizobium meliloti can synthesise glycine betaine from choline-O-sulphate and choline to protect itself from osmotic stress [[cite:PUB00042951], [cite:PUB00044122]]. Glycine betaine biosynthesis is not, however, crucial for nodulation and nitrogen fixation. This biosynthetic pathway is encoded by the betICBA locus, which comprises a regulatory gene, betI, and three structural genes, betC (choline sulphatase), betB (betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase), and betA (choline dehydrogenase). betICBA genes constitute a single operon, despite the existence of intergenic regions that contain mosaic elements between betI and betC, and between betB and betA [[cite:PUB00044122]]. betC lies adjacent to an ATP-binding cassette transporter and a LysR type regulator, but well away from betBA, in this species [[cite:PUB00044123]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6g60", "name" "Choline sulfatase from Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti cocrystalized with choline"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16032" "choline-sulfatase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03417" "choline-sulfatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Choline-sulfatase", "short" "Choline-sulfatase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1449, "taxa" 5171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4668, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4668, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3534}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0749", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0749"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
