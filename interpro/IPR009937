{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phage_holin_3_6 is a family of small hydrophobic proteins with two or three transmembrane domains of the Hol-X family. Holin proteins are produced by double-stranded DNA bacteriophages that use an endolysin-holin strategy to achieve lysis of their hosts. The endolysins are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that are usually accumulated in the cytosol until access to the cell wall substrate is provided by the holin membrane lesion.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07332" "Putative Actinobacterial Holin-X, holin superfamily III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative Actinobacterial Holin-X, holin superfamily III", "short" "Phage_holin_3_6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 4080, "taxa" 14899, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19869, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15693}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009937", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009937", "name" "Putative Actinobacterial Holin-X, holin superfamily III", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 229, "alignment:full" 5905}}}
