{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include the proteins gp6 and gp15 from bacteriophage HK97 and SPP1, respectively [[cite:PUB00067867], [cite:PUB00048313]]. They are critical in the assembly of the connector, a specialised structure that serves as an interface for head and tail attachment, as well as a point at which DNA exits the head during infection by the bacteriophage. They form dodecameric ring structures that comprise the middle ring of the connector, located between the portal protein (attached to the head) and the gp7/gp16 ring (attached to the tail). They are components of the mature phage and the absence or mutation of HK97 gp6 or SPP1 gp15, respectively, result in defective head-tail joining and the absence of mature phage particles. The genome maps of HK97 and SPP1 show that genes encoding gp6 and gp15 are in the same relative position on the genome, located adjacent to the major capsid protein (MCP) gene and in between head and tail genes [[cite:PUB00067867], [cite:PUB00048313]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes proteobacterial prophages.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08051" "Head-Tail Connector Proteins gp6 and gp15, and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Head-tail connector protein gp6/gp15-like", "short" "Gp6_gp15-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 79, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39, "sets" 0, "proteins" 39, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047186", :literature {"PUB00048313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Lhuillier S" "Gallopin M" "Gilquin B" "Brasiles S" "Lancelot N" "Letellier G" "Gilles M" "Dethan G" "Orlova EV" "Couprie J" "Tavares P" "Zinn-Justin S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
