{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from actinomycetes, including A-factor receptor protein from Streptomyces griseus (ArpA) [swissprot:Q9ZN78]. ArpA represses the adpA expression by binding to its promoter region in the absence of A-factor, causing repression of streptomycin production and of sporulation [[cite:PUB00151209]]. Members of this protein family have a TetR-type  DNA-binding HTH domain ([interpro:IPR001647]) at its N-terminal end and at the C terminus, a domain typical for the TetR transcription regulators superfamily ([interpro:IPR036271]). These proteins are involved in the regulation of antibiotic production and other physiological responses [[cite:PUB00106236], [cite:PUB00106235], [cite:PUB00106233], [cite:PUB00106234]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6srn", "name" "Structural basis for control of antibiotic production by bacterial hormones"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036271", "name" "Tetracyclin repressor-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041196" "ScbR family autoregulator-binding transcription factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "A-factor receptor protein-like", "short" "ArpA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 549, "taxa" 1806, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4181, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3034}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047923", :literature {"PUB00106233" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Bhukya H" "Bhujbalrao R" "Bitra A" "Anand R."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Structural and functional basis of transcriptional regulation by TetR family protein CprB from S. coelicolor A3(2).", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "10122-33", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25092919}, "PUB00106234" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Li X" "Wang J" "Shi M" "Wang W" "Corre C" "Yang K."], "ISO_journal" "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "title" "Evidence for the formation of ScbR/ScbR2 heterodimers and identification of one of the regulatory targets in Streptomyces coelicolor.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "5333-5340", "volume" "101", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28439624}, "PUB00106235" {"URL" nil, "issue" "37", "authors" ["Ray S" "Maitra A" "Biswas A" "Panjikar S" "Mondal J" "Anand R."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Functional insights into the mode of DNA and ligand binding of the TetR family regulator TylP from <i>Streptomyces fradiae</i>.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "15301-15311", "volume" "292", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28739805}, "PUB00106236" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhu J" "Chen Z" "Li J" "Wen Y."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "AvaR1, a Butenolide-Type Autoregulator Receptor in <i>Streptomyces avermitilis</i>, Directly Represses Avenolide and Avermectin Biosynthesis and Multiple Physiological Responses.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "2577", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29312254}, "PUB00151209" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Miyake K" "Kuzuyama T" "Horinouchi S" "Beppu T."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "The A-factor-binding protein of Streptomyces griseus negatively controls streptomycin production and sporulation.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "3003-8", "volume" "172", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2111804}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR050109", "name" "HTH-type, TetR-like transcriptional regulator", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003012", "name" "Tetracycline transcriptional regulator, TetR", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017757", "name" "Transcriptional repressor BetI", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR019915", "name" "Transcription regulator, pyrimidine utilisation, RutR", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023851", "name" "Transcriptional regulator, TetR-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047923", "name" "A-factor receptor protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
