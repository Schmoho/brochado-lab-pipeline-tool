{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) constitute an abundant family of nucleic acid binding proteins in the genomes of higher and lower eukaryotes. This entry represents a group of plant ZFPs, including ZFP3, KNUCKLES and LATE FLOWERING from Arabidopsis. ZFP3 is a putative transcriptional regulator negatively regulating ABA suppression of seed germination in Arabidopsis. Together with other ZFPs, it regulates light and ABA responses during germination and early seedling development [[cite:PUB00095543], [cite:PUB00095544]]. KNUCKLES plays an important role in the termination of floral meristem activity [[cite:PUB00101398]] and LATE FLOWERING controls the transition to flowering [[cite:PUB00098560]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47287" "C2H2 AND C2HC ZINC FINGERS SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger protein 3-like", "short" "ZFP3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 240, "taxa" 932, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4005, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4005, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2337}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044246", :literature {"PUB00101398" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kwasniewska K" "Breathnach C" "Fitzsimons C" "Goslin K" "Thomson B" "Beegan J" "Finocchio A" "Prunet N" "O'Maoileidigh DS" "Wellmer F."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "Expression of <i>KNUCKLES</i> in the Stem Cell Domain Is Required for Its Function in the Control of Floral Meristem Activity in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "704351", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34367223}, "PUB00098560" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Weingartner M" "Subert C" "Sauer N."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "LATE, a C(2)H(2) zinc-finger protein that acts as floral repressor.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "681-92", "volume" "68", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21771123}, "PUB00095543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Joseph MP" "Papdi C" "Kozma-Bognar L" "Nagy I" "Lopez-Carbonell M" "Rigo G" "Koncz C" "Szabados L."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "The Arabidopsis ZINC FINGER PROTEIN3 Interferes with Abscisic Acid and Light Signaling in Seed Germination and Plant Development.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1203-1220", "volume" "165", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24808098}, "PUB00095544" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Englbrecht CC" "Schoof H" "Bohm S."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Genomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Genomics", "title" "Conservation, diversification and expansion of C2H2 zinc finger proteins in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "39", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15236668}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009788", "name" "negative regulation of abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044246", "name" "Zinc finger protein 3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
