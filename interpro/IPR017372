{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its related factors neurturin (NTN), artemin (ART) and persephin (PSP), are members of the GDNF family of neurotrophic factors. They form a sub-group in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. These factors are involved in the promotion of neurone survival, exerting their effects through specific receptors.</p>\n\n<p>The GDNF family receptors (GFRs) are glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked, cell surface receptors [[cite:PUB00009432]]. Four receptor subtypes, termed GFRalpha-1 to 4, are currently recognised. GFRalpha-1 and 2 are activated by GDNF and NTN respectively, although some degree of ligand promiscuity is thought to occur [[cite:PUB00009433]]. Homologues for these receptor subtypes have been cloned from mammalian and avian tissue. The principal ligand for GFRalpha-3 is artemin. This receptor subtype is currently described only in mammals [[cite:PUB00009434]]. GFRalpha-4 is activated by persephin and has so far only been found in chicken [[cite:PUB00009435]]. This entry is general for types 1 to 3.</p>\n\n<p>Activation of GFR family members triggers their interaction with the membrane-bound receptor kinase Ret. This induces Ret homo-dimerisation, triggering a cascade of intracellular signalling events such as the activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma) dependent pathways [[cite:PUB00009432]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038071" "GDNF family receptor alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor, alpha 1/2", "short" "Glial_neurotroph_fac_rcpt_a1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 526, "taxa" 1856, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1636, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1573, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1045}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017372", :literature {"PUB00009432" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Airaksinen MS" "Titievsky A" "Saarma M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
