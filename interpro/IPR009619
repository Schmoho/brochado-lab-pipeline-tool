{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CrgA is a transmembrane (TM) protein,  first described in Streptomyces as being required for sporulation through the coordination of several aspects of reproductive growth. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CrgA is a central component of the divisome, and consists of 93 residues with two predicted TM helices  (TM1: residues 29-51 and TM2: residues 66-88). CrgA facilitates the recruitment of the proteins essential for peptidoglycan synthesis to the divisome and also stabilizes the divisome. Reduced production of CrgA results in elongated cells and reduced growth rate, and loss of CrgA impairs peptidoglycan synthesis. CrgA has homologs in other actinomycetes [[cite:PUB00081940]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00631" "Cell division protein CrgA [crgA]"}, "pfam" {"PF06781" "Cell division protein CrgA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein CrgA", "short" "CrgA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 1893, "taxa" 5445, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5569, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5475, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4298}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009619", :literature {"PUB00081940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Das N" "Dai J" "Hung I" "Rajagopalan MR" "Rajagopalan MR" "Zhou HX" "Cross TA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
