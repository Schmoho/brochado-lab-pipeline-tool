{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gasdermin-E, also known as DFNA5, is involved in the p53-regulated cellular response to response to DNA damage probably by cooperating with p53 [[cite:PUB00092919]]. It can be cleaved by CASP3 into two parts: GSDME-N and GSDME-C. The GSDME-N fragment can perforate membranes and thereby induce pyroptosis [[cite:PUB00088060]]. Purified GSDME-N has been shown to efficiently lyse phosphoinositide/cardiolipin-containing liposomes and form pores on membranes made of artificial or natural phospholipid mixtures [[cite:PUB00088058]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Pejvakin, a gasdermin family member. It is a peroxisome-associated protein required to protect auditory hair cells against noise-induced damage [[cite:PUB00101502]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8jyv", "name" "Crystal structure of the gasdermin from Trichoplax adhaerens"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15207" "NONSYNDROMIC HEARING IMPAIRMENT PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gasdermin-E", "short" "GSDME"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 677, "taxa" 2357, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2142, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2142, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1456}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042377", :literature {"PUB00101502" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Defourny J" "Aghaie A" "Perfettini I" "Avan P" "Delmaghani S" "Petit C."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Pejvakin-mediated pexophagy protects auditory hair cells against noise-induced damage.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "8010-8017", "volume" "116", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30936319}, "PUB00088060" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7661", "authors" ["Wang Y" "Gao W" "Shi X" "Ding J" "Liu W" "He H" "Wang K" "Shao F."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22393", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "99-103", "volume" "547", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28459430}, "PUB00092919" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Masuda Y" "Futamura M" "Kamino H" "Nakamura Y" "Kitamura N" "Ohnishi S" "Miyamoto Y" "Ichikawa H" "Ohta T" "Ohki M" "Kiyono T" "Egami H" "Baba H" "Arakawa H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
