{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Clostridial species are one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastro-intestinal illnesses. They are Gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur naturally in the soil [[cite:PUB00007586]]. Among the family are: Clostridium botulinum, which produces one of the most potent toxins in existence; Clostridium tetani, causative agent of tetanus; and Clostridium perfringens, commonly found in wound infections and diarrhoea cases. The use of toxins to damage the host is a method deployed by many bacterial pathogens.</p>\n\n<p>The major virulence factor of C. perfringens is the CPE enterotoxin, which is secreted upon invasion of the host gut, and contributes to food poisoning and other gastrointestinal illnesses [[cite:PUB00007586]]. It has a molecular weight of 35.3kDa, and is responsible for the disintegration of tight junctions between endothelial cells in the gut [[cite:PUB00007587]]. This mechanism is mediated by host claudins-3 and -4, situated at the tight junctions.</p>\n\n<p>Two more host receptors have been characterised and expressed<i>in vivo</i> [[cite:PUB00007588]]. Named CPE-R and RVP1, these may be utilised in the passage of Clostridial species through the gut wall, although the regulatory mechanisms have not been elucidated.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes HA-70 from Clostridium botulinum C phage.
