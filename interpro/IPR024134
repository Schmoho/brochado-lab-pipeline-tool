{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are ubiquitous metalloproteins that prevent damage by oxygen-mediated free radicals by catalysing the dismutation of superoxide into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [[cite:PUB00000151]]. Superoxide is a normal by-product of aerobic respiration and is produced by a number of reactions, including oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis. The dismutase enzymes have a very high catalytic efficiency due to the attraction of superoxide to the ions bound at the active site [[cite:PUB00004789], [cite:PUB00001545]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three forms of superoxide dismutase, depending on the metal cofactor: Cu/Zn (which binds both copper and zinc), Fe and Mn types. The Fe and Mn forms are similar in their primary, secondary and tertiary structures, but are distinct from the Cu/Zn form [[cite:PUB00004722]]. Prokaryotes and protists contain Mn, Fe or both types, while most eukaryotic organisms utilise the Cu/Zn type.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the superoxide dismutase proteins as well as a related family of copper chaperones for superoxide dismutases.
