{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>One mechanism by which bacteriophages effect host lysis begins with the accumulation of a holin in the host membrane and an endolysin in the host cytoplasm during late gene expression. At an allele-specific time, the holin disrupts the membrane, thus allowing the endolysin to enter the periplasm and degrade the cell wall peptidoglycan. This entry represents a specific holin, known as T, which has an unusual C-terminal periplasmic domain thought to be involved in the transduction of environmental information for the real-time control of lysis timing [[cite:PUB00053276]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6px4", "name" "Crystal structure of the complex between periplasmic domains of antiholin RI and holin T from T4 phage, in H32"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04104" "Holin"}, "pfam" {"PF11031" "Bacteriophage T holin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage T4, GpT, holin", "short" "Phage_T4_GpT_holin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 86, "taxa" 1352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 957, "sets" 0, "proteins" 956, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020982", :literature {"PUB00053276" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Tran TA" "Struck DK" "Young R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
