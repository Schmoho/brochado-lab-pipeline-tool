{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents NAD(+) synthetases, including glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetases and NH(3)-dependent NAD(+) synthetases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>NAD+ is involved electron transport and redox reactions and in DNA ligation and protein ADP-ribosylation. In yeast and most other organisms, NAD is generated through the de novo pathway and the salvage pathway. In the de novo pathway, quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). In the salvage pathway, NaMN is generated by recycling of nicotinamide. Both pathways converge on NaMN, which is then converted into deamido-NAD+. Subsequently, deamido-NAD+ is converted to NAD+ by NAD+ synthetase [[cite:PUB00070122]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAD+ synthetase has been extensively studied in bacteria. It is encoded by nadE gene in E. coli and by outB gene in B. subtilis [[cite:PUB00070123]]. These prokaryotic enzymes are ammonia-dependent (containing an ammonia-utilising domain)[[cite:PUB00070124]]. However, some pokaryotic NAD(+) synthetases, such as that from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, contain a nitrilase-related domain, are glutamine-dependent [[cite:PUB00070124]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4f4h", "name" "Crystal structure of a Glutamine dependent NAD+ synthetase from Burkholderia thailandensis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR041856", "name" "Glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00553" "NAD(+) synthase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00552" "NAD(+) synthase"}, "panther" {"PTHR23090" "NH 3 /GLUTAMINE-DEPENDENT NAD + SYNTHETASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD(+) synthetase", "short" "NAD_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 43, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11887, "taxa" 45209, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57845, "sets" 0, "proteins" 56095, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42131}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0057", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0057"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
