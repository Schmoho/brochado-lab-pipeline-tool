{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>General transcription factor 3C polypeptide 4 (GTF3C4, also known as Transcription factor IIIC 90kDa subunit (TFIIIC90) and Sfc9 in yeast) is a subunit of transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC), a multisubunit complex that recognises promoter elements and recruits TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III. This subunit is essential for RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription [[cite:PUB00056254], [cite:PUB00056255]]. It has histone acetyltransferase activity with unique specificity for free and nucleosomal H3 [[cite:PUB00056254]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15496" "GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 3C POLYPEPTIDE 4 FAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "General transcription factor 3C polypeptide 4", "short" "GTF3C4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1738, "taxa" 6115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3194, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1989}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
