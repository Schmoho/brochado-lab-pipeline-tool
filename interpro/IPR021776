{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alternative complex III (ACIII) is a multisubunit quinol:electron acceptor oxidoreductase that couples quinol oxidation with transmembrane proton translocation similar to bc1 complex (or complex III). It is a key component of the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains in many bacteria. It has six subunits (ActA-F), ActD subunit represented in this entry. The transmembrane regions of this subunit is part of the TM arm of the complex [[cite:PUB00099731], [cite:PUB00099732]]. Although the function of this subunit is not clear, it may play a role in stabilizing the TM region of ACIII which contributes to a stable menaquinol binding pocket and proton translocation passage [[cite:PUB00099732]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11821" "Alternative complex III, ActD subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alternative complex III, ActD subunit", "short" "ActD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 1309, "taxa" 5484, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7622, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7618, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5668}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021776", :literature {"PUB00099732" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Shi Y" "Xin Y" "Wang C" "Blankenship RE" "Sun F" "Xu X."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "Cryo-EM structures of the air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced photosynthetic alternative complex III from <i>Roseiflexus castenholzii</i>.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "eaba2739", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32832681}, "PUB00099731" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7703", "authors" ["Sun C" "Benlekbir S" "Venkatakrishnan P" "Wang Y" "Hong S" "Hosler J" "Tajkhorshid E" "Rubinstein JL" "Gennis RB."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of the alternative complex III in a supercomplex with cytochrome oxidase.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "123-126", "volume" "557", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29695868}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021776", "name" "Alternative complex III, ActD subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 77, "alignment:full" 1376}}}
