{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase, also known as Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase ([ec:2.3.1.97]) (Nmt), is the enzyme responsible for transferring a myristate group on the N-terminal glycine of a number of cellular eukaryotics and viral proteins [[cite:PUB00000005]]. Nmt is a monomeric protein of about 50 to 60kDa whose sequence appears to be well conserved.
