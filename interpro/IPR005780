This transferase (encoded by subunit A) is involved in the transfer of 'methyl' group from N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M. In an accompanying reaction, methane is produced by two-electron reduction of methyl-coenzyme M by another enzyme, methyl-coenzyme M reductase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01098" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase subunit E [mtrE]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016509" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, subunit E"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01113" "tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase subunit E"}, "pfam" {"PF04206" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, subunit E"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, subunit E", "short" "MeTrfase_E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 62, "taxa" 506, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 479, "sets" 0, "proteins" 479, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 420}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0722"} {"accession" "GenProp0288", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0288"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
