{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry, previously known as DUF2796, represents the zinc-specific solute binding protein ZrgA homologues found predominantly in gammaproteobacteria. ZrgA is an important component of the zrgABCDE operon in Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio cholerae. It is anticipated to function as a solute binding protein (SBP) for the ZrgBC permease/ATPase transporter system as it is required for a normal growth and survival in zinc-deficient conditions [[cite:PUB00159002], [cite:PUB00159005]].</p>\n\n<p>The wild type ZrgA can bind up to 10 zinc ions with four high-affinity zinc binding sites [[cite:PUB00159005]]. The structures of ZrgA from Vibrio cholerae and its homologue, protein PA4063 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were determined bound to zinc, [pdbe:8F1B] and [pdbe:7BGO], respectively [[cite:PUB00159005], [cite:PUB00159006]]. These proteins adopt an α/β structure consisting of a six-stranded meander β-sheet and two α-helices packed on it with an unique topology.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8ezw", "name" "Structure of Apo ZrgA deletion 124-184 from Vibrio cholerae"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10986" "Protein of unknown function (DUF2796)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc-specific solute binding protein ZrgA", "short" "ZrgA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 576, "taxa" 2985, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3495, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3100, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2337}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021253", :literature {"PUB00159002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zheng C" "Qiu J" "Zhai Y" "Wei M" "Zhou X" "Jiao X."], "ISO_journal" "Virulence", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2022.2156196", "medline_journal" "Virulence", "title" "ZrgA contributes to zinc acquisition in Vibrio parahaemolyticus.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2156196", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36482737}, "PUB00159005" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Valencia DW" "Melendez AB" "Melendrez IA" "Yukl ET."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24010548", "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Structure and Function of the Zinc Binding Protein ZrgA from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "548", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36613986}, "PUB00159006" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 11", "authors" ["Fiorillo A" "Battistoni A" "Ammendola S" "Secli V" "Rinaldo S" "Cutruzzola F" "Demitri N" "Ilari A."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798321009608", "medline_journal" "Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol", "title" "Structure and metal-binding properties of PA4063, a novel player in periplasmic zinc trafficking by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "1401-1410", "volume" "77", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34726168}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021253", "name" "Zinc-specific solute binding protein ZrgA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 29, "alignment:full" 692}}}
