{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are zinc-containing enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in a two-step mechanism: a nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion on carbon dioxide, followed by the regeneration of the active site by ionization of the zinc-bound water molecule and removal of a proton from the active site. They are ubiquitous enzymes involved in fundamental processes like photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis and ion transport. Most alpha CAs are monomeric enzymes. The zinc ion is complexed by three histidines [[cite:PUB00092017], [cite:PUB00017891], [cite:PUB00092021]]. This vertebrate subgroup comprises isozyme VII. CA VII is the most active cytosolic enzyme after CA II, and may be highly expressed in the brain. Human CA VII may be a target of antiepileptic sulfonamides/sulfamates [[cite:PUB00092047]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8q3u", "name" "Crystal structure of a fentanyl derivative in complex with human CA VII"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036398", "name" "Alpha carbonic anhydrase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03149" "alpha_CA_VII"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbonic anhydrase VII", "short" "Alpha_CA_VII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 442, "taxa" 1397, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 553, "sets" 0, "proteins" 553, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 433}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
