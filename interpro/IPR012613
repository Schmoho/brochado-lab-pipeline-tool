{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) O type (sspO). SspO (originally cotK) are unique to the spores of Bacillus subtilis and are expressed only in the forespore compartment of sporulating cells of this organism. The sspO is the first gene in a likely operon with sspP and transcription of this gene is primarily by RNA polymerase with the forespore-specific sigma factor, sigma-G. Mutation deleting sspO causes the loss of the SspO from the forespore but had no discernible effect on sporulation, spore properties or spore germination [[cite:PUB00016550]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00665" "Small, acid-soluble spore protein O [sspO]"}, "pfam" {"PF08175" "Small acid-soluble spore protein O family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02864" "small acid-soluble spore protein O"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small acid-soluble spore protein, SspO", "short" "SASP_SspO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 192, "taxa" 678, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 630, "sets" 0, "proteins" 630, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 454}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012613", :literature {"PUB00016550" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Cabrera-Hernandez A" "Setlow P."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(00)00125-6", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Analysis of the regulation and function of five genes encoding small, acid-soluble spore proteins of Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "169-81", "volume" "248", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10806362}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030436", "name" "asexual sporulation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0042601", "name" "endospore-forming forespore", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012613", "name" "Small acid-soluble spore protein, SspO", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 182}}}
