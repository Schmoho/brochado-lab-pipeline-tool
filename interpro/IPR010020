{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry identifies a clade of sequences from gamma and beta proteobacteria.  These proteins are more than 700 amino acids long and many have been annotated as putative membrane proteins.  The gene from Salmonella has been annotated as a putative efflux transporter.  The gene from Escherichia coli has been annotated as yccS. The YccS hypothetical equivalog is found in beta and gamma proteobacteria, while the smaller YhfK group is only found in E. coli, Salmonella and Yersinia.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01667" "YccS/YhfK family putative transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Integral membrane protein, YccS/YhfK", "short" "Integral_membrane_YCCS_YHJK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 451, "taxa" 3587, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5629, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5629, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4277}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010020", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010020", "name" "Integral membrane protein, YccS/YhfK", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR010019", "name" "Integral membrane protein, YccS", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
