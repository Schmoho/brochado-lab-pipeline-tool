{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a group of peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family U32 (clan U-). They are classified as collagenases as they are present in bacterial collagenases, involved in bacterial infection.  For example, Porphyromonas gingivalis PrtC (Bacteroides gingivalis) [[cite:PUB00002182]], is an enzyme that degrades type I collagen and that seems to require a metal cofactor, or Helicobacter pylori HP0169, another Peptidase U32 protein is required for colonisation of mouse gut.</p>\n<p>Novel functions of peptidase U32 proteins have been found, suggesting that these peptidases are involved in diverse cellular processes. The conservation of a CX6CX15CX3/4C motif in several U32 proteases indicates that these proteins bind [Fe-S] clusters. RlhA, a member of the U32 protease family involved in the C-hydroxylation of a cytidine on E. coli 23S rRNA is a Fe-S protein related to iron metabolism [[cite:PUB00094342]]. TrhP (tRNA hydroxylation protein P), a member of this family, is involved in prephenate-dependent formation of 5-hydroxyuridine (ho5U) modification at position 34 in tRNAs, the first step in 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U) biosynthesis, which is important for tRNA hydroxylation ensuring the efficient decoding during protein synthesis [[cite:PUB00094522]]. UbiU-UbiV are involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in which the 4Fe-4S clusters bind to each protein have a role in electron transfer chains in hydroxylation reactions [[cite:PUB00094343]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The peptidases families associated with clan U-have an unknown catalytic mechanism as the protein fold of the active site domain and the active site residues have not been reported.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS01276" "Peptidase family U32 signature"}, "pfam" {"PF01136" "Peptidase family U32"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase U32", "short" "Peptidase_U32"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 54, "proteomes" 4387, "taxa" 20255, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49752, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33994}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00982", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00982"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001539", :literature {"PUB00094343" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Pelosi L" "Vo CD" "Abby SS" "Loiseau L" "Rascalou B" "Hajj Chehade M" "Faivre B" "Gousse M" "Chenal C" "Touati N" "Binet L" "Cornu D" "Fyfe CD" "Fontecave M" "Barras F" "Lombard M" "Pierrel F."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Ubiquinone Biosynthesis over the Entire O2 Range: Characterization of a Conserved O2-Independent Pathway.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31289180}, "PUB00094342" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Kimura S" "Sakai Y" "Ishiguro K" "Suzuki T."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Biogenesis and iron-dependency of ribosomal RNA hydroxylation.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "12974-12986", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29069499}, "PUB00002182" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kato T" "Takahashi N" "Kuramitsu HK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
