{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These proteins contain one copy of the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain ([interpro:IPR004843]), followed by a carboxyl-terminal extension that is less well conserved. They possess motifs characteristic of a variety of enzymatically active phosphoesterases [[cite:PUB00014394]], including acid and alkaline phosphatases, phosphoprotein phosphatases, 5'-nucleotidase, bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (symmetrical), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, 2',3'-cylic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase, and 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase CpdA. They appear to be similar to exonuclease SbcD ([interpro:IPR004593]), but their catalytic activity has not been characterised.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF033091" "Predicted phosphoesterase, YhaO type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Predicted phosphoesterase, YhaO type", "short" "Pesterase_YhaO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1139, "taxa" 4830, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4266, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4256, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3224}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014576", :literature {"PUB00014394" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Klabunde T" "Strater N" "Frohlich R" "Witzel H" "Krebs B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
