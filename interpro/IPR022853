{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents flotillin-like protein FloA  from bacteria.</p>\n\n<p>Bacterial flotillin-like proteins are found in membrane microdomains that may be equivalent to eukaryotic membrane rafts [[cite:PUB00099631]]. Similarly to eukaryotic flotillin proteins, flotillins in bacteria play an essential role in organizing and maintaining the correct architecture of the functional membrane microdomains [[cite:PUB00099632], [cite:PUB00099653]]. Bacillus subtilis has two flotillin paralogs, FloT and FloA. The absence of one of the flotillins has only minor effects, but the absence of both proteins has very severe effects: loss of proper cell shape, a defect in cell division [[cite:PUB00099653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12127" "Flotillin-like protein FloA"}, "hamap" {"MF_01562" "Flotillin-like protein FloA [floA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flotillin-like protein FloA", "short" "FloA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 1384, "taxa" 5468, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6657, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6642, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4946}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022853", :literature {"PUB00099653" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Dempwolff F" "Schmidt FK" "Hervas AB" "Stroh A" "Rosch TC" "Riese CN" "Dersch S" "Heimerl T" "Lucena D" "Hulsbusch N" "Stuermer CA" "Takeshita N" "Fischer R" "Eckhardt B" "Graumann PL."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "Super Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy and Tracking of Bacterial Flotillin (Reggie) Paralogs Provide Evidence for Defined-Sized Protein Microdomains within the Bacterial Membrane but Absence of Clusters Containing Detergent-Resistant Proteins.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1006116", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27362352}, "PUB00099632" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bramkamp M" "Lopez D."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol Mol Biol Rev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiol Mol Biol Rev", "title" "Exploring the existence of lipid rafts in bacteria.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "81-100", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25652542}, "PUB00099631" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Lopez D" "Kolter R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Functional microdomains in bacterial membranes.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1893-902", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20713508}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022853", "name" "Flotillin-like protein FloA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 52, "alignment:full" 1539}}}
