{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family range in size from 34 to 53 residues, including from four to seven Cys residues. Multiple strains of Clostridium botulinum show seven tandem members upstream of a radical SAM/SPASM domain protein likely to act as a ribosomal natural product maturase. By analogy to subtilosin A, the Cys residues are likely targets for modifications that may introduce new crosslinks. Across multiple strains of Clostridium botulinum and C. sporogenes, the adjacent radical SAM enzyme is nearly invariant.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04333" "Clo7bot family Cys-rich peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cys-rich peptide, Clo7bot family", "short" "Clo7Bot_mod_Cys"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 123, "sets" 0, "proteins" 123, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 102}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1062", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1062"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027601", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027601", "name" "Cys-rich peptide, Clo7bot family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
