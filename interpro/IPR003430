{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes several components of multicomponent enzyme systems predominantly found in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Propane 2-monooxygenase multicomponent enzyme system is involved in the degradation of propane via the O2-dependent hydroxylation of propane [[cite:PUB00088161]]. Propane 2-monooxygenase, hydroxylase component large and small subunit are also included in this entry.</li>\n<li>Phenol hydroxylase is a multicomponent enzyme that catabolises phenol and some of its methylated derivatives  [[cite:PUB00002124], [cite:PUB00100233]]. This family includes Phenol 2-monooxygenase, oxygenase component DmpL/DmpN, part of the oxygenase component of the complex in Pseudomonas sp. [[cite:PUB00100255]].</li>\n<li>Methane monooxygenase component A is responsible for the initial oxygenation of methane to methanol in methanotrophs. It also catalyses the monohydroxylation of a variety of unactivated alkenes, alicyclic, aromatic and heterocyclic compounds. This family contains the alpha and beta chain of Methane monooxygenase component A.</li>\n<li>Toluene-4-monooxygenase system, hydroxylase component subunits alpha and beta are also included in this family. These proteins hydroxylate toluene to form P-cresol in Pseudomonas mendocina [[cite:PUB00012297]].</li>\n<li>Alkene monooxygenase system from Xanthobacter autotrophicus catalyses the O2 and NADH-dependent epoxidation of short chain (C2 to C6) alkenes to their corresponding epoxides [[cite:PUB00088050]]. Oxygenase component subunits alpha and beta also belong to this group of proteins.</li>\n</ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rmk", "name" "Toluene 4 monooxygenase H with 4-bromophenol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012348", "name" "Ribonucleotide reductase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02332" "Methane/Phenol/Alkene Hydroxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Propane/methane/phenol/toluene hydroxylase", "short" "Phenol_Hydrox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 88, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 506, "taxa" 2962, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6509, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6505, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5636}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
