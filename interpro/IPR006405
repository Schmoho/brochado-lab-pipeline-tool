{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A deep split separates two related families of proteins, one of which includes experimentally characterised examples of nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase ([interpro:IPR006406]), the first enzyme of NAD salvage biosynthesis. This entry represents the other family. Members have a different (longer) spacing of several key motifs and have an additional C-terminal domain of up to 100 residues. One argument suggesting that this family represents the same enzyme is that no species has a member of both families. Another is that the gene encoding this protein is located near other NAD salvage biosynthesis genes in Nostoc and in at least four different Gram-positive bacteria. NAD and NADP are ubiquitous in life. Most members of this family are from Gram-positive bacteria. An additional set of mutually closely related archaeal sequences score between the trusted and noise cut-offs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4mzy", "name" "Crystal structure of enterococcus faecalis nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase with malonate and phosphate bound"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036068", "name" "Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase-like, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01513" "nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase pncB-type", "short" "Nic_PRibTrfase_pncB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5474, "taxa" 20549, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19249, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14288}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
