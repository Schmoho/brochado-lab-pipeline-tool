{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes Angiomotin and related proteins. These proteins are involved in the regulation of cell polarity, proliferation, and migration, particularly in endothelial cells. They play a key role in angiogenesis and the maintenance of actin filament architecture [[cite:PUB00154976], [cite:PUB00154977]]. Angiomotin-like protein 2 inhibits the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by sequestering CTNNB1 to recycling endosomes, preventing its nuclear translocation [[cite:PUB00154978]]. Additionally, they regulate the translocation of phosphorylated SRC to cell-matrix adhesion sites and selectively promote FGF-induced MAPK activation through SRC. These proteins are also implicated in tight junction maintenance and may interact with ARHGAP17 and angiostatin [[cite:PUB00154976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14826" "ANGIOMOTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Angiomotin-like", "short" "Angiomotin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 933, "taxa" 3661, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3906, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3906, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2491}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR051747", :literature {"PUB00154978" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Hwang D" "Kim M" "Kim S" "Kwon MR" "Kang YS" "Kim D" "Kang HC" "Lim DS."], "ISO_journal" "Life Sci Alliance", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202000953", "medline_journal" "Life Sci Alliance", "title" "AMOTL2 mono-ubiquitination by WWP1 promotes contact inhibition by facilitating LATS activation.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e202000953", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34404733}, "PUB00154977" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hildebrand S" "Hultin S" "Subramani A" "Petropoulos S" "Zhang Y" "Cao X" "Mpindi J" "Kalloniemi O" "Johansson S" "Majumdar A" "Lanner F" "Holmgren L."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-10102-w", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "The E-cadherin/AmotL2 complex organizes actin filaments required for epithelial hexagonal packing and blastocyst hatching.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "9540", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28842668}, "PUB00154976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhao B" "Li L" "Lu Q" "Wang LH" "Liu CY" "Lei Q" "Guan KL."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.2000111", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Angiomotin is a novel Hippo pathway component that inhibits YAP oncoprotein.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "51-63", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21205866}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR051747", "name" "Angiomotin-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
