{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents TrsS (Third Radical SAM Selenoprotein) which joins two others radical SAM enzyme families of selenocysteine-containing family members. The other two are the arsenosugar biosynthesis radical SAM protein ArsS ([interpro:IPR026351]) and the CUAEP/CCAEP-tail radical SAM protein family. In all three cases, the Sec residue occurs where the Cys normally present is part of a novel motif, not the signature [4Fe-4S]-binding signature motif near the N-terminal of the radical SAM domain described [interpro:IPR007197]. TrsS shows its greatest sequence similarity, among characterized radical SAM proteins, to the molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis protein MoaA, as found either in bacteria ([interpro:IPR013483]) or archaea ([interpro:IPR013485]), but is actually quite different, with novel additional domains both N-terminal and C-terminal to the shared radical SAM domain. Even so, TrsS may play a related role in the maturation of a molybdopterin (MPT) required by the molybdopterin-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase that is nearly always found encoded nearby.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045646" "radical SAM (seleno)protein TrsS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Radical SAM (seleno)protein TrsS", "short" "rSAM_Se_TrsS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 143, "taxa" 794, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 515, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 407}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054698", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034474", "name" "Methyltransferase, class D", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR034471", "name" "GDGT/MA synthase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR054698", "name" "Radical SAM (seleno)protein TrsS", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
