{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PhoU is a negative regulator in Pho regulon which plays a key role in phosphate homeostasis [[cite:PUB00068214], [cite:PUB00068215]]. Members of the Pho regulon include alkaline phosphatase (AP), the PhoB-PhoR proteins and the PstSCAB and PhoU proteins. PhoU is encoded together with proteins of the phosphate-specific transport (Pst) system in the polycistronic pstSCAB-phoU operon. PhoU is essential for the repression of the Pho regulon at high phosphate conditions by a mechanism which is not fully understood. It has been proposed that PhoU may not only control the abundance of the PstSCAB2 transporter through the PhoBR two-component signaling pathway, but also control its activity [[cite:PUB00068216]]. PhoU is known to interact with PhoR and PstB, and it may be involved in the formation of a signaling complex at the cytoplasmic membrane that responds to environmental Pi levels [[cite:PUB00076908]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sum", "name" "Crystal structure of a hypothetical protein at 2.0 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038078", "name" "PhoU-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42930" "PHOSPHATE-SPECIFIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM ACCESSORY PROTEIN PHOU"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003107" "Phosphate transport system protein PhoU"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02135" "phosphate signaling complex protein PhoU"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphate transport system protein PhoU", "short" "P_transport_PhoU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7896, "taxa" 31040, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42852, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42813, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33786}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0190", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0190"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028366", :literature {"PUB00076908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Gardner SG" "Johns KD" "Tanner R" "McCleary WR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
