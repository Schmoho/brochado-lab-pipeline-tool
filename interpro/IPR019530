{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are specialised organelles found at the periphery of cells of diverse organisms. Intra-flagellar transport (IFT) is required for the assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia and flagella, and consists of the bi-directional movement of large protein particles between the base and the distal tip of the organelle. IFT particles contain multiple copies of two distinct protein complexes, A and B, which contain at least 6 and 11 protein subunits. IFT57 is part of complex B but is not, however, required for the core subunits to stay associated [[cite:PUB00044313]]. This protein is known as Huntington-interacting protein-1 in humans.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10498" "Intra-flagellar transport protein 57"}, "panther" {"PTHR16011" "IFT57/HIPPI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intra-flagellar transport protein 57", "short" "Intra-flagellar_transport_57"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 35, "proteomes" 1133, "taxa" 4628, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2431, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2329, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1595}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019530", :literature {"PUB00044313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Lucker BF" "Behal RH" "Qin H" "Siron LC" "Taggart WD" "Rosenbaum JL" "Cole DG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
