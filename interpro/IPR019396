{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents conserved transmembrane proteins that in humans are expressed from a region upstream of the FragileXF site and appear to be intimately linked with Fragile-X syndrome. The absence of the human TMEM185A protein does not necessarily lead to developmental delay, but might, in combination with other, currently unknown, factors. Alternatively, the TMEM185A protein is either redundant, or its function can be complemented by the highly similar chromosome 2 retro-pseudogene product, TMEM185B [[cite:PUB00044516]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10269" "Transmembrane Fragile-X-F protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR13568" "FAM11A, B PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane Fragile-X-F-associated protein", "short" "TM_Fragile-X-F-assoc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 94, "proteomes" 1480, "taxa" 6087, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6440, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6192, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4205}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019396", :literature {"PUB00044516" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Shaw MA" "Chiurazzi P" "Romain DR" "Neri G" "Gecz J."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
