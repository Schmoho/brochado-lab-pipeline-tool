{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family adopt a secondary structure consisting of five short β-strands (beta1-beta5), which are arranged in two antiparallel distorted sheets formed by strands beta1-beta4-beta5 and beta2-beta3 facing each other. This β-sandwich is stabilised by six enclosed cysteines arranged in a [1-2, 3-5, 4-6] disulphide pairing resulting in a disulphide-rich hydrophobic core that is largely inaccessible to bulk solvent. The close proximity of disulphide bonds [3-5] and  [4-6] organises haemadin into four distinct loops. The N-terminal segment of this domain binds to the active site of thrombin, inhibiting it [[cite:PUB00024384]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024793", "name" "Thrombin inhibitor hirudin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011061", "name" "Hirudin/antistatin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09065" "Haemadin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haemadin", "short" "Haemadin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015150", :literature {"PUB00024384" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Richardson JL" "Kroger B" "Hoeffken W" "Sadler JE" "Pereira P" "Huber R" "Bode W" "Fuentes-Prior P."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/19.21.5650", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Crystal structure of the human alpha-thrombin-haemadin complex: an exosite II-binding inhibitor.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "5650-60", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11060016}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015150", "name" "Haemadin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
