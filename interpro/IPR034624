{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The experimentally characterized member of the xylonate dehydratase 2 family from<i>Haloferax volcanii</i>has been shown to catalyze the dehydration of D-xylonate to 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-xylonate as part of the D-xylose degradation pathway. The enzyme also turns over D-gluconate. Though this enzyme catalyzes the same overall reaction as those in the xylonate dehydratase 1 family, it is more closely related to other characterized enzymes in the mandelate racemase subgroup, and thus has been categorized as a separate family [[cite:PUB00060542]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036849", "name" "Enolase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00564" "xylonate dehydratase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Xylonate dehydratase 2", "short" "Xylonate_dehydratase_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 103, "taxa" 528, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 526, "sets" 0, "proteins" 526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 461}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
