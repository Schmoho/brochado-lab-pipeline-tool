Beta-amylases, which are found in plants and bacteria, hydrolyse 1,4-alpha-glucosidic linkages in starch-type polysaccharide substrates, removing successive maltose units from the non-reducing ends of the chains. In Solanum tuberosum (potato), the enzyme has been found to work optimally at 40 degrees C, becoming unstable above this temperature. On the basis of sequence comparisons, plant and bacterial beta-amylases can be readily distinguished from each other.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structure of a complex of soybean beta-amylase with an inhibitor (alpha-cyclodextrin) has been determined to 3.0A resolution by X-ray diffraction [[cite:PUB00002354]]. The enzyme folds into large and small domains: the large domain has a (β α)8 super-secondary structural core, while the smaller is formed from two long loops extending from the β3 and β4 strands of the (β α)8 fold [[cite:PUB00002354]]. The interface of the two domains, together with shorter loops from the (β α)8 core, form a deep cleft, in which the inhibitor binds [[cite:PUB00002354]]. Two maltose molecules also bind in the cleft, one sharing a binding site with alpha-cyclodextrin, and the other sitting more deeply in the cleft [[cite:PUB00002354]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00842" "GLHYDLASE14B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 14B, plant", "short" "Glyco_hydro_14B_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 253, "taxa" 1088, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12227, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2541, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1580}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GH14", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GH14.html"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
