{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents RNA transcription, translation and transport factor protein (RTRAF, also known as hCLE/C14orf166) from eukaryotes. It is part of the DDX1-HSPC117-FAM98B complex that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm transporting RNAs [[cite:PUB00088063]]. It is also a component of the tRNA-splicing ligase complex and is required for tRNA ligation [[cite:PUB00088064]]. Human RTRAF works as a positive modulator of the RNA polymerase II activity [[cite:PUB00088061]]. It also interacts with influenza virus polymerase subunit PA and plays an important role in influenza virus replication [[cite:PUB00088066]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7p3a", "name" "N-terminal domain of CGI-99"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10036" "RNA transcription, translation and transport factor protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR15924" "CLE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA transcription, translation and transport factor protein", "short" "RTRAF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 1078, "taxa" 4414, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2149, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2033, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1431}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1707", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1707"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019265", :literature {"PUB00088061" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Perez-Gonzalez A" "Rodriguez A" "Huarte M" "Salanueva IJ" "Nieto A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
