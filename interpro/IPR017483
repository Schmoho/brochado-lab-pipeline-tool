{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family have been found in several species of gammaproteobacteria, including Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Xylella fastidiosa, and Escherichia coli (strain UTI89 / UPEC). As many as five members can be found in a single genome; their function is unknown. Recently, it was proposed that members of this family along with members of [[interpro:IPR010351]] should be recognised as a putative toxin-antitoxin pair in which [[interpro:IPR017483]] is a homologue of Colicin M and [[interpro:IPR010351]] acts as its cognate immunity protein [[cite:PUB00154362]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11692" "Protein of unknown function (DUF3289)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03034" "YPO3983 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03034", "short" "CHP03034"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 33, "proteomes" 94, "taxa" 740, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1038, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 793}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017483", :literature {"PUB00154362" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Geller AM" "Shalom M" "Zlotkin D" "Blum N" "Levy A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Syst Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s44320-024-00035-8", "medline_journal" "Mol Syst Biol", "title" "Identification of type VI secretion system effector-immunity pairs using structural bioinformatics.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38658795}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017483", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03034", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 188}}}
