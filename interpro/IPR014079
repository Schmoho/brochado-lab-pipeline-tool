{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are phosphate butyryltransferase enzymes, also called phosphotransbutyrylase. In general, this enzyme is found in butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria, encoded next to the gene for butyrate kinase. Together, these two enzymes represent what may be the less common of two pathways for butyrate production from butyryl-CoA. The alternative is transfer of the CoA group to acetate by butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase. This entry does not include the homologue from Thermotoga maritima, whose activity on butyryl-CoA is only 30 % of its activity with acetyl-CoA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02706" "phosphate butyryltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphate butyryltransferase", "short" "Phosphate_butyryltransferase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 317, "taxa" 1176, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1088, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 800}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0910", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0910"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
