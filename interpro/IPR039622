In animals, the methylation signal is recognized by methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins that specifically bind methylated CpG dinucleotides. In Arabidopsis thaliana 12 putative MBD proteins have been identified. However, the presence of an MBD motif does not necessarily point to methyl-CpG-binding activity. The Arabidopsis proteins AtMBD5, AtMBD6 and AtMBD7 have been proven to bind methyl CpG in vitro and to localize to highly methylated chromocentres in vivo, but none of the other Arabidopsis MBD-containing proteins show these properties, and therefore seem to be non-functional MBDs [[cite:PUB00015391], [cite:PUB00088587]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33729" "METHYL-CPG BINDING DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN, EXPRESSED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyl-CpG-binding domain-containing protein 10/11", "short" "MBD10/11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 239, "taxa" 912, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1261, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 754}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039622", :literature {"PUB00015391" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zemach A" "Grafi G."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01756.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "565-72", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12787239}, "PUB00088587" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zemach A" "Grafi G."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Plant Sci.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2006.12.004", "medline_journal" "Trends Plant Sci", "title" "Methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins in plants: interpreters of DNA methylation.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "80-5", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17208509}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039622", "name" "Methyl-CpG-binding domain-containing protein 10/11", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
