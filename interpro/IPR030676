{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CitT catalyses a homologous exchange of citrate or a heterologous exchange against succinate, fumarate, or tartrate. Since succinate is the end product of citrate fermentation in E. coli, it is likely that CitT functions in vivo as a citrate/succinate antiporter. CitT is related to other transporters that could constitute a novel family of eubacterial transporters involved in the transport of di- and tricarboxylic acids [[cite:PUB00073655]]. Included in this group would be the L-tartrate/succinate antiporter TtdT (YgjE) from E. coli [[cite:PUB00073654]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002457" "Divalent anion sodium symporter"}, "panther" {"PTHR42826" "DICARBOXYLATE TRANSPORTER 2.1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate carrier CitT-related", "short" "CitT-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1691, "taxa" 9020, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12709, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12690, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9535}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030676", :literature {"PUB00073654" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kim OB" "Unden G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
