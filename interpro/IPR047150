{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the SGT family, which includes Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha/beta (SGTA/B) from humans and similar sequences spread in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. SGT is a co-chaperone that binds misfolded and hydrophobic patches-containing client proteins in the cytosol. It mediates their targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum but also regulates their sorting to the proteasome when targeting fails [[cite:PUB00086008]]. SGT binds directly to HSC70 and HSP70 and regulates their ATPase activity [[cite:PUB00049961]]. Most members of this family contain tetratricopeptide repeats.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5lyn", "name" "Structure of the Tpr Domain of Sgt2 in complex with yeast Ssa1 peptide fragment"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45831" "LD24721P"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SGT", "short" "SGT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2903, "taxa" 11430, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9255, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6316}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047150", :literature {"PUB00049961" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Dutta S" "Tan YJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi800758a", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Structural and functional characterization of human SGT and its interaction with Vpu of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "10123-31", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18759457}, "PUB00086008" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6322", "authors" ["Shao S" "Rodrigo-Brenni MC" "Kivlen MH" "Hegde RS."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah6130", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Mechanistic basis for a molecular triage reaction.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "298-302", "volume" "355", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28104892}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047150", "name" "SGT", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
