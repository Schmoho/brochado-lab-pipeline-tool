{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Elicitins are small, highly-conserved proteins secreted by phytopathogenic fungi belonging to the phytophthora species [[cite:PUB00004861]]. They are toxic proteins reponsible for inducing a necrotic and systemic hypersensitive response in plants from the solanaceae and cruciferae families. Leaf necrosis provides immediate control of fungal invasion and induces systemic acquired resistance; both responses mediate basic protection against subsequent pathogen inoculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this family share a high level of sequence similarity, but they differ in net charge, dividing them into two classes: alpha and beta [[cite:PUB00004861], [cite:PUB00071926]]. Alpha-elicitins are highly acidic, with a valine residue at position 13, whereas beta-elicitins are basic, with a lysine at the same position. Residue 13 is known to be involved in the control of necrosis and, being exposed, is thought to be involved in ligand/receptor binding [[cite:PUB00071926], [cite:PUB00005045]]. Phenotypically, the two classes can be distinguished by their necrotic properties: beta-elicitins are 100-fold more toxic and provide better subsequent protection [[cite:PUB00004861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2aib", "name" "beta-cinnamomin in complex with ergosterol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036470", "name" "Elicitin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01187" "Elicitin"}, "pfam" {"PF00964" "Elicitin"}, "prints" {"PR00948" "ELICITIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Elicitin", "short" "Elicitin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 38, "proteomes" 37, "taxa" 174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3057, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2607, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1857}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002200", :literature {"PUB00004861" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Yu LM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
