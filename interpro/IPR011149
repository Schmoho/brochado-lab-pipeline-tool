{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Archaeal DNA polymerase II (Pol II, or Pol D) is heterodimeric, containing a DP1 small subunit, and a DP2 large subunit, the latter acting as the catalytic subunit. This entry represents the DP1 small subunit, which shows sequence similarity with the small subunit of eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta; a homologue of this protein has not been found in bacteria.
