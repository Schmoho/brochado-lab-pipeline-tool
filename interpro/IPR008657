{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains several jumping translocation breakpoint proteins or JTBs. Jumping translocation (JT) is an unbalanced translocation that comprises amplified chromosomal segments jumping to various telomeres. JTB, located at 1q21, has been found to fuse with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres in a case of JT. hJTB (Homo sapiens JTB) encodes a transmembrane protein that is highly conserved among divergent eukaryotic species. JT results in a hJTB truncation, which potentially produces an hJTB product devoid of the transmembrane domain. hJTB is located in a gene-rich region at 1q21, called EDC (Epidermal Differentiation Complex) [[cite:PUB00011357]]. JTB has also been implicated in prostatic carcinomas [[cite:PUB00011358]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05439" "Jumping translocation breakpoint protein (JTB)"}, "panther" {"PTHR13041" "JTB PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Jumping translocation breakpoint", "short" "JTB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 872, "taxa" 3747, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1478, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1463, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 937}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008657", :literature {"PUB00011357" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Hatakeyama S" "Osawa M" "Omine M" "Ishikawa F."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1202510", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "JTB: a novel membrane protein gene at 1q21 rearranged in a jumping translocation.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "2085-90", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10321732}, "PUB00011358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Platica O" "Chen S" "Ivan E" "Lopingco MC" "Holland JF" "Platica M."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
