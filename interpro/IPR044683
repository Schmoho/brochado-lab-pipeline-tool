{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the LAZY proteins (also known as NEGATIVE GRAVITROPIC RESPONSE OF ROOTS (NGR) or DEEPER ROOTING (DRO)), a family of plant proteins involved in the proper distribution of auxin and in the regulation of both roots and shoots response to gravitropism (Jiao et al, Front. Plant Sci, 2021, doi:10.3389/fpls.2020.606241) [[cite:PUB00096788], [cite:PUB00088571]]. Statocytes are gravity-sensing cells that perceive directional signals of gravity, which leads to asymmetric distribution of auxin in the responding organs. These proteins are involved in the development of the root system architecture by influencing lateral root angles and primary root length [[cite:PUB00096789], [cite:PUB00096787], [cite:PUB00096790]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34045" "OS03G0406300 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LAZY family", "short" "LAZY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 223, "taxa" 857, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 670}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044683", :literature {"PUB00088571" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Taniguchi M" "Furutani M" "Nishimura T" "Nakamura M" "Fushita T" "Iijima K" "Baba K" "Tanaka H" "Toyota M" "Tasaka M" "Morita MT."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.16.00575", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The Arabidopsis LAZY1 Family Plays a Key Role in Gravity Signaling within Statocytes and in Branch Angle Control of Roots and Shoots.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1984-1999", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28765510}, "PUB00096787" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Waite JM" "Collum TD" "Dardick C."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "AtDRO1 is nuclear localized in root tips under native conditions and impacts auxin localization.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "197-210", "volume" "103", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32130643}, "PUB00096788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ge L" "Chen R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Plants", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Plants", "title" "Negative gravitropism in plant roots.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "16155", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27748769}, "PUB00096789" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Guseman JM" "Webb K" "Srinivasan C" "Dardick C."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "DRO1 influences root system architecture in Arabidopsis and Prunus species.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1093-1105", "volume" "89", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28029738}, "PUB00096790" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yoshihara T" "Spalding EP."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "LAZY Genes Mediate the Effects of Gravity on Auxin Gradients and Plant Architecture.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "959-969", "volume" "175", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28821594}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009630", "name" "gravitropism", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0040008", "name" "regulation of growth", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044683", "name" "LAZY family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
