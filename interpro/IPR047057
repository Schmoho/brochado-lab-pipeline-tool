{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents MerR family of transcriptional regulators, a group of transcriptional activators with similar N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding regions and C-terminal effector binding regions that are specific to the effector recognised [[cite:PUB00017958], [cite:PUB00101736]]. MerR-type regulators are present in diverse bacterial genera, in the cytoplasm. The helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif is located in the N-terminal part of these transcriptional regulators and is followed by a coiled-coil region. The C-terminal part of merR-type regulators contains effector binding regions that are specific to the effector recognised. Most merR-type transcriptional regulators respond to environmental stimuli, like heavy metals, oxidative stress or antibiotics and a subgroup of metalloregulators are bacterial transcription activators that respond to metal ions [[cite:PUB00017958]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3gp4", "name" "Crystal structure of putative MerR family transcriptional regulator from listeria monocytogenes"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009061", "name" "Putative DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30204" "REDOX-CYCLING DRUG-SENSING TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR SOXR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MerR transcriptional regulator", "short" "MerR_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 70, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8672, "taxa" 33377, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 200889, "sets" 0, "proteins" 200889, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 154669}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047057", :literature {"PUB00017958" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Brown NL" "Stoyanov JV" "Kidd SP" "Hobman JL."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
