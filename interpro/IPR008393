{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The late transcription region 2 (L2) of Adenovirus type 2 has an ORF of 80 residues positioned between nucleotides 17,676 and 17,915. It encodes an 11K polypeptide, which has the initiating methionine residue removed, leaving a 79-residue product. The L2 region that encoded 11K polypeptide is arginine rich (21%) and has a predicted molecular weight of 8,715. It was cleaved by the viral endoprotease to give two products which co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels as virion polypeptide X [[cite:PUB00011541]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of the L2 precursor, by virtue of its two domains, might be to condense the viral prochromatin for encapsidation. Subsequent cleavage within the particle after residue 31 releases the cross-link and prepares the viral chromatin for a relaxed conformation, which is required during infection and uncoating. Cleavage seems to be necessary for infectivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family consists of several adenovirus late L2 mu core protein or protein X sequences [[cite:PUB00011541]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05829" "Adenovirus late L2 mu core protein (Protein X)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus late L2 mu core", "short" "Adenovirus_late_L2_mu_core"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 68, "taxa" 325, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 328, "sets" 0, "proteins" 328, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008393", :literature {"PUB00011541" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Weber JM" "Anderson CW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
