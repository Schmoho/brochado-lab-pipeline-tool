{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trichome birefringence-like (TBL) is a plant protein family. In Arabidopsis this family includes 46 members (TBR, TBL1-45) [[cite:PUB00071378]]. The TBL family is proposed to encode wall polysaccharide specific O-acetyltransferases [[cite:PUB00071379], [cite:PUB00071380]]. They contain a TBL domain with a conserved glycine-aspartate-serine (GDS) signature, similar to the conserved motif (GDSL) found in some esterases/lipases [[cite:PUB00071378], [cite:PUB00059928]]. Members of the TBL protein family had been shown to impact pathogen resistance, freezing tolerance, and cellulose biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00071380]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6cci", "name" "The Crystal Structure of XOAT1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32285" "PROTEIN TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE 9-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trichome birefringence-like family", "short" "TBL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 444, "taxa" 1730, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25530, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25530, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15011}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
