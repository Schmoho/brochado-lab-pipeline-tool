{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of bacterial and fungal sequences, including 2-oxoadipate dioxygenase/decarboxylase (YdcJ, also known as HGLS) from Escherichia coli. YdcJ, which is involved in D-lysine metabolism, catalyses a successive decarboxylation and intramolecular hydroxylation of 2-oxoadipate forming 2-hydroxyglutarate in a Fe(II) and oxygen-dependent manner. Members of this protein family are thought to belong to the the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily [[cite:PUB00102156], [cite:PUB00102155]].
