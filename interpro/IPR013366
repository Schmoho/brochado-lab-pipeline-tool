{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Salmonella typhimurium is capable of growth on ethanolamine as a sole source of carbon nitrogen and energy [[cite:PUB00009955]]. During growth on this compound the cells form a multimolecular structure known as a metabolosome, which is similar to the carboxysome used by some photosynthetic bacteria to fix CO2, and is thought to contain the enzymes needed to metabolise this compound to acetyl-CoA.  The metabolosome is not directly involved in the biochemistry of ethanolamine utilization -instead its role is thought to be to concentrate the enzymes involved in this process, while also protecting the cell from the build-up of toxic intermediates [[cite:PUB00020756]].  The genes involved in growth on ethanolamine are encoded in a 17-gene operon known as the ethanolamine utilization (eut) operon. EutJ shows similarity to chaperonins and may play a role in assembly of the metabolosme [[cite:PUB00009955]], though it is not necessary for growth on this compound.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02529" "ethanolamine utilization protein EutJ family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ethanolamine utilisation EutJ", "short" "EutJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 394, "taxa" 2176, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2266, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2266, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1842}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0292", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0292"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013366", :literature {"PUB00009955" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Kofoid E" "Rappleye C" "Stojiljkovic I" "Roth J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
