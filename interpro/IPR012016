{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Phosphomevalonate dehydratase small subunit from Aeropyrum pernix (PMDh-S) and similar prokaryotic proteins. PMDh-S is a component of a hydro-lyase that catalyses the dehydration of mevalonate 5-phosphate (MVA5P) to form trans-anhydromevalonate 5-phosphate (tAHMP) [[cite:PUB00098043], [cite:PUB00154971]]. It is involved in the archaeal mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which provides fundamental precursors for isoprenoid biosynthesis, such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) [[cite:PUB00098043], [cite:PUB00154970]]. Members of this family were previously annotated as aconitase X subunit 2, the swiveling domain subunit [[cite:PUB00080857]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004966" "Predicted aconitase X, swiveling domain subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphomevalonate dehydratase small subunit-like", "short" "PMDh-S-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 256, "taxa" 2117, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2229, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2228, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1832}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
