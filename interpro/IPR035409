{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>There are seven major proteins involved in murine seminal vesicle secretion (SVS1-7). Mouse Svs2/Svs6 genes evolved by gene duplication and belong to the same gene family [[cite:PUB00085355]]. This entry represents SVS4/5 and 6. SVS4 is a basic, thermostable, secretory protein synthesized by rat seminal vesicle epithelium under strict androgen transcriptional control. This protein has potent nonspecies-specific immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and pro-coagulant activities that have been shown to be located in the N-terminal region of Svs4 (fragment 1-70) [[cite:PUB00085356]]. The N-terminal segment has a high amino-acid sequence similarity with the C-terminal segment 34-66 of uteroglobin, a rabbit steroid-inducible, cytokine-like, multifunctional, secreted protein. Furthermore, SVS4 acts as a sperm capacitation inhibitor, by interacting with SVS3 and SVS2 [[cite:PUB00085355]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17498" "SEMINAL VESICLE SECRETORY PROTEIN 6-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF17381" "Seminal vesicle secretory proteins 4/5/6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Seminal vesicle secretory protein 4/5/6", "short" "Svs4/5/6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 53, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035409", :literature {"PUB00085355" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Araki N" "Kawano N" "Kang W" "Miyado K" "Yoshida K" "Yoshida M."], "ISO_journal" "Reproduction", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1530/REP-15-0551", "medline_journal" "Reproduction", "title" "Seminal vesicle proteins SVS3 and SVS4 facilitate SVS2 effect on sperm capacitation.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "313-21", "volume" "152", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27486266}, "PUB00085356" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Ialenti A" "Santagada V" "Caliendo G" "Severino B" "Fiorino F" "Maffia P" "Ianaro A" "Morelli F" "Di Micco B" "Carteni M" "Stiuso P" "Metafora V" "Metafora S."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
