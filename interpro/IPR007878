The viral group of 2H phosphoesterases contains proteins from two unrelated virus types: the type C rotaviruses (VP3 protein, [interpro:IPR011181]) that are double stranded multipartite RNA viruses and the coronaviruses (NS2 protein, this group) that are positive strand RNA viruses. Given that these viruses have vertebrate hosts, it is likely that the 2H phosphoesterase domain was derived from the host by one of virus groups followed by rapid sequence divergence [[cite:PUB00013642]]. Subsequently, it may have been exchanged between the viral families. Although the direction of the exchange is not clear, it is possible that a double stranded replicative form of a subgenomic RNA transcript of the coronavirus NS2 was stabilised by a rotavirus and incorporated into its multiple double stranded RNA genome [[cite:PUB00013642]]. These proteins can be utilised as novel drug targets because of their predicted RNA modification role.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003890" "Predicted phosphoesterase, coronavirus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coronavirus NS2A", "short" "Coronavirus_NS2A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 74, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007878", :literature {"PUB00013642" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Mazumder R" "Iyer LM" "Vasudevan S" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkf645", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Detection of novel members, structure-function analysis and evolutionary classification of the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "5229-43", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12466548}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007878", "name" "Coronavirus NS2A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
