{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are 18kDa serine/threonine-rich polypeptides containing a P-loop motif and an SH3-binding region with phosphorylation sites for a variety of protein kinases (cdc2, CDK2, MAPK, CDK5, protein kinase C, Ca2/calmodulin protein kinase 2, casein kinase 2) involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Functional studies revealed that expression is associated with proliferating and migrating cells in developing brain. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CROC-4 participates in brain-specific c-fos signaling pathways involved in cellular remodeling of brain architecture [[cite:PUB00091146]]. C1orf61 expression was also found associated with the progression of liver disease as well as human embryogenesis. It was shown to be up-regulated in hepatic cirrhosis tissues and further up-regulated in primary hepatocellular carcinoma tumors where it was suggested to play a role as a tumor activator [[cite:PUB00091147]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17691" "Contingent replication of cDNA 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein CROC-4", "short" "CROC-4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 59, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040529", :literature {"PUB00091146" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Jeffrey PL" "Capes-Davis A" "Dunn JM" "Tolhurst O" "Seeto G" "Hannan AJ" "Lin SL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
