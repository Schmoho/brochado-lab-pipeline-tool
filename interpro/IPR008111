{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA-binding motif protein 8 (RBM8), also termed binder of OVCA1-1 (BOV-1) or RNA-binding protein Y14, is one of the components of the exon-exon junction complex (EJC) [[cite:PUB00094479]]. It has two isoforms, RBM8A and RBM8B, both of which are identical except that RBM8B is 16 amino acids shorter at its N terminus [[cite:PUB00010370]]. Three-dimensional modelling of the RBM8 RRM domain indicates that the sequences fold into an RNA-binding domain, forming a hydrophobic core between a Î²-sheet and two helices. The human RBM8A protein is ubiquitously expressed; the protein is localised predominantly in the cell nucleus and diffused throughout the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00010370]]. It preferentially associates with mRNAs produced by splicing, including both nuclear mRNAs and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. Evidence suggests the protein remains associated with spliced mRNAs as a tag to indicate the position of spliced introns. Human RBM8A protein specifically binds to MAGOH, the human homologue of Drosophila mago nashi, a protein required for normal germ plasm development in the Drosophila embryo [[cite:PUB00007285]]; a similar association occurs with the Drosophila RBM8 protein, Tsunagi [[cite:PUB00010398]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1p27", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Human Y14/Magoh complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035979", "name" "RNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012677", "name" "Nucleotide-binding alpha-beta plait domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45894" "RNA-BINDING PROTEIN 8A"}, "prints" {"PR01738" "RNABINDINGM8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding motif protein 8", "short" "RNA-bd_8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2402, "taxa" 8210, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4334, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4170, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2701}, "pathways" 31}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008111", :literature {"PUB00007285" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhao XF" "Nowak NJ" "Shows TB" "Aplan PD."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.1999.6064", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "MAGOH interacts with a novel RNA-binding protein.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "145-8", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10662555}, "PUB00010263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Robbins J" "Dilworth SM" "Laskey RA" "Dingwall C."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(91)90245-T", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Two interdependent basic domains in nucleoplasmin nuclear targeting sequence: identification of a class of bipartite nuclear targeting sequence.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "615-23", "volume" "64", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1991323}, "PUB00010370" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Salicioni AM" "Xi M" "Vanderveer LA" "Balsara B" "Testa JR" "Dunbrack RL Jr" "Godwin AK."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.2000.6315", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Identification and structural analysis of human RBM8A and RBM8B: two highly conserved RNA-binding motif proteins that interact with OVCA1, a candidate tumor suppressor.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "54-62", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11013075}, "PUB00010398" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Mohr SE" "Dillon ST" "Boswell RE."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11691839&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "The RNA-binding protein Tsunagi interacts with Mago Nashi to establish polarity and localize oskar mRNA during Drosophila oogenesis.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2886-99", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11691839}, "PUB00094479" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6375", "authors" ["Zhan X" "Yan C" "Zhang X" "Lei J" "Shi Y."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structure of a human catalytic step I spliceosome.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "537-545", "volume" "359", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29301961}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006396", "name" "RNA processing", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005737", "name" "cytoplasm", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008111", "name" "RNA-binding motif protein 8", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
