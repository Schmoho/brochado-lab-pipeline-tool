{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the sugar isomerase enzymes ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B (RpiB), galactose isomerase subunit A (LacA) and galactose isomerase subunit B (LacB).</p>\r\n<p>Galactose-6-phosphate isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.26]) is a heteromultimeric protein consisting of subunits LacA and LacB, and catalyses the conversion of D-galactose 6-phosphate to D-tagatose and 6-phosphate in the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway of lactose catabolism [[cite:PUB00002200]]. Galactose-6-phosphate isomerase is induced by galactose or lactose.</p>\r\n<p>Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.6]) forms a homodimer and catalyses the interconversion of D-ribose 5-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. This reaction permits the synthesis of ribose from other sugars, as well as the recycling of sugars from nucleotide breakdown. Two unrelated enzymes can catalyse this reaction: RpiA (found in most organisms) and RpiB (found in some bacteria and eukaryotes). RpiB is also involved in metabolism of the rare sugar, allose, in addition to ribose sugars. The structures of RpiA and RpiB are distinct, RpiB having a Rossmann-type α/β/α sandwich topology [[cite:PUB00029142]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3he8", "name" "Structural study of Clostridium thermocellum Ribose-5-Phosphate Isomerase B"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036569", "name" "Sugar-phosphate isomerase, RpiB/LacA/LacB superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30345" "RIBOSE-5-PHOSPHATE ISOMERASE B"}, "pfam" {"PF02502" "Ribose/Galactose Isomerase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005384" "Sugar-phosphate isomerase, RpiB/LacA/LacB types"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00689" "RpiB/LacA/LacB family sugar-phosphate isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sugar-phosphate isomerase, RpiB/LacA/LacB family", "short" "RpiB_LacA_LacB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 111, "proteomes" 7324, "taxa" 28946, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41282, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31390}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1463", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1463"} {"accession" "GenProp1438", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1438"} {"accession" "GenProp1294", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1294"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
