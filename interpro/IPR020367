{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacteriophage T4 infection rapidly shuts down transcription in the host cell and any other phages that may be present. This is accomplished by specifically blocking transcription of cytosine-containing DNA. T4 is protected from this as its DNA contains a substituted base, hydroxymethylcytosine, in place of the usual cytosine. The Alc protein plays a key role in this process by unfolding the host genome and blocking transcription of cytosine-containing DNA [[cite:PUB00056236], [cite:PUB00056237]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17527" "Phage ALC protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Host transcription inhibitor Alc", "short" "Host_transcript_inhib_Alc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 47, "taxa" 781, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 562, "sets" 0, "proteins" 562, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020367", :literature {"PUB00056236" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kutter E" "Drivdahl R" "Rand K."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Identification and characterization of the alc gene product of bacteriophage T4.", "year" 1984, "raw_pages" "291-304", "volume" "108", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6389256}, "PUB00056237" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Snyder L" "Jorissen L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
