The NADH dehydrogenase I complex couples the redox reaction to proton translocation, and thus conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents subunit M of the NADH dehydrogenase I complex in cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts [[cite:PUB00045281]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36900" "NAD(P)H-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE SUBUNIT M, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "pfam" {"PF10664" "Cyanobacterial and plastid NDH-1 subunit M"}, "hamap" {"MF_01352" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit M [ndhM]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit M", "short" "NdhM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 430, "taxa" 2181, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1222, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 805}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
