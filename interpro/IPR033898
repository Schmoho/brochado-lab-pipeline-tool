{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The eukaryotic AC19 subunit (also known as RPAC2 in mammals and RPC19 in yeast) of RNA polymerase (RNAP) I and RNAP III is involved in the assembly of RNAP subunits [[cite:PUB00081608]]. RNAP is a large multi-subunit complex responsible for the synthesis of RNA. It is the principal enzyme of the transcription process, and is a final target in many regulatory pathways that control gene expression in all living cells. At least three distinct RNAP complexes are found in eukaryotic nuclei:  RNAP I, RNAP II, and RNAP III. RNAP I is responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA precursor, while RNAP III functions in the synthesis of 5S and tRNA [[cite:PUB00028105]]. The AC19 subunit is the equivalent of the RPB11 subunit of RNAP II [[cite:PUB00076664]]. The RPB11 subunit heterodimerizes with the RPB3 subunit, and together with RPB10 and RPB12, anchors the two largest subunits, RPB1 and RPB2, and stabilizes their association. The homology of AC19 to RPB11 suggests a similar function. The AC19 subunit is likely to associate with the RPB3 counterpart, AC40, to form a heterodimer, which stabilizes the association of the two largest subunits of RNAP I and RNAP III [[cite:PUB00081608], [cite:PUB00081609], [cite:PUB00081610]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036603", "name" "RNA polymerase, RBP11-like subunit", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07029" "AC19 subunit of Eukaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) I and RNAP III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerases I and III subunit AC19", "short" "RNAP_AC19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 85, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2457, "taxa" 8498, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3862, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3862, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2593}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033898", :literature {"PUB00081608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Vannini A" "Cramer P."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
