{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CarBb is the B subunit of 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase (CarB), which catalyzes the oxidization and subsequent ring-opening of 2-aminophenyl-2,3-diol. It is a key enzyme in the carbazole degradation pathway isolated from bacterial strains with carbazole degradation ability. The enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two A and two B subunits. CarB belongs to the class III extradiol dioxygenase family, a group of enzymes which use a non-heme Fe(II) to cleave aromatic rings between a hydroxylated carbon and an adjacent non-hydroxylated carbon. Although the enzyme was originally isolated as a meta-cleavage enzyme for 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol involved in carbazole degradation, it has also shown high specificity for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl [[cite:PUB00015248], [cite:PUB00084667]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07367" "CarBb is the B subunit of the Class III Extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase, 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidization and subsequent ring-opening of 2-aminophenyl-2,3-diol"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol-1,2-dioxygenase, beta subunit", "short" "CarBb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 53, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034944", :literature {"PUB00084667" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Larentis AL" "Almeida RV" "Rossle SC" "Cardoso AM" "Almeida WI" "Bisch PM" "Alves TL" "Martins OB."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Biochem.
