{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of alpha-1,2-specific exomannosidases that are involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), including EDEM1/2/3 from humans, Mnl1 from yeasts and MNS4/5 from Arabidopsis. Mnl1 forms a complex with Pdi1 to process unfolded protein-bound Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides to Man7GlcNAc2, promoting degradation in unfolded protein response [[cite:PUB00096761]]. In humans, mannose trimming from Man8GlcNAc2 to Man7GlcNAc2 is performed mainly by EDEM3 and to a lesser extent by EDEM1, while EDEM2 catalyses the first mannose trimming step from Man9GlcNAc2 [[cite:PUB00086758]]. EDEM1 has been shown to recognise and deliver misfolded proteins to the SEL1L-containing ERAD complex [[cite:PUB00096762]]. MNS4/5 function in the formation of unique N-glycan structures that are specifically recognized by components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, which leads to the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00096763]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036026", "name" "Seven-hairpin glycosidases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012341", "name" "Six-hairpin glycosidase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45679" "ER DEGRADATION-ENHANCING ALPHA-MANNOSIDASE-LIKE PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein 1/2/3", "short" "EDEM1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2616, "taxa" 9081, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10374, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6579}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
