Both the F1 and F0 complexes are rotary motors that are coupled back-to-back. In the F1 complex, the central gamma subunit forms the rotor inside the cylinder made of the α(3)β(3) subunits, while in the F0 complex, the ring-shaped C subunits forms the rotor. The two rotors rotate in opposite directions, but the F0 rotor is usually stronger, using the force from the proton gradient to push the F1 rotor in reverse in order to drive ATP synthesis  [[cite:PUB00009752]]. These ATPases can also work in reverse in bacteria, hydrolysing ATP to create a proton gradient.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit A (or subunit 6) found in the F0 complex of F-ATPases. This subunit is a key component of the proton channel, and may play a direct role in the translocation of protons across the membrane. Catalysis in the F1 complex depends upon the rotation of the central stalk and F0 c-ring, which in turn is driven by the flux of protons through the membrane via the interface between the F0 c-ring and subunit A. The peripheral stalk links subunit A to the external surface of the F1 domain, and is thought to act as a stator to counter the tendency of subunit A and the F1 α(3)β(3) catalytic portion to rotate with the central rotary element\r\n[[cite:PUB00020607]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035908", "name" "ATP synthase, F0 complex, subunit A superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01393" "ATP synthase subunit a [atpB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01131" "F0F1 ATP synthase subunit A"}, "pfam" {"PF00119" "ATP synthase A chain"}, "prints" {"PR00123" "ATPASEA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP synthase, F0 complex, subunit A", "short" "ATP_synth_F0_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 210, "domain_architectures" 104, "proteomes" 9494, "taxa" 100980, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 99355, "sets" 0, "proteins" 98896, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 80335}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00420", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00420"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0128", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0128"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000568", :literature {"PUB00068789" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Radax C" "Sigurdsson O" "Hreggvidsson GO" "Aichinger N" "Gruber C" "Kristjansson JK" "Stan-Lotter H."], "ISO_journal" "Syst.
