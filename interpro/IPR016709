{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes HadA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv0636, [swissprot:P9WFK1]), HadA from Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (MSMEG_1340, [swissprot:A0QS40]) and other bacterial proteins from the UPF0336 family. HadA is a component of the beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadAB complex. It adopts a hotdog fold with a central β-sheet, which is twisted to form a concave cavity at the centre where a long α-helix is embedded, and some additional α-helices [[cite:PUB00100977], [cite:PUB00100976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4rlj", "name" "Crystal Structure of (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadAB hetero-dimer from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029069", "name" "HotDog domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00799" "UPF0336 protein <locus_tag>"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018072" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP018072 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dehydratase subunit HadA-like", "short" "HadA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2015, "taxa" 6405, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7520, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7457, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5940}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016709", :literature {"PUB00100976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Biswas R" "Dutta A" "Dutta D" "Hazra D" "Banerjee DR" "Basak A" "Das AK."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "Crystal structure of dehydratase component HadAB complex of mycobacterial FAS-II pathway.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "369-74", "volume" "458", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25656575}, "PUB00100977" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Dong Y" "Qiu X" "Shaw N" "Xu Y" "Sun Y" "Li X" "Li J" "Rao Z."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Cell", "title" "Molecular basis for the inhibition of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadAB complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis by flavonoid inhibitors.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "504-17", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26081470}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016709", "name" "Dehydratase subunit HadA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
