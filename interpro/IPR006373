{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Malaria is still a major cause of mortality in many areas of the world. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe human form of the disease and is responsible for most fatalities. Severe cases of malaria can occur when the parasite invades and then proliferates within red blood cell erythrocytes. The parasite produces many variant antigenic proteins, encoded by multigene families, which are present on the surface of the infected erythrocyte and play important roles in virulence. A crucial survival mechanism for the malaria parasite is its ability to evade the immune response by switching these variant surface antigens. The high virulence of P. falciparum relative to other malarial parasites is in large part due to the fact that in this organism many of these surface antigens mediate the binding of infected erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium (cytoadherence) and non-infected erythrocytes (rosetting). This can lead to the accumulation of infected cells in the vasculature of a variety of organs, blocking the blood flow and reducing the oxygen supply. Clinical symptoms of severe infection can include fever, progressive anaemia, multi-organ dysfunction and coma.

This is the largest variant surface antigen family in Plasmodium falciparum, with roughly 150 genes present in the genome of this parasite [[cite:PUB00033903]]. Rifins have a fundamental role in the development of severe malaria [[cite:PUB00085063]]. They are strongly immunogenic and high levels of anti-rifin antibodies are correlated with rapid parasite clearance and asymptomatic infections [[cite:PUB00033904]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>All RIFIN sequences contain the PEXEL motif (a pentameric sequence RxLxE/Q/D, known as the Plasmodium export element) required for correct export and surface expression or host-targeting (HT) signal which plays a central role in the export of proteins into the host cell [[cite:PUB00085061]]. It has been reported that PEXEL is preferably located 15-20 amino acids downstream of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence [[cite:PUB00085062]]. The RIFIN protein family can be divided into A and B types based on the presence or absence of a 25 amino acid motif located approximately 66 amino acids downstream of the PEXEL motif [[cite:PUB00085062]], with A- and B-types serving different roles in distinct parasite stages [[cite:PUB00085061]]. The specific type B RIFIN variant (PF13_0006) is expressed on the surface of free merozoites, internally in developing gametocytes and on the surface of gametes at the point of emerging from activated, mature stage V gametocytes. While type A RIFIN are expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface, potentially contributing to the antigenic variation capacity of the parasite [[cite:PUB00085061]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02009" "Rifin"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01477" "variant surface antigen, rifin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Variant surface antigen Rifin", "short" "VSA_Rifin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 41, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4243, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4092, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4049}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006373", :literature {"PUB00033900" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chen Q" "Schlichtherle M" "Wahlgren M."], "ISO_journal" "Clin.
