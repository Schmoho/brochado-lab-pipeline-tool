They are glycosyltransferases with a proposed role in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in a four component glycosylation pathway that is functionally conserved between nematodes and insects and that it is involved in resistance to bacterial toxins [[cite:PUB00156064], [cite:PUB00064256]]. Bre-3 is involved in susceptibility to pore-forming crystal toxins in conjunction with bre-1, bre-2, bre-4 and bre-5 [[cite:PUB00156064], [cite:PUB00064256]] and it is also involved in resistance to the nematotoxic C. cinerea galectin Cgl2 [[cite:PUB00056482]].
