{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the oxidative cyclase responsible for forming the distinctive E-ring of the chlorin ring system under aerobic conditions [[cite:PUB00011279]].  This enzyme is believed to utilise a binuclear iron centre and molecular oxygen.  There are two isoforms of this enzyme in some plants and cyanobacteria, which are differentially regulated based on the levels of copper and oxygen [[cite:PUB00015567], [cite:PUB00015568]].  This step is essential in the biosynthesis of both bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll under aerobic conditions (a separate enzyme, BchE, acts under anaerobic conditions).  This enzyme is found in plants, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRD1 (AcsF) is required for the maintenance of photosystem I and its associated light-harvesting complexes in copper-deficient (-Cu) and oxygen-deficient (-O(2)) Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells and is localised to the thylakoid membrane. The family also contains the Rhodocyclus gelatinosus (Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa or Rubrivivax gelatinosus) AcsF protein, which codes for a conserved, putative binuclear iron-cluster-containing protein involved in aerobic oxidative cyclization of Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester. AcsF and homologs have a leucine zipper and two copies of the conserved glutamate and histidine residues predicted to act as ligands for iron in the Ex(29-35)DExRH motifs. Several homologs of AcsF are found in a wide range of photosynthetic organisms, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Crd1 and Pharbitis nil PNZIP, suggesting that this aerobic oxidative cyclization mechanism is conserved from bacteria to plants [[cite:PUB00011279]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01047" "Aerobic Cyclase System Fe-containing subunit (ACSF), ferritin-like diiron-binding domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR31053" "MAGNESIUM-PROTOPORPHYRIN IX MONOMETHYL ESTER [OXIDATIVE] CYCLASE, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "hamap" {"MF_01840" "Aerobic magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester [oxidative] cyclase [acsF]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02029" "magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (oxidative) cyclase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester [oxidative] cyclase", "short" "AcsF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 834, "taxa" 5120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3963, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3958, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3000}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0144", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0144"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
