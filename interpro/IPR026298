{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and related proteins comprise the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-2 proteins are central regulators of caspase activation, and play a key role in cell death by regulating the integrity of the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes [[cite:PUB00017301]]. Though originally characterised with respect to their roles in controlling outer mitochondrial membrane integrity and apoptosis, the members of the Bcl-2 family are involved in numerous cellular pathways [[cite:PUB00060365]].</p>\n\n<p>Bcl-2 and its relatives are functionally classified as either antiapoptotic or proapoptotic. All members contain at least one of four conserved motifs, termed Bcl-2 Homology (BH) domains. Antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins contain four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-4). The major antiapoptotic proteins are Bcl-2-related gene A1 (A1), Bcl-2, Bcl-2-related gene, long isoform (Bcl-xL), Bcl-w, and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1). They preserve outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) integrity by directly inhibiting the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [[cite:PUB00060365]].</p>\n\n<p>The proapoptotic Bcl-2 members are divided into the effector proteins and the BH3-only proteins. The effector proteins Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (BAK) and Bcl-2-associated x protein (BAX) were originally described to contain only BH1-3; however, structure-based alignments revealed a conserved BH4 motif [[cite:PUB00049899]]. Upon activation BAK and BAX homo-oligomerise into proteolipid pores within the OMM to promote MOMP (mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation). The BH3-only proteins function in distinct cellular stress scenarios and are subdivided based on their ability to interact with the antiapoptotic or both the antiapoptotic and the effector proteins [[cite:PUB00060365]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5fmi", "name" "Human Bak Q77L"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036834", "name" "Bcl-2-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06845" "Bcl-2_like"}, "prints" {"PR01862" "Apoptosis regulator, Bcl-2/Bcl-X/Bcl-W/Mc-1"}, "panther" {"PTHR11256" "BCL-2 RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bcl-2 family", "short" "Bcl-2_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 412, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 989, "taxa" 4108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9522, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6307}, "pathways" 46}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026298", :literature {"PUB00060365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chipuk JE" "Moldoveanu T" "Llambi F" "Parsons MJ" "Green DR."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
