{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of transcription regulators, including Fhl1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and FHA1 from plants. Most of the proteins in this entry contain the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is a phosphopeptide recognition domain found in many regulatory proteins. Fhl1 is a ribosomal protein (RP) transcription regulator that recruits coactivator Ifh1 or corepressor Crf1 to RP gene promoters [[cite:PUB00075001], [cite:PUB00098205]].</p>\n\n<p>Tobacco NtFHA1 consists of an N-terminal FHA domain and a C-terminal acidic region, but lacks a known DNA-binding motif. Its function in plants may be analogous to Fhl1 function in yeast [[cite:PUB00098206]]. There are two Arabidopsis homologues of FHA1, designated AtFHA1 (At3g07260) and AtFHA2 (At3g07220). Their function is not clear, however, they have differential expression patterns during plant development. AtFHA2 has been shown to regulate stamen development [[cite:PUB00098207]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21712" "PRE-RRNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN FHL1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription regulator Fhl1/FHA1", "short" "Fhl1/FHA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1177, "taxa" 3716, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2373, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1254}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045178", :literature {"PUB00098206" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Kim M" "Ahn JW" "Song K" "Paek KH" "Pai HS."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Forkhead-associated domains of the tobacco NtFHA1 transcription activator and the yeast Fhl1 forkhead transcription factor are functionally conserved.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "38781-90", "volume" "277", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12149245}, "PUB00098207" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ahn ER" "Cho HK" "Pai HS."], "ISO_journal" "Planta", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Planta", "title" "The forkhead-associated domain 2 (FHA2) in Arabidopsis plays a role in plant fertility by regulating stamen development.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1015-23", "volume" "237", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23192389}, "PUB00075001" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7020", "authors" ["Wade JT" "Hall DB" "Struhl K."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03175", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "The transcription factor Ifh1 is a key regulator of yeast ribosomal protein genes.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1054-8", "volume" "432", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15616568}, "PUB00098205" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rudra D" "Zhao Y" "Warner JR."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Central role of Ifh1p-Fhl1p interaction in the synthesis of yeast ribosomal proteins.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "533-42", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15692568}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0060962", "name" "regulation of ribosomal protein gene transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045178", "name" "Transcription regulator Fhl1/FHA1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
