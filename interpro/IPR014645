{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tom1 (target of Myb 1) and its related proteins (Tom1L1 and Tom1L2) constitute a protein family and share an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain followed by a GAT (GGA and Tom1) domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VHS domains are found at the N termini of select proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking and are often localized to membranes. The three dimensional structure of human TOM1 VHS domain reveals eight helices arranged in a superhelix. The surface of the domain has two main features: (1) a basic patch on one side due to several conserved positively charged residues on helix 3 and (2) a negatively charged ridge on the opposite side, formed by residues on helix 2 [[cite:PUB00008037]]. The basic patch is thought to mediate membrane binding.</p>\n\n<p>It was demonstrated that the GAT domain of both Tom1 and Tom1L1 binds ubiquitin, suggesting that these proteins might participate in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVB) [[cite:PUB00027951]]. Moreover, Tom1L1 interacts with members of the MVB sorting machinery. Specifically, the VHS domain of Tom1L1 interacts with Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate), whereas a PTAP motif, located between the VHS and GAT domains of Tom1L1, is responsible for binding to TSG101 (tumour susceptibility gene 101). Myc epitope-tagged Tom1L1 is recruited to endosomes following Hrs expression. In addition, Tom1L1 possesses several tyrosine motifs at the C-terminal region that mediate interactions with members of the Src family kinases and other signalling proteins such as Grb2 and p85. Expression of a constitutively active form of Fyn kinase promotes the recruitment of Tom1L1 to enlarged endosomes. It is proposed that Tom1L1 could act as an intermediary between the signalling and degradative pathways [[cite:PUB00027927]].</p>\n\n<p>Over expression of Tom1 suppresses activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1, induced by either IL-1beta or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and the VHS domain of Tom1 is indispensable for this suppressive activity. This suggests that Tom1 is a common negative regulator of signalling pathways induced by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha [[cite:PUB00027977]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036948" "Target of Myb protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Target of Myb protein 1", "short" "TOM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1152, "taxa" 4610, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6424, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3560}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014645", :literature {"PUB00008037" {"URL" nil, "issue" "37", "authors" ["Misra S" "Beach BM" "Hurley JH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi0013546", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Structure of the VHS domain of human Tom1 (target of myb 1): insights into interactions with proteins and membranes.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "11282-90", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10985773}, "PUB00027951" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Yamakami M" "Yoshimori T" "Yokosawa H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
