Conserved residues of the MazG domain (at least three of the Glu residues, Asp, Lys and Arg), including those shown to be functionally important [[cite:PUB00013554]], are also conserved here. MazG protein of Thermotoga maritima has been shown to have both nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase and pyrophosphatase activities, while Escherichia coli MazG has only NTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity [[cite:PUB00013554], [cite:PUB00014610]].
