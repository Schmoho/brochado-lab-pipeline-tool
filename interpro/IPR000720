{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In vertebrates, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is a multifunctional protein found in secretory granules. The protein contains two enzymes, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL), that act sequentially to catalyse the alpha-amidation of neuroendocrine peptides [[cite:PUB00002655], [cite:PUB00003713]]:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><reaction>\r\npeptidylglycine + ascorbate + O<sub>2</sub> = peptidyl-(2-hydroxyglycine) + dehydroascorbate + H<sub>2</sub>O\r\n</reaction></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product is unstable and dismutates to glyoxylate and the corresponding desglycine peptide amide. The first step of the reaction is catalysed by peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), and is dependent on copper, ascorbate and molecular oxygen; peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL) catalyses the second step of the reaction [[cite:PUB00003713]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011042", "name" "Six-bladed beta-propeller, TolB-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00790" "PAMONOXGNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase/peptidyl-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase", "short" "PHM/PAL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 34, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 942, "taxa" 4190, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23893, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4447, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2818}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
