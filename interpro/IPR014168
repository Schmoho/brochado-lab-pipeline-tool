{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the inner membrane protein TolR, part of the TolR/TolQ complex that transduces energy from the proton-motive force, through TolA, to an outer membrane complex made up of TolB and Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein). The complex is recruited to cell division sites and is required to maintain outer membrane integrity; defects may cause a defect in the import of some organic compounds. TolR is related to MotB, the peptidoglycan (PG)-binding stator protein from the flagellum, suggesting it might serve a similar role in Tol-Pal [[cite:PUB00088398]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02801" "protein TolR"}, "hamap" {"MF_02203" "Tol-Pal system protein TolR [tolR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tol-Pal system protein TolR", "short" "Tol-Pal_TolR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2485, "taxa" 11031, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11520, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11520, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9082}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0542", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0542"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014168", :literature {"PUB00088398" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Wojdyla JA" "Cutts E" "Kaminska R" "Papadakos G" "Hopper JT" "Stansfeld PJ" "Staunton D" "Robinson CV" "Kleanthous C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
