{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Outer envelope protein 61 is involved in protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts. It is thought to act as chaperone docking proteins during post-translational protein translocation into the ER. It also implicated in chaperone-mediated targeting of proteins to chloroplasts, interacting specifically with chloroplast precursors to facilitate their delivery to the chloroplast translocase. The TPR region within this protein is essential for interaction with HSP70-1, and the linker domain is crucial for the selective recognition of chloroplast precursor complexes, distinguishing it from mitochondrial precursors [[cite:PUB00125593], [cite:PUB00155241]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48433" "OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 61-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Outer envelope protein 61", "short" "OEP61"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 1016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 786, "sets" 0, "proteins" 786, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 472}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053319", :literature {"PUB00125593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["von Loeffelholz O" "Kriechbaumer V" "Ewan RA" "Jonczyk R" "Lehmann S" "Young JC" "Abell BM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "OEP61 is a chaperone receptor at the plastid outer envelope.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "143-53", "volume" "438", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21612577}, "PUB00155241" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 21", "authors" ["Schweiger R" "Muller NC" "Schmitt MJ" "Soll J" "Schwenkert S."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.111054", "medline_journal" "J Cell Sci", "title" "AtTPR7 is a chaperone-docking protein of the Sec translocon in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "5196-207", "volume" "125", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22899711}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053319", "name" "Outer envelope protein 61", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
