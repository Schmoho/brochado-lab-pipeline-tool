{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family predominantly consists of bacterial versions of tRNA adenylyltransferases. tRNA nuceotidyltransferases are responsible for the synthesis or repair of the 3' terminal CCA sequence of tRNA molecules. They are encoded by essential genes in almost all organisms and add the three ribonucleotides C, C, and A to the 3' end of tRNAs in sequential order. Most members of this family contain an additional metal dependent phosphohydrolase domain (HD). Although the precise functional role of this domain is undetermined, the demonstration in Escherichia coli of 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase, 2'-nucleotidase, and phosphatase activities has led to the suggestion that it is involved in the repair of the CCA terminus [[cite:PUB00015862]].</p>\n\n<p>For additional information please see [[cite:PUB00013566], [cite:PUB00015829], [cite:PUB00007363], [cite:PUB00011196], [cite:PUB00005837]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01261" "Multifunctional CCA protein [cca]", "MF_01262" "CCA-adding enzyme [cca]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000813" "tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme), Proteobacteria type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, proteobacteria", "short" "CCA_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1775, "taxa" 8246, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9360, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7109}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
