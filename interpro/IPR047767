{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The yeast polymerase suppressor 1 (PSP1) protein partially suppresses mutations in DNA polymerases alpha and delta [[cite:PUB00010018]]. The C-terminal half of PSP1 contains a domain, which is also found in several hypothetical proteins from both eukaryotic (fungal) and prokaryotic sources, such as Bacillus subtilis YaaT protein (also known as RicT), which was first thought to play a significant role in phosphorelay during initiation of sporulation. However, YaaT/RicT belongs to a iron-sulfur containing regulatory complex that is conserved also in many non-sporulating species, together with homologs of YmcA (RicA) and YlbF (RicF) [[cite:PUB00106189], [cite:PUB00075458]]. It is possible that the yaaT protein is also related to DNA replication [[cite:PUB00052612]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43830" "PROTEIN PSP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PSP1-like", "short" "PSP1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4586, "taxa" 16457, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17994, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17994, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047767", :literature {"PUB00010018" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Formosa T" "Nittis T."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
