{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents carboxysome assembly proteins, including CsoS2 and S2B (also known as carboxysome shell proteins), which are alpha-carboxysome scaffold proteins required for alpha-carboxysome (Cb) assembly.

The N-terminal repeats of this intrinsically disordered protein bind simultaneously to both subunits of RuBisCO and minimally 2 N-terminal repeats are necessary for RuBisCO assembly into the Cb in vivo [[cite:PUB00096686]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b12", "name" "cryo-EM structure of carboxysomal mini-shell: icosahedral assembly from CsoS4A/1A and CsoS2 co-expression (T = 9)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12288" "Carboxysome shell peptide mid-region"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carboxysome assembly protein CsoS2/2B", "short" "CSOS2/2B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 124, "taxa" 687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 672, "sets" 0, "proteins" 459, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 373}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020990", :literature {"PUB00096687" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chaijarasphong T" "Nichols RJ" "Kortright KE" "Nixon CF" "Teng PK" "Oltrogge LM" "Savage DF."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting Mediates Expression of the α-Carboxysome.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "153-164", "volume" "428", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26608811}, "PUB00096685" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Cai F" "Dou Z" "Bernstein SL" "Leverenz R" "Williams EB" "Heinhorst S" "Shively J" "Cannon GC" "Kerfeld CA."], "ISO_journal" "Life (Basel)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Life (Basel)", "title" "Advances in Understanding Carboxysome Assembly in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus Implicate CsoS2 as a Critical Component.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1141-71", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25826651}, "PUB00096686" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Oltrogge LM" "Chaijarasphong T" "Chen AW" "Bolin ER" "Marqusee S" "Savage DF."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Struct Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Struct Mol Biol", "title" "Multivalent interactions between CsoS2 and Rubisco mediate α-carboxysome formation.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "281-287", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32123388}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0043886", "name" "structural constituent of carboxysome shell", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020990", "name" "Carboxysome assembly protein CsoS2/2B", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 195}}}
