{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Some Gram-negative animal enteropathogens express a specialised secretion system to directly \"inject\" exotoxins into the cytoplasm of host cells. The system is composed of structural proteins and exotoxin effectors; these are often encoded on large virulence plasmids or on the bacterial chromosome itself [[cite:PUB00007817]]. Members may be referred to as invasins, pathogenicity island effectors, and cell invasion proteins [[cite:PUB00007582]].</p>\n\n<p>The Shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigen (ipa) genes are found on such a plasmid, and are highly regulated [[cite:PUB00007818]]. Homologues of the ipa genes (SipC/SspC) have been found in Salmonella typhimurium [[cite:PUB00007582]], and both pathogens utilise their type III system to translocate their invasive effectors. SipB/SctE1 and SipC/SctB1 are inserted into the host membrane where they form a pore and allow the translocation of effector proteins into the cytosol of target cells [[cite:PUB00151516]]. These are responsible for interacting directly with the host eukaryotic cell. IpaC can activate cellular kinase activity once in the host cytoplasm, and thus promotes cellular uptake of S. flexneri [[cite:PUB00007819], [cite:PUB00151514]]. In addition, it has been found that SipC interacts with another Salmonella protein, SipA, to enhance its reorganisation of the host cell actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating cellular uptake of the Salmonella bacterium by the eukaryotic cell [[cite:PUB00007819]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09599" "Salmonella-Shigella invasin protein C (IpaC_SipC)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02101" "IpaC/SipC family type III secretion system effector"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Effector protein BipC/T3SS SctB", "short" "BipC/SctB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 478, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 621, "sets" 0, "proteins" 610, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 539}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005427", :literature {"PUB00007817" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Cornelis GR" "Van Gijsegem F."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
