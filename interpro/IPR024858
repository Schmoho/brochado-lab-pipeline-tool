{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of the golgin subfamily A were identified as Golgi auto-antigens [[cite:PUB00056681]]. They might be involved in maintaining cis-Golgi structure [[cite:PUB00056685]]. One of the members of this family, member 2 or GM130, is a specific interacting partner of the small GTPase Rab1b [[cite:PUB00056684]] and plays a key role in the disassembly and reassembly of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. GM130 is also involved in vesicle tethering and fusion at the cis-cisternae to facilitate transit between transport vesicles and the stacked cisternae. It interacts with GRASPs proteins, which mediate the stacking of Golgi cisternae [[cite:PUB00094634]]. Additionally, GM130 was localised to the spindle poles and regulates microtubule organization [[cite:PUB00094635]].</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, GM130 is comprised of six coiled-coil regions in the middle, a Golgi-targeting domain at the C terminus, and a p115-interacting motif at the N terminus [[cite:PUB00094658]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6k06", "name" "Crystal structure of Importin-alpha and phosphomimetic GM130"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10881" "GOLGIN SUBFAMILY A MEMBER-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Golgin subfamily A", "short" "Golgin_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 927, "taxa" 3698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3044, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3044, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1939}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024858", :literature {"PUB00056681" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Fritzler MJ" "Hamel JC" "Ochs RL" "Chan EK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
