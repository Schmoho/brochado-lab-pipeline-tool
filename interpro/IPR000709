{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Leu/Ile/Val/Thr- and Leu-binding proteins, which share a high degree of sequence similarity, are components of the leucine-specific transport system. This is one of two periplasmic binding protein-dependent systems in the high-affinity transport of branched-chain amino acids in bacteria \n[[cite:PUB00002417], [cite:PUB00003242], [cite:PUB00097187]]. A much weaker sequence relationship has been reported between the periplasmic binding proteins and the aliphatic amidase expression-regulating protein, AmiC. On this basis, it has been suggested that AmiC may be capable of adopting a similar 3D fold [[cite:PUB00001238]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00337" "LEUILEVALBP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leu/Ile/Val-binding protein", "short" "Leu_Ile_Val-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 33, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3961, "taxa" 17200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 196803, "sets" 0, "proteins" 49120, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38116}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000709", :literature {"PUB00002417" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Landick R" "Oxender DL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
