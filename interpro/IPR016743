{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nuclear factor interleukin-3-regulated protein (NFIL3, also known as E4BP4) was first identified as a transcriptional repressor capable of binding an activating transcription factor (ATF) DNA consensus sequence site in the adenovirus E4 promoter [[cite:PUB00012641]]. Later, it was independently identified as a transactivator of the IL3 promoter in human T cells [[cite:PUB00071172]].</p>\n\n<p>E4BP4 is involved in a several biological processes, including transcriptional control of the circadian clock, neuron growth and survival, osteoblast function, and regulation of ovulation [[cite:PUB00071171]]. It is essential for the development of NK cells and CD8alpha(+) conventional dendritic cells, and is also involved in macrophage activation, polarisation of CD4(+) T cell responses and B cell class switching to IgE [[cite:PUB00071171]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF019029" "Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, E4BP4 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear factor interleukin-3-regulated protein", "short" "NFIL3/E4BP4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 202, "taxa" 745, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 237, "sets" 0, "proteins" 237, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 167}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016743", :literature {"PUB00071171" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Male V" "Nisoli I" "Gascoyne DM" "Brady HJ."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Immunol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2011.10.002", "medline_journal" "Trends Immunol", "title" "E4BP4: an unexpected player in the immune response.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "98-102", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22075207}, "PUB00012641" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Cowell IG" "Skinner A" "Hurst HC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
