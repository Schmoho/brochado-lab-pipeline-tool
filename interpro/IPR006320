{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) [[cite:PUB00003612], [cite:PUB00000073]] is a major carbohydrate transport system in bacteria. The PTS catalyses the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates and coupled with translocation across the cell membrane, makes the PTS a link between the uptake and metabolism of sugars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general mechanism of the PTS is the following: a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is transferred via a signal transduction pathway, to enzyme I (EI) which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier, the histidine protein (HPr). Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to a sugar-specific permease, a membrane-bound complex known as enzyme 2 (EII), which transports the sugar to the cell. EII consists of at least three structurally distinct domains IIA, IIB and IIC [[cite:PUB00002162]]. These can either be fused together in a single polypeptide chain or exist as two or three interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>These sequences, which are about 160 residues in length, are closely related to the fructose-specific phosphotransferase (PTS) system IIA component.
