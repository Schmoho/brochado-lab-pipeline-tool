{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eaf6 is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of selected genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A. The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex is conserved from yeast to humans [[cite:PUB00035439]]. Budding yeast Eaf6 is also a component of the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex that acetylates Lys-14 of histone H3 [[cite:PUB00041945]], while human Eaf6 is a component of the MOZ/MORF complex which has a histone H3 acetyltransferase activity [[cite:PUB00075219]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09340" "Histone acetyltransferase subunit NuA4"}, "panther" {"PTHR13476" "CHROMATIN MODIFICATION-RELATED PROTEIN MEAF6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromatin modification-related protein Eaf6", "short" "Eaf6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 60, "proteomes" 2459, "taxa" 8406, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4872, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4859, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3103}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015418", :literature {"PUB00035439" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Doyon Y" "Selleck W" "Lane WS" "Tan S" "Cote J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
