{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pancreatic ribonucleases (RNaseA) are pyrimidine-specific endonucleases found in high quantity in the pancreas of certain mammals and of some reptiles [[cite:PUB00001546]]. Specifically, the enzymes are involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of 3'-phosphomononucleotides and 3'-phosphooligonucleotides ending in C-P or U-P with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate intermediates. Ribonuclease can unwind the DNA helix by complexing with single-stranded DNA; the complex arises by an extended multi-site cation-anion interaction between lysine and arginine residues of the enzyme and phosphate groups of the nucleotides. Other proteins belonging to the pancreatic RNAse family include: bovine seminal vesicle and brain ribonucleases; kidney non-secretory ribonucleases [[cite:PUB00004682]]; liver-type ribonucleases [[cite:PUB00000315]]; angiogenin, which induces vascularisation of normal and malignant tissues; eosinophil cationic protein [[cite:PUB00003106]], a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with ribonuclease activity; and frog liver ribonuclease and frog sialic acid-binding lectin. The sequence of pancreatic RNases contains four conserved disulphide bonds and three amino acid residues involved in the catalytic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zpo", "name" "Crystal Structure of Green Turtle Egg White Ribonuclease"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036816", "name" "Ribonuclease A-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11437" "RIBONUCLEASE"}, "prints" {"PR00794" "RIBONUCLEASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pancreatic ribonuclease", "short" "RNaseA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 513, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 319, "taxa" 1655, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3921, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3821, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2603}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00118", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00118"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
