{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GTR1  was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) as a suppressor of a mutation in RCC1. RCC1 catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran, a well characterised nuclear Ras-like small G protein that plays an essential role in the import and export of proteins and RNAs across the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex. RCC1 is located inside the nucleus, bound to chromatin. The concentration of GTP within the cell is ~30 times higher than the concentration of GDP, thus resulting in the preferential production of the GTP form of Ran by RCC1 within the nucleus.</p>\n\n<p>Gtr1p is located within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and has been reported to play a role in cell growth. Biochemical analysis revealed that Gtr1 is in fact a G protein of the Ras family. The RagA/B proteins are the human homologues of Gtr1 and Rag A and Gtr1p belong to the sixth subfamily of the Ras-like small GTPase superfamily [[cite:PUB00007995]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3llu", "name" "Crystal structure of the nucleotide-binding domain of Ras-related GTP-binding protein C"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04670" "Gtr1/RagA G protein conserved region"}, "panther" {"PTHR11259" "RAS-RELATED GTP BINDING RAG/GTR YEAST"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gtr1/RagA G protein", "short" "Gtr1_RagA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 136, "proteomes" 2378, "taxa" 8253, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10284, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10063, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6931}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
