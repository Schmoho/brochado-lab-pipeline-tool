{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ABC-F proteins compose one of the most widely distributed branches of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. EttA/YjjK is the most prevalent eubacterial ABC-F protein. Its role consists in gating ribosome entry into the translation elongation cycle through a nucleotide-dependent interaction sensitive to ATP/ADP ratio [[cite:PUB00086945]]. The ATP-bound form of EttA binds to the ribosomal tRNA-exit site, and forms a bridge between the ribosomal L1 stalk and the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site [[cite:PUB00086976]]. EttA may regulate protein synthesis in energy-depleted cells, which have a low ATP/ADP ratio.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00847" "Energy-dependent translational throttle protein EttA [ettA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03719" "energy-dependent translational throttle protein EttA"}, "panther" {"PTHR43858" "ENERGY-DEPENDENT TRANSLATIONAL THROTTLE PROTEIN ETTA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Energy-dependent translational throttle protein EttA", "short" "EttA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6432, "taxa" 23279, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26276, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26276, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20109}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
