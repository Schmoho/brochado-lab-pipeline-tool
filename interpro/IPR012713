{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chaperonins are cytosolic, ATP-dependent molecular chaperones, with a conserved toroidal architecture, that assist in the folding of nascent and/or denatured polypeptide chains. The group I chaperonin system consists of GroEL and GroES, and are found (usually) in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles. The group II chaperonin system, called the thermosome in archaea and TRiC or CCT in the Eukaryota, is structurally similar but only distantly related. Prefoldin, also called GimC, is a complex in archaea and eukaryota that works with group II chaperonins. Members of this protein family are the archaeal clade of the beta class of prefoldin subunit. Closely related, but outside the scope of this family are the eukaryotic beta-class prefoldin subunits, Gim-1,3,4 and 6. The alpha class prefoldin subunits are more distantly related [[cite:PUB00017756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zqm", "name" "Crystal structure of the prefoldin beta subunit from Thermococcus strain KS-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009053", "name" "Prefoldin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00307" "Prefoldin subunit beta [pfdB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02338" "prefoldin subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prefoldin subunit beta", "short" "PfdB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 304, "taxa" 2168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2658, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2197}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0246", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0246"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012713", :literature {"PUB00017756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Leroux MR" "Fandrich M" "Klunker D" "Siegers K" "Lupas AN" "Brown JR" "Schiebel E" "Dobson CM" "Hartl FU."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/18.23.6730", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "MtGimC, a novel archaeal chaperone related to the eukaryotic chaperonin cofactor GimC/prefoldin.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "6730-43", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10581246}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0051082", "name" "unfolded protein binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006457", "name" "protein folding", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016272", "name" "prefoldin complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002777", "name" "Prefoldin beta-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR012713", "name" "Prefoldin subunit beta", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016661", "name" "Prefoldin, subunit 4", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027235", "name" "Prefoldin subunit 2", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030482", "name" "p53 and DNA damage-regulated protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
