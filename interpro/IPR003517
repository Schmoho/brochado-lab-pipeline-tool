{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Three cysteine-rich proteins (also believed to be lipoproteins) make up the extracellular matrix of the Chlamydial outer membrane [[cite:PUB00009430]]. They are involved in the essential structural integrity of both the elementary body (EB) and recticulate body (RB) phase. As these bacteria lack the peptidoglycan layer common to most Gram-negative microbes, such proteins are highly important in the pathogenicity of the organism.</p>\n\n<p>The largest of these is the major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and constitutes around 60% of the total protein for the membrane [[cite:PUB00009438]]. OMP2 is the second largest, with a molecular mass of 58kDa, while the OMP3 protein is ~15kDa [[cite:PUB00009430]]. MOMP is believed to elicit the strongest immune response, and has recently been linked to heart disease through its sequence similarity to a murine heart-muscle specific alpha myosin [[cite:PUB00009439]].</p>\n\n<p>The OMP3 family plays a structural role in the outer membrane during the EB stage of the Chlamydial cell, and different biovars show a small, yet highly significant, change at peptide charge level [[cite:PUB00009430]]. Members of this family include Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01335" "CHLAMIDIAOM3"}, "pfam" {"PF03503" "Chlamydia cysteine-rich outer membrane protein 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine-rich outer membrane protein 3, Chlamydia", "short" "Cys-rich_OMP3_Chlamydia"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 39, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003517", :literature {"PUB00009430" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Allen JE" "Cerrone MC" "Beatty PR" "Stephens RS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
