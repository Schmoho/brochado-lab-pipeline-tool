{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transport ATPases can be lumped into four distinct types, P, F, V, and ABC. The transport ATPase field is paving the way for nanotechnology focused on nano-motors using the F-type ATPases (F(0)F(1)). When these ATPases are driven in reverse by a proton gradient, they have the capacity to interconvert electrochemical energy into mechanical energy and finally into chemical energy, which is conserved in the terminal bond of ATP [[cite:PUB00043510]].
