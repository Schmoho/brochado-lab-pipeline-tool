{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interleukin-20 (IL-20) belongs to the family of IL-10-related cytokines, which includes IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 and -26 [[cite:PUB00046044]]. IL-20 induces STAT activation through two types of receptor complex, one of which it shares with IL-19, indicating that their biological activities may overlap [[cite:PUB00027532]]. Both cytokines may play an important role in regulating the development and proper functioning of skin [[cite:PUB00027532]]. IL-20 has also been shown to promote endothelial cell tube formation, suggesting that it may be involved in vascular vessel maturation and remodelling [[cite:PUB00046072]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents interleukin-20.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01935" "Interleukin-20"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-20", "short" "IL-20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 66, "taxa" 303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 370, "sets" 0, "proteins" 133, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 84}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020442", :literature {"PUB00046044" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Fickenscher H" "Hor S" "Kupers H" "Knappe A" "Wittmann S" "Sticht H."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Immunol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1471-4906(01)02149-4", "medline_journal" "Trends Immunol", "title" "The interleukin-10 family of cytokines.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "89-96", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11929132}, "PUB00027532" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Chang C" "Magracheva E" "Kozlov S" "Fong S" "Tobin G" "Kotenko S" "Wlodawer A" "Zdanov A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
