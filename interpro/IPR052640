{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Gemin-5, a protein involved in the assembly and function of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential components of the spliceosome, the complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells [[cite:PUB00155015], [cite:PUB00103799]]. They recognise and bind to snRNAs and the 7-methylguanosine cap found on mRNA and snRNA molecules [[cite:PUB00155012], [cite:PUB00155013], [cite:PUB00155014]]. They are part of the SMN complex, facilitating the formation of the core snRNP by delivering snRNAs to the complex. Additionally, they may interact with ribosomes and play a role in the regulation of protein synthesis. In Drosophila, is also described as a nuclear receptor cofactor in ecdysone-regulated gene expression during molting and puparium formation [[cite:PUB00155010]] and it is essential in muscle and neuronal tissues for motor function, including climbing ability and flight [[cite:PUB00155011]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6rnq", "name" "Crystal structure of the dimerization domain of Gemin5 at 1.95 A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46362" "GEM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gem-associated protein 5", "short" "Gemin-5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1040, "taxa" 4097, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2217, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2217, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 558}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052640", :literature {"PUB00155012" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Tang X" "Bharath SR" "Piao S" "Tan VQ" "Bowler MW" "Song H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2016.133", "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "Structural basis for specific recognition of pre-snRNA by Gemin5.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1353-1356", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27834343}, "PUB00155014" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Jin W" "Wang Y" "Liu CP" "Yang N" "Jin M" "Cong Y" "Wang M" "Xu RM."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.291377.116", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Structural basis for snRNA recognition by the double-WD40 repeat domain of Gemin5.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "2391-2403", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27881601}, "PUB00103799" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Matera AG" "Raimer AC" "Schmidt CA" "Kelly JA" "Droby GN" "Baillat D" "Ten Have S" "Lamond AI" "Wagner EJ" "Gray KM."], "ISO_journal" "G3 (Bethesda)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "G3 (Bethesda)", "title" "Composition of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) Complex in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "491-503", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30563832}, "PUB00155010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gates J" "Lam G" "Ortiz JA" "Losson R" "Thummel CS."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.00920", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "rigor mortis encodes a novel nuclear receptor interacting protein required for ecdysone signaling during Drosophila larval development.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "25-36", "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14645129}, "PUB00155015" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kour S" "Rajan DS" "Fortuna TR" "Anderson EN" "Ward C" "Lee Y" "Lee S" "Shin YB" "Chae JH" "Choi M" "Siquier K" "Cantagrel V" "Amiel J" "Stolerman ES" "Barnett SS" "Cousin MA" "Castro D" "McDonald K" "Kirmse B" "Nemeth AH" "Rajasundaram D" "Innes AM" "Lynch D" "Frosk P" "Collins A" "Gibbons M" "Yang M" "Desguerre I" "Boddaert N" "Gitiaux C" "Rydning SL" "Selmer KK" "Urreizti R" "Garcia-Oguiza A" "Osorio AN" "Verdura E" "Pujol A" "McCurry HR" "Landers JE" "Agnihotri S" "Andriescu EC" "Moody SB" "Phornphutkul C" "Sacoto MJG" "Begtrup A" "Houlden H" "Kirschner J" "Schorling D" "Rudnik-Schoneborn S" "Strom TM" "Leiz S" "Juliette K" "Richardson R" "Yang Y" "Zhang Y" "Wang M" "Wang J" "Wang X" "Platzer K" "Donkervoort S" "Bonnemann CG" "Wagner M" "Issa MY" "Elbendary HM" "Stanley V" "Maroofian R" "Gleeson JG" "Zaki MS" "Senderek J" "Pandey UB."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22627-w", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Loss of function mutations in GEMIN5 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "2558", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33963192}, "PUB00155013" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Xu C" "Ishikawa H" "Izumikawa K" "Li L" "He H" "Nobe Y" "Yamauchi Y" "Shahjee HM" "Wu XH" "Yu YT" "Isobe T" "Takahashi N" "Min J."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.288340.116", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Structural insights into Gemin5-guided selection of pre-snRNAs for snRNP assembly.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "2376-2390", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27881600}, "PUB00155011" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Borg R" "Cauchi RJ."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083878", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "The Gemin associates of survival motor neuron are required for motor function in Drosophila.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e83878", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24391840}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR052640", "name" "Gem-associated protein 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
