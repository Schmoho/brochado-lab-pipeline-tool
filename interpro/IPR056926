{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Fluoroquinolones export permease protein family, which is involved in the export of fluoroquinolones as part of an ABC transporter complex. This family is likely responsible for the translocation of substrates across the membrane and confers resistance to various fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, and sparfloxacin. A member of this family, Fluoroquinolones export permease protein Rv2687c ([swissprot:P9WJB1]), is part of the ABC transporter complex Rv2686c/Rv2687c/Rv2688c involved in fluoroquinolones export and confers resistance to ciprofloxacin [[cite:PUB00160012]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24686" "Fluoroquinolones export permease protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fluoroquinolones export permease", "short" "FLQE3_permease"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 222, "taxa" 1345, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 912, "sets" 0, "proteins" 912, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 682}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056926", :literature {"PUB00160012" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Pasca MR" "Guglierame P" "Arcesi F" "Bellinzoni M" "De Rossi E" "Riccardi G."], "ISO_journal" "Antimicrob Agents Chemother", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.48.8.3175-3178.2004", "medline_journal" "Antimicrob Agents Chemother", "title" "Rv2686c-Rv2687c-Rv2688c, an ABC fluoroquinolone efflux pump in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "3175-8", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15273144}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056926", "name" "Fluoroquinolones export permease", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 30, "alignment:full" 236}}}
