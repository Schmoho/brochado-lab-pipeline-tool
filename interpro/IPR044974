Resistance to a pathogen is manifested in several ways and is often correlated with a hypersensitive response (HR), localised induced cell death in the host plant at the site of infection [[cite:PUB00005204], [cite:PUB00097509]]. The induction of the plant defence response that leads to HR is initiated by the plants recognition of specific signal molecules (elicitors) produced by the pathogen; R genes are thought to encode receptors for these elicitors.
