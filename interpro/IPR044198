{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein DEK is an abundant and ubiquitous chromatin protein in multicellular organisms (not in yeast) [[cite:PUB00095487], [cite:PUB00095488]]. It preferentially binds to superhelical and cruciform DNA, and induces positive supercoils into closed circular DNA [[cite:PUB00095563]]. This protein has two DNA binding domains, the SAP/SAF box located at the centre of the protein, and the second one at the C-terminal, which contains several phosphorylation sites important for its activity. It is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis, being associated with cancers and autoimmune diseases and a possible therapeutic drug target [[cite:PUB00095488]]. In humans DEK can be secreted by macrophages,  and the secreted DEK regulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells through CXCR2 signaling [[cite:PUB00095565]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13468" "DEK PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein DEK", "short" "DEK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1255, "taxa" 5066, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4079, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4079, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2509}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044198", :literature {"PUB00095488" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Sanden C" "Gullberg U."], "ISO_journal" "Leukemia", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Leukemia", "title" "The DEK oncoprotein and its emerging roles in gene regulation.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1632-6", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25765544}, "PUB00095487" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Hu HG" "Scholten I" "Gruss C" "Knippers R."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
