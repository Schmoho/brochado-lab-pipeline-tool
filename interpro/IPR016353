{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the chordin family. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are expressed during osteogenesis and their action is regulated by corresponding BMP inhibitors. Chordin, a BMP inhibitor, as well as BMP-2, is expressed during osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. Chordin increases BMP-2 bioavailability. The potential of suppressing BMP inhibitors is emerging as a biological therapeutic target in bone tissue engineering [[cite:PUB00044124]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002496" "Chordin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chordin", "short" "Chordin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 429, "taxa" 2146, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1123, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 635}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016353", :literature {"PUB00044124" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Heliotis M" "Tsiridis E."], "ISO_journal" "Arthritis Res.
