{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a redox-responsive histidine kinase, RegB/PrrB, found in alphaproteobacteria, which shows strong sequence conservation, including the notable motif [VA]AAAAHELGTPxTI. It always acts as a partner to an ActR/PrrA/RegA family global response regulator transcription factor in a two-component sensory transduction system. Lineage-specific names and gene symbols given to this histidine kinase reflect downstream regulator changes such as entry into stationary phase, anaerobic expression of photosynthesis genes, and survival of exposure to low pH [[cite:PUB00105328], [cite:PUB00105329], [cite:PUB00011207]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033792" "ActS/PrrB/RegB family redox-sensitive histidine kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sensor histidine kinase RegB", "short" "RegB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1009, "taxa" 3254, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3270, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3270, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2533}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
