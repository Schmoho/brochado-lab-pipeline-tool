{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aminopeptidase O (MEROPS identifier M01.028) is an intracellular aminopeptidase. There is a nucleolar location signal located between the peptidase and ARM-repeat domains. Aminopeptidase O has been localized to the nucleolus, and in the mouse a shorter isoform, generated by alternative initiation, is found in adult and embryonic blood vessels, mainly in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells [[cite:PUB00079146]]. The AOPEP gene also includes a cluster of microRNAs, one of which modulates expression of the Mef2c gene which encodes myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C [[cite:PUB00079147]]. It is possible that aminopeptidase O is involved in development of vasculature in the embryo and control of blood pressure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46627" "AMINOPEPTIDASE O"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminopeptidase O", "short" "AOPep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 591, "taxa" 2257, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 868}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
