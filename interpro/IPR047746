{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents cell wall amidases, including domesticated amidase effector 2 (Dae2) from ticks and type VI amidase effector 2 (Tae2, also known as BTH_I0068 [swissprot:Q2T2K7]) from bacteria [[cite:PUB00151052], [cite:PUB00151054]]. \nDae2  has been horizontally acquired from bacteria and has structurally and biochemically diverged from its ancestral bacterial counterparts, leading to broadened antimicrobial specificity [[cite:PUB00151052], [cite:PUB00151053]].</p>\n\n<p>Dae2 is a gut and saliva antibacterial peptide that directly antagonizes host skin commensals which enter the ticks during feeding [[cite:PUB00151052]]. It acts as a cell wall hydrolase that cleaves the bond between gamma-D-glutamate-meso-diaminopimelate of a peptide stem and D-alanine of another peptide stem in peptidoglycans [[cite:PUB00151053]].</p>\n\n<p>These proteins are predicted to fold into an open Î²-barrel with SH3-like topology.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033857" "BPSL0067 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell wall amidase Dae2/Tae2-like", "short" "Dae2/Tae2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 112, "taxa" 925, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 854, "sets" 0, "proteins" 847, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 677}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047746", :literature {"PUB00151054" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Russell AB" "Singh P" "Brittnacher M" "Bui NK" "Hood RD" "Carl MA" "Agnello DM" "Schwarz S" "Goodlett DR" "Vollmer W" "Mougous JD."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "A widespread bacterial type VI secretion effector superfamily identified using a heuristic approach.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "538-49", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22607806}, "PUB00151052" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hayes BM" "Radkov AD" "Yarza F" "Flores S" "Kim J" "Zhao Z" "Lexa KW" "Marnin L" "Biboy J" "Bowcut V" "Vollmer W" "Pedra JHF" "Chou S."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Ticks Resist Skin Commensals with Immune Factor of Bacterial Origin.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1562-1571.e12", "volume" "183", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33306955}, "PUB00151053" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7537", "authors" ["Chou S" "Daugherty MD" "Peterson SB" "Biboy J" "Yang Y" "Jutras BL" "Fritz-Laylin LK" "Ferrin MA" "Harding BN" "Jacobs-Wagner C" "Yang XF" "Vollmer W" "Malik HS" "Mougous JD."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Transferred interbacterial antagonism genes augment eukaryotic innate immune function.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "98-101", "volume" "518", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25470067}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047746", "name" "Cell wall amidase Dae2/Tae2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
