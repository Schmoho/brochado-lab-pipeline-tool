{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes FERM domain-containing protein 6 (FRMD6, also known as willin and hEx/human expanded), its homologue from Drosophila, Expanded (Ex) and FERM domain-containing protein 1 (FRMD1). Ex, is a regulator of the Hippo/SWH (Sav/Wts/Hpo) signalling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in organ size control and is tumour suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis [[cite:PUB00063833], [cite:PUB00102020]]. Human FRMD6 was first thought to function independently of the Hippo pathway as it lacks the C-terminal domain of Ex that allows it to directly interact with various downstream Hippo signalling components [[cite:PUB00091828], [cite:PUB00102021]]. However, it has been shown to act as an upstream regulator of Hippo signalling that modulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics and mechanical phenotype of neuronal cells through ERK signalling [[cite:PUB00102021]]. FRMD6 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types; in the nervous system is involved in neuronal differentiation, myelination, nerve injury repair, and vesicle exocytosis. It has been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [[cite:PUB00091829]] and positioned as a novel AD risk gene [[cite:PUB00102021]].</p>\n\n<p>There is not much information about FRMD1 to date. Both FRMD1 and FRMD6 contain a single FERM domain, which is found in the cytoskeletal-associated proteins such as ezrin, moesin, radixin, 4.1R, and merlin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13429" "FERM DOMAIN (PROTEIN4.1-EZRIN-RADIXIN-MOESIN) FAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FERM domain-containing protein 6-like", "short" "FRMD6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 951, "taxa" 3729, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2749, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2749, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1708}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047145", :literature {"PUB00102020" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hu L" "Xu J" "Yin MX" "Zhang L" "Lu Y" "Wu W" "Xue Z" "Ho MS" "Gao G" "Zhao Y" "Zhang L."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Discov", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Discov", "title" "Ack promotes tissue growth via phosphorylation and suppression of the Hippo pathway component Expanded.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "15047", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27462444}, "PUB00091828" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Visser-Grieve S" "Hao Y" "Yang X."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2011.318", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Human homolog of Drosophila expanded, hEx, functions as a putative tumor suppressor in human cancer cell lines independently of the Hippo pathway.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1189-95", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21785462}, "PUB00063833" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yu J" "Zheng Y" "Dong J" "Klusza S" "Deng WM" "Pan D."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
