{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Neuromedin S (NmS) is a neuromedin U-related peptide. It has shown to possess anorexigenic and circadian rhythm-modulating properties in mammals. NmS expression is localised predominantly in the core region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus within the hypothalamus, but also in spleen and testis [[cite:PUB00093812]]. Other biological functions include antidiuretic action via release of vasopressin, milk ejection via release of oxytocin and regulation of the circulatory system, immune reactions and insulin secretion. NmU (neuromedin U) and NmS are involved in thermoregulation via the sympathetic nervous system (beta3 adrenergic receptors) and prostaglandin E2 [[cite:PUB00093813]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32414" "NEUROMEDIN-S"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuromedin S", "short" "NmS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 199, "taxa" 926, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 362, "sets" 0, "proteins" 362, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 211}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043253", :literature {"PUB00093813" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Nakahara K" "Akagi A" "Shimizu S" "Tateno S" "Qattali AW" "Mori K" "Miyazato M" "Kangawa K" "Murakami N."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
