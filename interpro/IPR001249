{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this family are a component of the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase complex ([ec:6.4.1.2]) and are involved in the first step in long-chain fatty acid synthesis. In plants this is usually located in the chloroplast. In the first step, biotin carboxylase catalyses the carboxylation of the carrier protein to form an intermediate. Next, the transcarboxylase complex transfers the carboxyl group from the intermediate to acetyl-CoA forming malonyl-CoA. This protein functions in the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub>from one site to another, the biotin binding site locates to the C-terminal of this protein. The biotin is specifically attached to a lysine residue in the sequence AMKM.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of the C-terminal domain of the biotin carboxyl carrier (BCC) protein was shown to be a flattened β-barrel structure comprising two four-stranded β sheets interrupted by a structural loop forming a thumb structure. The biotinyl-lysine is located on a tight β-turn on the opposite end of the molecule. The thumb structure has been shown to attached biotin, thus stabilising the structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1bdo", "name" "STRUCTURE OF THE BIOTINYL DOMAIN OF ACETYL-COENZYME A CARBOXYLASE DETERMINED BY MAD PHASING"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00531" "acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxyl carrier protein"}, "prints" {"PR01071" "ACOABIOTINCC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetyl-CoA biotin carboxyl carrier", "short" "AcCoA_biotinCC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6836, "taxa" 27577, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43440, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33098, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25409}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1111", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1111"} {"accession" "GenProp0214", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0214"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001249", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003989", "name" "acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006633", "name" "fatty acid biosynthetic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009317", "name" "acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001249", "name" "Acetyl-CoA biotin carboxyl carrier", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
