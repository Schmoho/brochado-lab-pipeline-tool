{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CPEB family members are RNA-binding proteins that are essential regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression. CPEBs target mRNAs defined by a cis-acting sequence in their 3' untranslated region (UTR), known as cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE; with a consensus sequence of UUUUUAU). They are indirectly responsible for both translational repression and translational activation by polyadenylation [[cite:PUB00084461]]. They are involved in may biological processes such as cell proliferation, senescence, cell polarity, and synaptic plasticity [[cite:PUB00084462]]. They regulate the translation of maternal mRNAs controlling meiotic cell cycle progression. Mammals have four CPEBs, CPEB1-4, among which CPEB1/2/4 are essential to successful mitotic cell division [[cite:PUB00084463]]. All four paralogues have two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a zinc-binding domain (ZZ domain).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drosophila CPEB homologue is known as Orb2, which may have a role in long-term memory formation [[cite:PUB00084464]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038446", "name" "CEBP, ZZ domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12566" "CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN CPEB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein", "short" "CPEB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1019, "taxa" 4059, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9159, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5834}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034819", :literature {"PUB00084461" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Richter JD."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
