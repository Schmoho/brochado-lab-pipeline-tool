{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of double-cubane proteins specific to anaerobes (facultative or obligate), including Putative dehydratase subunit YjiM from Escherichia coli and Putative dehydratase subunit MJ0007 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. These enzymes always co-occur with an accessory protein, an ATP-dependent activase. The cofactor contains a pair of 4Fe-4S cubane clusters, bridged by a sulfur atom, for an overall 8Fe-9S cofactor structure. Bacterial members of this protein family coexist with SelD, the selenium donor protein required for biosynthesis of selenoproteins, selenouridine-modified tRNAs, selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylases, and selenoneine [[cite:PUB00105953], [cite:PUB00105954], [cite:PUB00105933]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6eno", "name" "Double cubane cluster oxidoreductase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040772" "double-cubane-cluster-containing anaerobic reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dehydratase YjiM-like", "short" "YjiM-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 476, "taxa" 2577, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2670, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2112}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047678", :literature {"PUB00105933" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Gwadz M."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Eight Unexpected Selenoprotein Families in Organometallic Biochemistry in Clostridium difficile, in ABC Transport, and in Methylmercury Biosynthesis.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "e0025922", "volume" "205", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36598231}, "PUB00105953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Jeoung JH" "Dobbek H."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "ATP-dependent substrate reduction at an [Fe<sub>8</sub>S<sub>9</sub>] double-cubane cluster.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "2994-2999", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29507223}, "PUB00105954" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Jeoung JH" "Martins BM" "Dobbek H."], "ISO_journal" "Chembiochem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Chembiochem", "title" "Double-Cubane [8Fe9S] Clusters: A Novel Nitrogenase-Related Cofactor in Biology.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1710-1716", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32187824}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010327", "name" "FldB/FldC dehydratase alpha/beta subunit", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011955", "name" "Benzoyl-CoA reductase, subunit B", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011958", "name" "Benzoyl-CoA reductase, subunit C", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017603", "name" "Benzoyl-CoA reductase, bzd-type, N subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017604", "name" "Benzoyl-CoA reductase, bzd-type, O subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047678", "name" "Dehydratase YjiM-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
