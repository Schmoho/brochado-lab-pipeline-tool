{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mercury is a highly toxic metal. Toxicity can result from three different mercurial forms: elemental, inorganic ion and organomercurial compounds. The ability of bacteria to detoxify mercurial compounds by reduction and volatilisation is conferred by the Mer genes, which are usually plasmid encoded (although chromosome resistance determinants have also occasionally been identified) [[cite:PUB00010313]]. Organomercurial lyase (MerB), also known as alkylmercury lyase, mediates the first of the two steps in the microbial detoxification of organomercurial salts (the other catalysed by mercuric reductase).</p>\n\n<p>Organomercurial lyase catalyses the protonolysis of the C-Hg bond in a wide range of organomercurial salts (primary, secondary, tertiary, alkyl, vinyl, allyl and aryl) to Hg(II) and the respective organic compound [[cite:PUB00010357]]:</p>\n\n<p>RHg(+) + H(+) = RH + Hg(2+)</p>\n\n<p>Hg(II) is subsequently detoxified by mercuric reductase.</p>\n\n<p>The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity in Escherichia coli and has been found to be a 22.4kDa monomer with no detectable cofactors or metal ions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5c17", "name" "Crystal structure of the mercury-bound form of MerB2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053717", "name" "Mercury resistance MerB lyase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00714" "Alkylmercury lyase [merB]"}, "pfam" {"PF03243" "Alkylmercury lyase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001458" "Alkylmercury lyase"}, "prints" {"PR01699" "ORGNOHGLYASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alkylmercury lyase", "short" "MerB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 552, "taxa" 3167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3045, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2744, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2096}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0151", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0151"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
