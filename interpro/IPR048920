{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from Saccharomycetales, including Meiotic recombination protein REC102 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. REC102 protein is required for formation of the SPO11-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination. It may mediate the interaction between SPO11 subunits during meiosis [[cite:PUB00020805]]. It is also needed for homologue chromosome pairing, synaptonemal complex formation, and for the proper timing of the first meiotic division. It is not required for mitosis and mitotic DNA repair mechanisms.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21736" "REC102 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Meiotic recombination protein REC102", "short" "REC102"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 243, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 135, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 94}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048920", :literature {"PUB00020805" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kee K" "Keeney S."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11805049", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Functional interactions between SPO11 and REC102 during initiation of meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "111-22", "volume" "160", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11805049}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048920", "name" "Meiotic recombination protein REC102", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 37, "alignment:full" 65}}}
