{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (Mtases) are responsible for the transfer of methyl groups between two molecules. The transfer of the methyl group from the ubiquitous S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to nitrogen, oxygen or carbon atoms is frequently employed in diverse organisms. The reactions are catalysed by Mtases and modify DNA, RNA, proteins or small molecules, such as catechol, for regulatory purposes. Members of this family are predicted to be Mtases based on the crystal structure (1TO0) and its close structural homology to other structures (1VHK,1MXI,1IPA,1K3R) that have methyltransferase activity [[cite:PUB00016836]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ns5", "name" "X-RAY STRUCTURE OF YBEA FROM E.COLI.
