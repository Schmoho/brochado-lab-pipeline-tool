{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3-Dehydroquinate synthase ([ec:4.2.3.4]) is an enzyme in the common pathway of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis that catalyses the conversion of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) into 3-dehydroquinic acid [[cite:PUB00014826]]. This synthesis of aromatic amino acids is an essential metabolic function for most prokaryotic as well as lower eukaryotic cells, including plants. The pathway is absent in humans; therefore, DHQS represents a potential target for the development of novel and selective antimicrobial agents. Owing to the threat posed by the spread of pathogenic bacteria resistant to many currently used antimicrobial drugs, there is clearly a need to develop new anti-infective drugs acting at novel targets. A further potential use for DHQS inhibitors is as herbicides [[cite:PUB00014827]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33563" "PTHR33563"}, "hamap" {"MF_01244" "3-dehydroquinate synthase [aroB']"}, "pfam" {"PF01959" "3-dehydroquinate synthase II"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006655" "Predicted 3-dehydroquinate synthase, Methanopyrus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-dehydroquinate synthase", "short" "DHQ_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 24, "proteomes" 855, "taxa" 4254, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4280, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3349}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
