{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of animal proteins, including Pancreatic hormone [[cite:PUB00003973]], also known as Pancreatic polypeptide is a peptide (PP), which is synthesized in pancreatic islets of Langherhans and acts as a regulator of pancreatic and gastrointestinal functions.</p>\n\n<p>The hormone is produced as a larger propeptide, which is enzymatically cleaved to yield the mature active peptide: this is 36 amino acids in length [[cite:PUB00004634]] and has an amidated C terminus [[cite:PUB00001581]]. The hormone has a globular structure, residues 2-8 forming a left-handed poly-proline-II-like helix, residues 9-13 a β-turn, and 14-32 an α-helix, held close to the first helix by hydrophobic interactions [[cite:PUB00004634]]. Unlike glucagon, another peptide hormone, the structure of pancreatic peptide is preserved in aqueous solution [[cite:PUB00004503]]. Both N- and C- terminal ends are required for activity: receptor binding and activation functions may reside in the N and C termini respectively [[cite:PUB00004634]].</p>\n\n<p>Pancreatic hormone is part of a wider family of active peptides that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neuropeptide Y (NPY or melanostatin) [[cite:PUB00004634]], one of the most abundant peptides in the mammalian nervous system. NPY is implicated in the control of feeding and the secretion of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</li>\n<li>Peptide YY (PYY) [[cite:PUB00004595]]. PPY is a gut peptide that inhibits exocrine pancreatic secretion, has a vasoconstrictor action and inhibits jejunal and colonic mobility. Known as goannatyrotoxin-Vere1 in the venom of the pygmy desert monitor lizard (Varanus eremius) where it has a triphasic action: rapid biphasic hypertension followed by prolonged hypotension in prey animals [[cite:PUB00087298]].</li>\n<li>Various NPY and PYY-like polypeptides from fish and amphibians [[cite:PUB00001432], [cite:PUB00004504]].</li>\n<li>Neuropeptide F (NPF) from invertebrates such as worms and snail.</li>\n<li>Skin peptide Tyr-Tyr (SPYY) from the frog Phyllomedusa bicolor. SPYY shows a large spectra of antibacterial and antifungal activity.</li>\n<li>Polypeptide MY (peptide methionine-tyrosine). A regulatory peptide from the intestine of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) [[cite:PUB00087297]].</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All these peptides are 36 to 39 amino acids long. Like most active peptides, their C-terminal is amidated and they are synthesised as larger protein precursors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bf9", "name" "Anisotropic refinement of avian (turkey) pancreatic polypeptide at 0. 99 Angstroms resolution."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00126" "PAH"}, "smart" {"SM00309" "Pancreatic hormones / neuropeptide F / peptide YY family"}, "pfam" {"PF00159" "Pancreatic hormone peptide"}, "prints" {"PR00278" "PANCHORMONE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pancreatic hormone-like", "short" "Pancreatic_hormone-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 30, "proteomes" 761, "taxa" 3219, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2662, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2634, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1864}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00238", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00238"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001955", :literature {"PUB00004504" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Conlon JM" "Chartrel N" "Vaudry H."], "ISO_journal" "Peptides", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0196-9781(92)90154-U", "medline_journal" "Peptides", "title" "Primary structure of frog PYY: implications for the molecular evolution of the pancreatic polypeptide family.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "145-9", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1620652}, "PUB00087297" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Conlon JM" "Bjornholm B" "Jorgensen FS" "Youson JH" "Schwartz TW."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
