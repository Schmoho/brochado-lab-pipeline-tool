{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two types of proteins that hydrolyse inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), very different in both amino acid sequence and structure, have been characterised to date: soluble and membrane-bound proton-pumping pyrophosphatases (sPPases and H+)-PPases, respectively). sPPases are ubiquitous proteins that hydrolyse PPi to release heat, whereas H+-PPases, so far unidentified in animal and fungal cells, couple the energy of PPi hydrolysis to proton movement across biological membranes [[cite:PUB00014387]]. The latter type is represented by this group of proteins. H+-PPases ([ec:3.6.1.1]) are also called vacuolar-type inorganic pyrophosphatases (V-PPase) or pyrophosphate-energised vacuolar membrane proton pumps [[cite:PUB00014458]]. In plants, vacuoles contain two enzymes for acidifying the interior of the vacuole, the V-ATPase and the V-PPase (V is for vacuolar) [[cite:PUB00014387]]. In Arabidopsis, AVP1 contributes to H+-electrochemical potential difference between the citosol and vacuole lumen and also facilitates auxin transport by modulating apoplastic pH and regulates auxin-mediated developmental processes [[cite:PUB00097876]].</p>\n\n<p>Two distinct biochemical subclasses of H+-PPases have been characterised to date: K+-stimulated and K+-insensitive [[cite:PUB00014458]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31998" "K(+)-INSENSITIVE PYROPHOSPHATE-ENERGIZED PROTON PUMP"}, "hamap" {"MF_01129" "Putative K(+)-stimulated pyrophosphate-energized sodium pump [hppA]"}, "pfam" {"PF03030" "Inorganic H+ pyrophosphatase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001265" "H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01104" "V-type H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyrophosphate-energised proton pump", "short" "PPase-energised_H-pump"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 201, "proteomes" 5029, "taxa" 21020, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34656, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34256, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24778}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
