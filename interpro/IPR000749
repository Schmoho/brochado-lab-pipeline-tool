{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ATP:guanido phosphotransferases are a family of structurally and functionally related enzymes [[cite:PUB00002616], [cite:PUB00000670]] that reversibly catalyse the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens. The enzymes belonging to this family include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Glycocyamine kinase ([ec:2.7.3.1]), which catalyses the transfer of phosphate from ATP to guanidoacetate.</li>\n<li>Arginine kinase ([ec:2.7.3.3]), which catalyses the transfer of phosphate from ATP to arginine.</li>\n<li>Taurocyamine kinase ([ec:2.7.3.4]), an annelid-specific enzyme that catalyses the transfer of phosphate from ATP to taurocyamine. One member is Smc74, a cercaria-specific enzyme from Schistosoma mansoni [[cite:PUB00002616]].</li>\n<li>Lombricine kinase ([ec:2.7.3.5]), an annelid-specific enzyme that catalyses the transfer of phosphate from ATP to lombricine.</li>\n<li>Creatine kinase ([ec:2.7.3.2]) (CK) [[cite:PUB00000040], [cite:PUB00002619]], which catalyses the reversible transfer of high energy phosphate from ATP to creatine, generating phosphocreatine and ADP.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Creatine kinase plays an important role in energy metabolism of vertebrates. There are at least four different, but very closely related, forms of CK. Two isozymes, M (muscle) and B (brain), are cytosolic, while the other two are mitochondrial. In sea urchins there is a flagellar isozyme, which consists of the triplication of a CK-domain. A cysteine residue is implicated in the catalytic activity of these enzymes and the region around this active site residue is highly conserved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1m15", "name" "Transition state structure of arginine kinase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014746", "name" "Glutamine synthetase/guanido kinase, catalytic domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036802", "name" "ATP:guanido phosphotransferase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11547" "ARGININE OR CREATINE KINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP:guanido phosphotransferase", "short" "ATP-guanido_PTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2417, "taxa" 25488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18470}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00103", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00103"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
