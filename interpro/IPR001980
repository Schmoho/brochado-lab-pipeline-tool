{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT; [ec:2.7.7.3]) is an essential enzyme in bacteria, responsible for catalyzing the rate-limiting step in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis: catalysis of the reversible transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine to give dephospho-CoA (DPCOA) and pyrophosphate in the fourth (and penultimate) step of coenzyme A biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00015594]].  The dinucleotide-binding fold of PPAT is homologous to class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [[cite:PUB00036800], [cite:PUB00023529]]. CoA has been shown to inhibit PPAT and competes with ATP, PhP, and dPCoA. PPAT is a homohexamer in E. coli [[cite:PUB00000266], [cite:PUB00080721]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The enzyme had previously been thought to have a role in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00002701]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4r0n", "name" "Hexagonal form of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02163" "Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00151" "Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase [coaD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01510" "pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase"}, "prints" {"PR01020" "LPSBIOSNTHSS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase", "short" "PPAT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 116, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9098, "taxa" 34727, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41154, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40091, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30788}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0171", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0171"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
