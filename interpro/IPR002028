{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tryptophan synthase ([ec:4.2.1.20]) catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan [[cite:PUB00000116], [cite:PUB00000769]]:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>L-serine + 1-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate = L-tryptophan + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + H<sub>2</sub>O</reaction></p>\n\n<p>It has two functional domains, each found in bacteria and plants on a separate subunit. In Escherichia coli, the two subunits, A and B, are encoded by the trpA and trpB genes respectively. The alpha chain is for the aldol cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate to indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and the beta chain [interpro:IPR006653] is for the synthesis of tryptophan from indole and serine. In fungi the two domains are fused together in a single multifunctional protein, in the order: (NH2-A-B-COOH) [[cite:PUB00014824], [cite:PUB00004683]]. The two domains of the Neurospora crassa polypeptide are linked by a connector of 54-amino acid residues that has less than 25% identity to the 45-residue connector of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) polypeptide. Two acidic residues are believed to serve as proton donors/acceptors in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1geq", "name" "Entropic stabilization of the tryptophan synthase A-subunit from a hyperthermophile, pyrococcus furiosus: X-ray analysis and calorimetry"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04724" "Tryptophan_synthase_alpha"}, "panther" {"PTHR43406" "TRYPTOPHAN SYNTHASE, ALPHA CHAIN"}, "hamap" {"MF_00131" "Tryptophan synthase alpha chain [trpA]"}, "pfam" {"PF00290" "Tryptophan synthase alpha chain"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00262" "tryptophan synthase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tryptophan synthase, alpha chain", "short" "Trp_synthase_suA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 176, "domain_architectures" 89, "proteomes" 9913, "taxa" 37228, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32238}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00151", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00151"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1450", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1450"} {"accession" "GenProp0037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0037"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
