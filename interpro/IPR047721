{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins found in bacteria and some archaeal species, including DISARM protein DrmB from Bacillus paralicheniformis. DrmB is a component of anti-phage defence system DISARM (defense island system associated with restriction-modification), probably a multi-gene restriction module. This subunit has an unknown function. Expression of DISARM in B.subtilis confers resistance to several phages. This system does not interfere with phage adsorption, but instead interferes with viral DNA replication early in its cycle, preventing replication, circularisation and lysogeny and probably causes phage DNA degradation [[cite:PUB00105719]]. Many other members of this group show a MrfA-like Zn-binding domain ([interpro:IPR018973]) at the C-terminal end.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038324" "DrmB family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DISARM protein DrmB", "short" "DrmB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 685, "taxa" 3740, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2312, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1710}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047721", :literature {"PUB00105719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ofir G" "Melamed S" "Sberro H" "Mukamel Z" "Silverman S" "Yaakov G" "Doron S" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "DISARM is a widespread bacterial defence system with broad anti-phage activities.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "90-98", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29085076}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047721", "name" "DISARM protein DrmB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
