{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of cysteine-rich and transmembrane domain-containing proteins, including WIH1 (also known as CYSTEINE-RICH TRANSMEMBRANE MODULE 13), At3g57160 and CYSTEINE-RICH TRANSMEMBRANE MODULE (CYSTM) 1, 3-6 and 8 from Arabidopsis. WIH1 is required for the promotion of megasporogenesis, or promotion of germ cell formation from somatic precursor cells. It functions in a genetic pathway downstream of SPL/NZZ and WUS and together with TORNADO2 (TRN2) in promoting megasporogenesis [[cite:PUB00097336]]. WIH1 is also involved in resistance to abiotic stress [[cite:PUB00100192]]. CYSTMs, are ubiquitous non-secreted cysteine-rich proteins, which play an important role in resistance to abiotic stress [[cite:PUB00100192]]. CYSTM3 negatively regulates salt stress responses and Na+ homeostasis [[cite:PUB00100192], [cite:PUB00100191]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31568" "RCG49325, ISOFORM CRA_A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine-rich and transmembrane domain-containing protein WIH1-like", "short" "WIH1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 219, "taxa" 884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1877, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1877, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1190}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044850", :literature {"PUB00100192" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Xu Y" "Yu Z" "Zhang D" "Huang J" "Wu C" "Yang G" "Yan K" "Zhang S" "Zheng C."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "CYSTM, a Novel Non-Secreted Cysteine-Rich Peptide Family, Involved in Environmental Stresses in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "423-438", "volume" "59", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29272523}, "PUB00100191" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4-5", "authors" ["Xu Y" "Yu Z" "Zhang S" "Wu C" "Yang G" "Yan K" "Zheng C" "Huang J."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "CYSTM3 negatively regulates salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "395-406", "volume" "99", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30701352}, "PUB00097336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Lieber D" "Lora J" "Schrempp S" "Lenhard M" "Laux T."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Biol", "title" "Arabidopsis WIH1 and WIH2 genes act in the transition from somatic to reproductive cell fate.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1009-17", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21658947}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005886", "name" "plasma membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044850", "name" "Cysteine-rich and transmembrane domain-containing protein WIH1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
