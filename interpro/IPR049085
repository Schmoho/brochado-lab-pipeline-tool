{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AcrF3, a protein encoded by gene 35 from phage JBD5, has been reported to specifically inhibit the Cas3 protein of the P. aeruginosa PA14 strain (PaCas3) and to counteract the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system [[cite:PUB00148147]]. AcrF3 eluted as a dimer in gel-filtration chromatography [[cite:PUB00148147]]. In the complex structure, AcrF3 binds to PaCas3 at a ratio of 2:1, suggesting that AcrF3 functions as a homodimer that inhibits PaCas3 [[cite:PUB00148147]]. A single AcrF3 molecule has a two-layer architecture with six Î±-helices [[cite:PUB00148147]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5gnf", "name" "Crystal structure of anti-CRISPR protein AcrF3"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21401" "Cas3 inhibitor AcrF3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cas3 inhibitor AcrF3-like", "short" "AcrF3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 34, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049085", :literature {"PUB00148147" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Wang X" "Yao D" "Xu JG" "Li AR" "Xu J" "Fu P" "Zhou Y" "Zhu Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Struct Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Struct Mol Biol", "title" "Structural basis of Cas3 inhibition by the bacteriophage protein AcrF3.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "868-70", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27455460}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049085", "name" "Cas3 inhibitor AcrF3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 4}}}
