{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subset of the YdjC-like family of uncharacterised proteins. The Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 protein (AFE_0976) is encoded in the same locus as the genes for squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, [interpro:IPR006400]) and other proteins associated with the biosynthesis of hopanoid natural products. Similarly, in Ralstonia eutropha (strain JMP134) (Alcaligenes eutrophus)  this protein (Reut_B4902) is encoded adjacent to the genes for HpnAB, IspH and HpnH ([interpro:IPR017833]), although SHC itself is encoded elsewhere in the genome. Notably, this protein (here named HpnK) and three others form a conserved set (HpnIJKL) which occurs in a subset of all genomes containing the SHC enzyme. This relationship was discerned using the method of partial phylogenetic profiling [[cite:PUB00034422]]. This group includes Zymomonas mobilis, the organism where the initial hopanoid biosynthesis locus was described consisting of the genes for HpnA-E and SHC (HpnF) [[cite:PUB00042985]]. Continuing past SHC are found genes encoding a phosphorylase enzyme (ZMO0873, i.e. HpnG, [interpro:IPR017831]) and a radical SAM enzyme (ZMO0874), HpnH. Although discontinuous in Z. mobilis, we continue the gene symbol sequence with HpnIJKL.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011330", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase/deacetylase, beta/alpha-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03473" "hopanoid biosynthesis-associated protein HpnK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hopanoid biosynthesis associated protein HpnK", "short" "Hopanoid_biosynth-assoc_HpnK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 287, "taxa" 1420, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1241, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1241, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 971}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017836", :literature {"PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
