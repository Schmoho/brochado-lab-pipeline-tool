{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein B2 binds double-strand RNA (dsRNA) with high affinity and suppresses the host RNA silencing-based antiviral response. B2 is expressed by the insect Flock House virus (FHV) as a counter-defense mechanism against antiviral RNA silencing during infection. In vitro, B2 binds to dsRNA as a dimer and inhibits the cleavage of it by Dicer. B2 blocks cleavage of the FHV genome by Dicer and also the incorporation of FHV small interfering RNAs into the RNA-induced silencing complex [[cite:PUB00039458]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037209", "name" "RNA-binding protein B2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11473" "RNA binding protein B2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding protein, B2", "short" "RNA-bd_B2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024377", :literature {"PUB00039458" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Chao JA" "Lee JH" "Chapados BR" "Debler EW" "Schneemann A" "Williamson JR."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
