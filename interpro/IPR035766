{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains SPRY domain-containing protein 7 (also known as SPRY domain-containing protein 7, CLL deletion region gene 6 protein homologue, CLLD6 or chronic lymphocytic leukemia deletion region gene 6 protein homologue). In humans, CLLD6 is highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis as well as cancer cell lines. It also has cross-species conservation, suggesting that it is likely to carry out important cellular processes [[cite:PUB00086145], [cite:PUB00086146]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ccb", "name" "Crystal structure of the SPRY domain-containing protein 7 (SPRY7)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043136", "name" "B30.2/SPRY domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd12880" "SPRY domain-containing protein 7"}, "panther" {"PTHR20951" "C13ORF1 PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPRY domain-containing protein 7", "short" "SPRYD7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 989, "taxa" 4044, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1793, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1772, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1216}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035766", :literature {"PUB00086146" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Mertens D" "Wolf S" "Schroeter P" "Schaffner C" "Dohner H" "Stilgenbauer S" "Lichter P."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V99.11.4116", "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "Down-regulation of candidate tumor suppressor genes within chromosome band 13q14.3 is independent of the DNA methylation pattern in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "4116-21", "volume" "99", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12010815}, "PUB00086145" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Mabuchi H" "Fujii H" "Calin G" "Alder H" "Negrini M" "Rassenti L" "Kipps TJ" "Bullrich F" "Croce CM."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "Cloning and characterization of CLLD6, CLLD7, and CLLD8, novel candidate genes for leukemogenesis at chromosome 13q14, a region commonly deleted in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2870-7", "volume" "61", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11306461}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035766", "name" "SPRY domain-containing protein 7", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
