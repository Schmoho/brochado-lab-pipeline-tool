{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interferon-related developmental regulator (IFRD1) is the human homologue of the Rattus norvegicus early response protein PC4 and its murine homologue TIS7 [[cite:PUB00010173]]. IFRD1 is a transcriptional coactivator/repressor controlling patterns of gene expression by interacting with transcription factors or histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes [[cite:PUB00090213]]. This entry also contains IFRD2 and its murine equivalent SKMc15, which are highly expressed soon after gastrulation and in the hepatic primordium, suggesting an involvement in early hematopoiesis [[cite:PUB00008660]]. Members of this group are generally described as transcriptional regulators implicated in cellular differentiation and various human diseases [[cite:PUB00103871]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12354" "INTERFERON-RELATED DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interferon-related developmental regulator", "short" "IFRD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2204, "taxa" 7557, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3957}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039777", :literature {"PUB00103871" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Brown A" "Baird MR" "Yip MC" "Murray J" "Shao S."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Structures of translationally inactive mammalian ribosomes.
