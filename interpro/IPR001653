{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents diaminopimelate epimerase ([ec:5.1.1.7]), which catalyses the isomerisation of L,L-dimaminopimelate to meso-DAP in the biosynthetic pathway leading from aspartate to lysine. It is a member of the broader family of PLP-independent amino acid racemases.  This enzyme is a monomeric protein of about 30kDa consisting of two domains which are homologus in structure though they share little sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00000449]]. Each domain consists of mixed Î²-sheets which fold into a barrel around the central helix. The active site cleft is formed from both domains and contains two conserved cysteines thought to function as the acid and base in the catalytic reaction [[cite:PUB00025347]]. Other PLP-independent racemases such as glutamate racemase have been shown to share a similar structure and mechanism of catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Bacteria, plants and fungi metabolise aspartic acid to produce four amino acids -lysine, threonine, methionine and isoleucine -in a series of reactions known as the aspartate pathway. Additionally, several important metabolic intermediates are produced by these reactions, such as diaminopimelic acid, an essential component of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, and dipicolinic acid, which is involved in sporulation in Gram-positive bacteria. Members of the animal kingdom do not posses this pathway and must therefore acquire these essential amino acids through their diet. Research into improving the metabolic flux through this pathway has the potential to increase the yield of the essential amino acids in important crops, thus improving their nutritional value. Additionally, since the enzymes are not present in animals, inhibitors of them are promising targets for the development of novel antibiotics and herbicides.

The DAP pathway synthesizes L-lysine from aspartate and pyruvate, and diaminopimelic acid is an intermediate. This pathway is utilised by most bacteria, some archaea, some fungi, some algae, and plants. The AAA pathway synthesizes L-lysine from alpha-ketoglutarate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), and alpha-aminoadipic acid is an intermediate. This pathway is utilised by most fungi, some algae, the bacterium Thermus thermophilus, and probably some archaea, such as Sulfolobus, Thermoproteus, and Pyrococcus.
