{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferases that convert TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose to the 4-amino sugar form, TDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose. In Streptomyces venezuelae, this enzyme is designated DesI, catalyzing the third of six steps in the biosynthesis of TDP-D-desosamine, a component of a number of different macrolide antibiotics made by that organism.
