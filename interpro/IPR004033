{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and ubiqinone. Some members such as the UbiE enzyme from E. coli [[cite:PUB00002307]] are believed to act in both pathways, while others may act in only the menaquinone pathway. These methyltransferases are members of the UbiE/CoQ family of methyltransferases which also contains ubiquinone methyltransferases and other methyltransferases. Members of this clade include a wide distribution of bacteria and eukaryotes, but no archaea. An outgroup for this clade is provided by the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.17]) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides [[cite:PUB00013801]]. Note that a number of non-orthologous genes which are members of [interpro:IPR005493] have been erroneously annotated as MenG methyltransferases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01934" "ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase"}, "profile" {"PS51608" "UbiE family SAM-binding methyltransferase profile"}, "hamap" {"MF_01813" "Ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis C-methyltransferase UbiE [ubiE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UbiE/COQ5 methyltransferase", "short" "UbiE/COQ5_MeTrFase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10387, "taxa" 38156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45604, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35188}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00911", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00911"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1291", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1291"} {"accession" "GenProp0058", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0058"} {"accession" "GenProp1498", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1498"} {"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"} {"accession" "GenProp1744", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1744"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
