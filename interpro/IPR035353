{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of unknown function found in Mycobacterium phages. Family members include the full Gp79 protein found in Mycobacteriophage L5  [swissprot:Q05294]. Mycobacteriophage L5 is a phage isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis. It forms stable lysogens in M. smegmatis and has a broad host range among the pathogenic mycobacteria. L5 encodes gene products (gp) toxic to the host M. smegmatis. Expression of gp79 interferes with the cell membrane or cell-wall synthesis of M. smegmatis, leading to altered cell morphology. It also has a bactericidal effect on E. coli. The N-terminal segment of gp79 (amino acids 1-41) shares sequence similarity with the signal peptide of the D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase of Bacillus licheniformis. This enzyme removes C-terminal D-alanyl residues from sugarpeptide cell-wall precursors and is also a penicillin-binding protein (PBP). The homology of the hydrophobic N-terminal part of gp79 to a PBP (penicillin-binding protein) signal peptide may indicate an interaction of gp79 with proteins or metabolites involved in the peptidoglycan synthesis of M. smegmatis [[cite:PUB00085338]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17463" "Gene product 79"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gene product 79", "short" "Gp79"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 115, "taxa" 491, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 399, "sets" 0, "proteins" 399, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035353", :literature {"PUB00085338" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 8", "authors" ["Rybniker J" "Plum G" "Robinson N" "Small PL" "Hartmann P."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2008/017004-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Identification of three cytotoxic early proteins of mycobacteriophage L5 leading to growth inhibition in Mycobacterium smegmatis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "2304-14", "volume" "154", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18667563}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035353", "name" "Gene product 79", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 152}}}
