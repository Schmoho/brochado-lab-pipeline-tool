{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a diverse family of oxygenases related to the animal heme peroxidases, with members from plants, fungi, and bacteria.

PIOX is expressed during the hypersensitive reaction, which is characterised by rapid and localised cell death induced by infection with pathogens, and the rapidly induced expression of PIOX may be caused by the oxidative burst that occurs in the process of cell death [[cite:PUB00084456]]. PIOX may protect plant tissues from oxidative stress and cell death [[cite:PUB00084454]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4kvl", "name" "Crystal structure of Oryza sativa fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase Y379F with palmitic acid"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010255", "name" "Haem peroxidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037120", "name" "Haem peroxidase domain superfamily, animal type", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09818" "Animal heme oxidases similar to plant pathogen-inducible oxygenases"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-dioxygenase", "short" "A_dioxygenase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 653, "taxa" 2578, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1973, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1965, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1237}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
