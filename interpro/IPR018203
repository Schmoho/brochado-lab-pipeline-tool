{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rab proteins constitute a family of small GTPases that serve a regulatory role in vesicular membrane traffic [[cite:PUB00001266], [cite:PUB00000785]]; C-terminal geranylgeranylation is crucial for their membrane association and function. This post-translational modification is catalysed by Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab-GGTase), a multi-subunit enzyme that contains a catalytic heterodimer and an accessory component, termed Rab escort protein (REP)-1 [[cite:PUB00001266]]. REP-1 presents newly- synthesised Rab proteins to the catalytic component, and forms a stable complex with the prenylated proteins following the transfer reaction. <p>The mechanism of REP-1-mediated membrane association of Rab5 is similar to that mediated by Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). REP-1 and Rab GDI also share other functional properties, including the ability to inhibit the release of GDP and to remove Rab proteins from membranes.</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of the bovine alpha-isoform of Rab GDI has been determined to a resolution of 1.81A [[cite:PUB00004235]]. The protein is composed of two main structural units: a large complex multi-sheet domain I, and a smaller Î±-helical domain II.</p>\n\n<p>The structural organisation of domain I is closely related to FAD-containing monooxygenases and oxidases [[cite:PUB00004235]]. Conserved regions common to GDI and the choroideraemia gene product, which delivers Rab to catalytic subunits of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II, are clustered on one face of the domain [[cite:PUB00000785]]. The two most conserved regions form a compact structure at the apex of the molecule; site-directed mutagenesis has shown these regions to play a critical role in the binding of Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00004235]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1d5t", "name" "GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR, ALPHA-ISOFORM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00996" "GDP dissociation inhibitor"}, "panther" {"PTHR11787" "RAB GDP-DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR"}, "prints" {"PR00891" "RABGDIREP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDP dissociation inhibitor", "short" "GDP_dissociation_inhibitor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 181, "proteomes" 2875, "taxa" 10706, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15960, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8711}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018203", :literature {"PUB00001266" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Alexandrov K" "Horiuchi H" "Steele-Mortimer O" "Seabra MC" "Zerial M."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=7957092", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Rab escort protein-1 is a multifunctional protein that accompanies newly prenylated rab proteins to their target membranes.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "5262-73", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7957092}, "PUB00000785" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Nishimura N" "Goji J" "Nakamura H" "Orita S" "Takai Y" "Sano K."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/55/22/5445", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "Cloning of a brain-type isoform of human Rab GDI and its expression in human neuroblastoma cell lines and tumor specimens.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "5445-50", "volume" "55", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7585614}, "PUB00004235" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6577", "authors" ["Schalk I" "Zeng K" "Wu SK" "Stura EA" "Matteson J" "Huang M" "Tandon A" "Wilson IA" "Balch WE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/381042a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure and mutational analysis of Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "42-8", "volume" "381", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8609986}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005092", "name" "GDP-dissociation inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007264", "name" "small GTPase-mediated signal transduction", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018203", "name" "GDP dissociation inhibitor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000806", "name" "Rab GDI protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR001738", "name" "Rab protein geranylgeranyltransferase component A", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017230", "name" "Rab geranylgeranyltransferase complex component A", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 8433}}}
