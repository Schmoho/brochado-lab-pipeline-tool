It belongs to a family of ribosomal proteins which, on the basis of sequence similarities can be grouped into: bacterial L36; algal and plant chloroplast L36; Cyanelle L36; fungal and animal L36. L36 is a small basic and cysteine-rich protein of around 40 amino-acid residues probably involved in late assembly of the 50S particle, in vitro translation and cell growth. This protein shows a zinc-binding CxxC motif. Its paralogue encoded by ykgO (as named in Escherichia coli), lacks the zinc-binding site and replaces RpmJ when zinc availability is low [[cite:PUB00104109]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035977", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein bL36 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47781" "50S RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L36 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal protein L36, bacteria", "short" "Ribosomal_L36_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3103, "taxa" 11769, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10735, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10735, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8478}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047621", :literature {"PUB00104109" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Ueta M" "Wada C" "Wada A."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "YkgM and YkgO maintain translation by replacing their paralogs, zinc-binding ribosomal proteins L31 and L36, with identical activities.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "562-581", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32559334}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000473", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein bL36", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR047621", "name" "Ribosomal protein L36, bacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
