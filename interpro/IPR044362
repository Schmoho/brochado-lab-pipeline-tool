{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The membrane (M) protein is the most abundant structural protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. It is also regarded as the central organiser of coronavirus assembly, interacting with all other major coronaviral structural proteins. M proteins play a critical role in protein-protein interactions (as well as protein-RNA interactions) since virus-like particle (VLP) formation in many CoVs requires only the M and envelope (E) proteins for efficient virion assembly [[cite:PUB00094066]]. Interaction of spike (S) with M is necessary for retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi complex and its incorporation into new virions, but dispensable for the assembly process. Binding of M to nucleocapsid (N) proteins stabilises the nucleocapsid (N protein-RNA complex), as well as the internal core of virions, and, ultimately, promotes completion of viral assembly. Together, M and E protein make up the viral envelope and their interaction is sufficient for the production and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) [[cite:PUB00094065], [cite:PUB00099876], [cite:PUB00100403]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry contains the Membrane (M) protein of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, and similar proteins from betacoronaviruses in the embecovirus subgenera (A lineage).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21568" "Membrane (or Matrix) protein from human coronavirus and related betacoronaviruses in the A lineage"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "M matrix/glycoprotein, HCoV-like", "short" "M_HCoV-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 112, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 201, "sets" 0, "proteins" 201, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044362", :literature {"PUB00100403" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Boson B" "Legros V" "Zhou B" "Siret E" "Mathieu C" "Cosset FL" "Lavillette D" "Denolly S."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The SARS-CoV-2 envelope and membrane proteins modulate maturation and retention of the spike protein, allowing assembly of virus-like particles.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "100111", "volume" "296", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33229438}, "PUB00099876" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lubin JH" "Zardecki C" "Dolan EM" "Lu C" "Shen Z" "Dutta S" "Westbrook JD" "Hudson BP" "Goodsell DS" "Williams JK" "Voigt M" "Sarma V" "Xie L" "Venkatachalam T" "Arnold S" "Alfaro Alvarado LH" "Catalfano K" "Khan A" "McCarthy E" "Staggers S" "Tinsley B" "Trudeau A" "Singh J" "Whitmore L" "Zheng H" "Benedek M" "Currier J" "Dresel M" "Duvvuru A" "Dyszel B" "Fingar E" "Hennen EM" "Kirsch M" "Khan AA" "Labrie-Cleary C" "Laporte S" "Lenkeit E" "Martin K" "Orellana M" "Ortiz-Alvarez de la Campa M" "Paredes I" "Wheeler B" "Rupert A" "Sam A" "See K" "Soto Zapata S" "Craig PA" "Hall BL" "Jiang J" "Koeppe JR" "Mills SA" "Pikaart MJ" "Roberts R" "Bromberg Y" "Hoyer JS" "Duffy S" "Tischfield J" "Ruiz FX" "Arnold E" "Baum J" "Sandberg J" "Brannigan G" "Khare SD" "Burley SK."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome in three dimensions (3D) during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34580920}, "PUB00094066" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ujike M" "Taguchi F."], "ISO_journal" "Viruses", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Viruses", "title" "Incorporation of spike and membrane glycoproteins into coronavirus virions.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1700-25", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25855243}, "PUB00094065" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Schoeman D" "Fielding BC."], "ISO_journal" "Virol.
