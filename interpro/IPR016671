{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LuxE is an acyl-protein synthetase found in bioluminescent bacteria. LuxE catalyses the formation of an acyl-protein thiolester from a fatty acid and a protein. This is the second step in the bioluminescent fatty acid reduction system, which converts tetradecanoic acid to the aldehyde substrate of the luciferase-catalysed bioluminescence reaction [[cite:PUB00010004]]. A conserved cysteine found at position 364 in Photobacterium phosphoreum LuxE ([swissprot:Q52100]) is thought to be acylated during the transfer of the acyl group from the synthetase subunit to the reductase. The C-terminal of the synthetase is though to act as a flexible arm to transfer acyl groups between the sites of activation and reduction [[cite:PUB00010003]]. A LuxE domain is also found in the Vibrio cholerae RBFN protein ([swissprot:Q06961]), which is involved in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen component 3-deoxy-L-glycero-tetronic acid.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents an acyl-protein synthetase, LuxE type found in bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016580" "Acyl-protein synthetase, LuxE type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl-protein synthetase, LuxE, bacterial", "short" "LuxE_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 378, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 423, "sets" 0, "proteins" 423, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 366}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
