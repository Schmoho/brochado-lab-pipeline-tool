{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents phosphonopyruvate, a decarboxylase enzyme that produces phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald), which is the second step in the biosynthesis phosphonate-containing compounds. Since the preceding enzymatic step, PEP phosphomutase (AepX, [interpro:IPR012698]) favours the substrate PEP energetically, the decarboxylase is required to drive the reaction in the direction of phosphonate production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pald is a precursor of natural products including antibiotics like bialaphos [[cite:PUB00042846]] and phosphonothricin [[cite:PUB00042847]] in Streptomyces species, phosphonate-modified molecules such as the polysaccharide B of Bacteroides fragilis [[cite:PUB00042848]], the phosphonolipids of Tetrahymena pyriformis [[cite:PUB00042849]], the glycosylinositolphospholipids of Trypanosoma cruzi [[cite:PUB00042850]]. This gene generally occurs in prokaryotic organisms adjacent to the gene for AepX. Most often an aminotransferase (aepZ) is also present which leads to the production of the most common phosphonate compound, 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03297" "phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase", "short" "Phosphono-pyrv_decarboxylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 520, "taxa" 3007, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2190, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2190, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1660}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0724", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0724"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
