{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the following members of peptidase subfamily M3A: peptidyl dipeptidase DCP (EC 3.4.15.5; MEROPS identifier M03.005; also known as dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase) and oligopeptidase A (OpdA; EC 3.4.24.70; MEROPS identifier M03.004). DCP releases dipeptides from the C-termini of various peptides and proteins, the smallest substrate being N-blocked tripeptides and unblocked tetrapeptides. DCP from E. coli is inhibited by the anti-hypertensive drug captopril, an inhibitor of the mammalian angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, also called peptidyl dipeptidase A) [[cite:PUB00082131], [cite:PUB00038441]]. Oligopeptidase A (OpdA) may play a specific role in the degradation of signal peptides after they are released from precursor forms of secreted proteins. It can also cleave N-acetyl-L-Ala [[cite:PUB00082132]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1y79", "name" "Crystal Structure of the E.coli Dipeptidyl Carboxypeptidase Dcp in Complex with a Peptidic Inhibitor"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024077", "name" "Neurolysin/Thimet oligopeptidase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06456" "Peptidase family M3, dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (DCP)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidyl-dipeptidase DCP", "short" "M3A_DCP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5361, "taxa" 21206, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27597, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27594, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21070}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
