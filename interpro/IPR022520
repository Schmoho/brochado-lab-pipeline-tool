{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family (GadC) are antiporters thought to import glutamine and export gamma-aminobutyrate as part of an acid resistance system, although glutamate might also be transported. Some members are found adjacent to a glutamate decarboxylase (GadB), which converts glutamate (Glu) to gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA). However, the majority belong to genome contexts with a glutaminase (converts Gln to Glu) as well as the decarboxylase that converts Glu to GABA. The exact specificity of the transporter remains uncertain. Note that the gene symbol gadC is used both for this antiporter and for known glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporters such as in Escherichia coli.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03813" "putative glutamine/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter GadC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter", "short" "Glu/GABA_antiporter_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 95, "taxa" 666, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 588, "sets" 0, "proteins" 588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 469}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022520", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002293", "name" "Amino acid/polyamine transporter I", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004754", "name" "Amino acid antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR022461", "name" "Arginine/ornithine antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR004755", "name" "Cationic amino acid transport permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004756", "name" "Amino acid permease subfamily", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004757", "name" "Ethanolamine permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004758", "name" "Amino acid transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004759", "name" "Glutamate:g-aminobutyrate antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004760", "name" "L-type amino acid transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017794", "name" "Urea carboxylase-associated, permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022520", "name" "Putative glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027562", "name" "Histidine-histamine antiporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027566", "name" "Putrescine transporter PotE", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044566", "name" "Polyamine transporter RMV1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
