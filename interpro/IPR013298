{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two closely related neuropeptide precursors, which share no significant sequence similarity with other known neuropeptides, have recently been identified and named preproneuropeptide B and preproneuropeptide W [[cite:PUB00013914], [cite:PUB00013915], [cite:PUB00013916]]. In humans, each precursor contains a signal sequence and two dibasic cleavage sites. Alternative cleavage of these sites results in long (29 or 30 amino acid) and short (23 amino acid) forms of the resultant neuropeptides [[cite:PUB00013914], [cite:PUB00013915]]. Murine, rat and bovine versions of preproneuropeptide B, however, contain only the second cleavage site, resulting in only the long form of neuropeptide B [[cite:PUB00013915], [cite:PUB00013916]].  Neuropeptide B is expressed in both the central nervous system (CNS) and in the periphery. In the CNS, highest levels of the peptide are found in the substantia nigra and hypothalamus, suggesting a possible role in locomotor control and the release of pituitary hormones [[cite:PUB00013915]]. In the periphery, the peptide is most abundant in testis, ovary, uterus, placenta, spleen, lymph nodes and peripheral blood leukocytes, indicating potential roles in the reproductive and immune systems [[cite:PUB00013915]]. Unusually, neuropeptide B purified from bovine hypothalamus was found to be brominated at its N terminus [[cite:PUB00013916]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the neuropeptide B precursor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01889" "Neuropeptide B precursor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuropeptide B precursor", "short" "Neuropept_B_pre"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 257, "taxa" 1110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1544, "sets" 0, "proteins" 454, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 293}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013298", :literature {"PUB00013914" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Shimomura Y" "Harada M" "Goto M" "Sugo T" "Matsumoto Y" "Abe M" "Watanabe T" "Asami T" "Kitada C" "Mori M" "Onda H" "Fujino M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
