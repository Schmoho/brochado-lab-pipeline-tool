{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) comprise 12.5% of the mass, and 82-90% of the protein content [[cite:PUB00006672]], of honeybee (Apis mellifera) royal jelly. Royal jelly is a substance secreted by the cephalic glands of nurse bees [[cite:PUB00006681]] and it is used to trigger development of a queen bee from a bee larva. The biological function of the MRJPs is unknown, but they are believed to play a major role in nutrition due to their high essential amino acid content [[cite:PUB00006678]]. Two royal jelly proteins, MRJP3 and MRJP5, contain a tandem repeat that results from a high genetic variability. This polymorphism may be useful for genotyping individual bees [[cite:PUB00006678]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes related proteins such as protein yellow-f and yellow-f2 from Drosophila, which are dopachrome-conversion enzymes responsible for catalysing the conversion of dopachrome into 5,6-dihydroxyindole in the melanization pathway [[cite:PUB00079186], [[cite:PUB00101888]]. This family of yellow-like proteins has only been identified within insects and a number of bacterial species [[cite:PUB00071140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qe8", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative hydrolase (ava_4197) from anabaena variabilis atcc 29413 at 1.35 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011042", "name" "Six-bladed beta-propeller, TolB-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03022" "Major royal jelly protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR10009" "PROTEIN YELLOW-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR01366" "ROYALJELLY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major royal jelly protein/protein yellow", "short" "Royal_jelly/protein_yellow"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 113, "proteomes" 1402, "taxa" 6338, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9906, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9506, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6706}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
