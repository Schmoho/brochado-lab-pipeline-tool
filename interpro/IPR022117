{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains the SARS coronavirus 3b protein which is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, and induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in transfected cells [[cite:PUB00094539], [cite:PUB00094538]]. SARS-CoV mRNA 3 encodes the distinct proteins ORF3a and ORF3b proteins, which are translated in different reading frames. SARS-CoV accessory protein ORF3b antagonizes interferon (IFN) function by modulating the activity of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The IFN system functions as the first line of defense against viral infection in mammalian cells. Viral infection triggers a series of cellular events that lead to the production of IFN and several downstream antiviral genes, helping to establish an antiviral state. Viruses encode IFN antagonists to counteract the antiviral effects of IFN. SARS-CoV ORF3b, ORF6, and N proteins function as IFN antagonists. ORF3b inhibits both IFN synthesis and signaling [[cite:PUB00095866], [cite:PUB00095865]]. It localizes to the nucleus in transfected cells [[cite:PUB00095864]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21649" "accessory protein ORF3b of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus"}, "pfam" {"PF12383" "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3b protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3b protein", "short" "SARS_3b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 95, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 91, "sets" 0, "proteins" 91, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022117", :literature {"PUB00094538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yuan X" "Shan Y" "Yao Z" "Li J" "Zhao Z" "Chen J" "Cong Y."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
