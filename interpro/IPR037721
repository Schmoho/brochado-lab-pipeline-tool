{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ferlins are involved in vesicle fusion events [[cite:PUB00071419]].  Ferlins and other proteins, such as synaptotagmins, are implicated in facilitating the fusion process when cell membranes fuse together.  There are six known human Ferlins: Dysferlin (Fer1L1), Otoferlin (Fer1L2), Myoferlin (Fer1L3), Fer1L4, Fer1L5, and Fer1L6.  Defects in these genes can lead to a wide range of diseases including muscular dystrophy (dysferlin), deafness (otoferlin), and infertility (fer-1, fertilization factor-1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Structurally they have 6 tandem C2 domains, designated as (C2A-C2F) and a single C-terminal transmembrane domain, though there is a new study that disputes this and claims that there are actually 7 tandem C2 domains with another C2 domain inserted between C2D and C2E.  In a subset of them (Dysferlin, Myoferlin, and Fer1) there is an additional conserved domain called DysF [[cite:PUB00054013]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12546" "FER-1-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferlin family", "short" "Ferlin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1134, "taxa" 4511, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16039, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16039, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6103}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037721", :literature {"PUB00071419" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lek A" "Evesson FJ" "Sutton RB" "North KN" "Cooper ST."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01267.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Ferlins: regulators of vesicle fusion for auditory neurotransmission, receptor trafficking and membrane repair.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "185-94", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21838746}, "PUB00054013" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lek A" "Lek M" "North KN" "Cooper ST."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Evol.
