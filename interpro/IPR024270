{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents urocortin II and III, which are members of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of neuropeptides. Urocortin II and III are secreted peptides and bind with high affinity to  CRF receptors 2-alpha and 2-beta. They are involved in the suppression of food intake, the delay of gastric emptying, and may represent endogenous ligands for maintaining homeostasis after stress. Their backbone is mainly Î±-helical, but contains a helix-loop-helix motif [[cite:PUB00049427]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17575" "UROCORTIN-2 AND 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urocortin II/III", "short" "Urocortin_II/III"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 414, "taxa" 1588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 795, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 506}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024270", :literature {"PUB00049427" {"URL" nil, "issue" "51", "authors" ["Grace CR" "Perrin MH" "Cantle JP" "Vale WW" "Rivier JE" "Riek R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
