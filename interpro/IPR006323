{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase or phosphonatase catalyses the cleavage of the carbon-phosphorous bond of a phosphonate.</p>\r\n<p>This enzyme is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases, and contains a modified version of the conserved catalytic motifs of that superfamily [[cite:PUB00003337]]. The first motif is usually DxDx(T/V); here it is DxAxT. In the third motif the normally conserved lysine is instead an arginine. Additionally, the enzyme from Bacillus cereus contains a unique conserved catalytic lysine which is involved in the binding and activation of the substrate through the formation of a Schiff base [[cite:PUB00009540]].</p>\r\n<p>The substrate of this enzyme is the product of 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) transaminase, phosphonoacetaldehyde. This degradation pathway for AEP may be related to its toxic properties which are utilised by microorganisms as a chemical warfare agent.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02586" "Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase); similar to Bacillus cereus phosphonatase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01375" "Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase [phnX]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01422" "phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase", "short" "Phosphonoacetald_hydro"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 801, "taxa" 4877, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4855, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4855, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3693}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0238", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0238"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
