{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GATA transcription factors mediate processes of development, differentiation, and gene expression in multiple tissues and cell types. Vertebrate GATA factors have two highly conserved zinc finger motifs and recognise a six-nucleotide motif T/AGATAG/A in target genes. They are separated into two subfamilies: 1) GATA1, GATA2, and GATA3 and 2) GATA4, GATA5, and GATA6. Members of the GATA1/2/3 subfamily are expressed in developing blood cells, where they regulate differentiation-specific gene expression in hematopoiesis [[cite:PUB00070368]]. This entry represents the GATA2 and GATA3.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003027" "Transcription factor, GATA-1/2/3 types"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor, GATA-2/3", "short" "TF_GATA-2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 681, "taxa" 2610, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2608, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2295, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1560}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016374", :literature {"PUB00070368" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Orkin SH."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "GATA-binding transcription factors in hematopoietic cells.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "575-81", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1638017}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000981", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039355", "name" "Transcription factor GATA", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016374", "name" "Transcription factor, GATA-2/3", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016375", "name" "Transcription factor GATA-4/5/6", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
