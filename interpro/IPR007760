{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Catalases ([ec:1.11.1.6]) are antioxidant enzymes that catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a consequence of oxidative cellular metabolism and can be converted to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical via transition metals, this radical being able to damage a wide variety of molecules within a cell, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Catalases act to neutralise hydrogen peroxide toxicity, and are produced by all aerobic organisms ranging from bacteria to man.  There are three structurally independent classes of catalases: ubiquitous mono-functional haem-containing catalases ([interpro:IPR002226]), bifunctional haem-containing catalase-peroxidases that are closely related to plant peroxidases ([interpro:IPR000763]), and non-haem manganese-containing catalases  [[cite:PUB00015054]].</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents the non-haem Mn-catalases, which are found in several bacterial species [[cite:PUB00015059]]. The structure of the Mn catalase from Lactobacillus plantarum reveals a homo-hexamer, where each subunit contains a dimanganese active site that is accessed by a single substrate channel [[cite:PUB00010186]]. The dimanganese active site performs a two-electron catalytic cycle that alternately oxidises and reduces the dimanganese atoms in a manner that is similar to its haem-counterpart found in other catalases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2v8t", "name" "Crystal structure of Mn catalase from Thermus Thermophilus complexed with chloride"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027407", "name" "Manganese catalase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05067" "Manganese containing catalase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Manganese catalase", "short" "Mn_catalase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 2321, "taxa" 9273, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11332, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8710}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0213", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0213"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
