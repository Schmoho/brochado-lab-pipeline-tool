{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GatD (Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D) is found only in the Archaea. It is part of a heterodimer, with GatE ([interpro:IPR004414]), that acts as an amidotransferase on misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln) to produce Gln-tRNA(Gln). This function is carried out in bacteria by the GatABC system, which acts both on Asp-tRNA(Asn) and Glu-tRNA(Gln). GatABC orthologues also exist in some archaea, where it coexist with GatDE; while other archaea only posses GatED and use an asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase to produce Asn-tRNA by direct acylation of the tRNA [[cite:PUB00015320]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036152", "name" "Asparaginase/glutaminase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037152", "name" "L-asparaginase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037222", "name" "GatD, N-terminal superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08962" "GatD subunit of archaeal Glu-tRNA amidotransferase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF500175" "Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase, subunit D"}, "hamap" {"MF_00586" "Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D [gatD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02153" "Glu-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit GatD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D", "short" "GatD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 319, "taxa" 2602, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3378, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2727}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0258", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0258"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
