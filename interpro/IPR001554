A classification system for glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition of 85 different families [[cite:PUB00004870], [cite:PUB00005266]].

A Glu residue has been proposed as a catalytic residue, but it is not known if it is the nucleophile or the proton donor.</p>\n\n<p>Beta-amylase [[cite:PUB00005234], [cite:PUB00005062]] is an enzyme that hydrolyses 1,4-alpha-glucosidic linkages in starch-type polysaccharide substrates so as to remove successive maltose units from the non-reducing ends of the chains. Beta-amylase is present in certain bacteria as well as in plants.</p>\n\n<p>Three highly conserved sequence regions are found in all known beta-amylases. The first of these regions is located in the N-terminal section of the enzymes and contains an aspartate which is known to be involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00002337]]. The second, located in a more central location, is centred around a glutamate which is also involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00001450]].</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structure of a complex of soybean beta-amylase with an inhibitor (alpha-cyclodextrin) has been determined to 3.0A resolution by X-ray diffraction [[cite:PUB00002354]]. The enzyme folds into large and small domains: the large domain has a (β/α)8 super-secondary structural core, while the smaller is formed from two long loops extending from the β3 and β4 strands of the (β/α)8 fold. The interface of the two domains, together with shorter loops from the (β α)8 core, form a deep cleft, in which the inhibitor binds. Two maltose molecules also bind in the cleft, one sharing a binding site with alpha-cyclodextrin, and the other sitting more deeply in the cleft [[cite:PUB00002354]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7upv", "name" "Structure of maize BZR1-type beta-amylase provides new insights into its noncatalytic adaptation"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31352" "BETA-AMYLASE 1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}, "pfam" {"PF01373" "Glycosyl hydrolase family 14"}, "prints" {"PR00750" "BETAAMYLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 14", "short" "Glyco_hydro_14"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 52, "domain_architectures" 116, "proteomes" 406, "taxa" 2148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6601, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4153}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GH14", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GH14.html"}]}, "prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00414", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00414"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1726", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1726"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
