{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA polymerase I-specific transcription-initiation factor Rrn6 is a component of a multisubunit core transcription factor, essential for the initiation of rDNA transcription by Pol I [[cite:PUB00044475], [cite:PUB00099775]]. The DNA-bound core factor (CF) resembles a right hand holding the DNA molecule between the fingers and the palm, with the thumb pointing toward Pol I. The palm is composed of the N-terminal regions of Rrn11 and Rrn6, the thumb is composed of the C-terminal of Rrn11 while the fingers and knuckles are composed of Rrn7 and the C-terminal half of Rrn6, respectively [[cite:PUB00099775], [cite:PUB00100002]]. This entry represents the beta-propeller domain of Rrn6 which is part of the palm (or module I in [[cite:PUB00044475]]) of the CF which interacts with Rrn11 [[cite:PUB00099775], [cite:PUB00100002]]. These proteins are found in fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28221" "RNA POLYMERASE I-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION FACTOR RRN6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN6-like", "short" "RNA_pol_I-sp_TIF_RRN6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 924, "taxa" 2545, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1380, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1380, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 870}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019350", :literature {"PUB00044475" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Keys DA" "Vu L" "Steffan JS" "Dodd JA" "Yamamoto RT" "Nogi Y" "Nomura M."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/19/2349", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "RRN6 and RRN7 encode subunits of a multiprotein complex essential for the initiation of rDNA transcription by RNA polymerase I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "2349-62", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7958901}, "PUB00100002" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Han Y" "Yan C" "Nguyen THD" "Jackobel AJ" "Ivanov I" "Knutson BA" "He Y."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Structural mechanism of ATP-independent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase I.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28623663}, "PUB00099775" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Engel C" "Gubbey T" "Neyer S" "Sainsbury S" "Oberthuer C" "Baejen C" "Bernecky C" "Cramer P."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural Basis of RNA Polymerase I Transcription Initiation.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "120-131.e22", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28340337}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019350", "name" "RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN6-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016531", "name" "RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor Rrn6", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
