{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Following the action of a flavin-dependent L-amino acid oxidase that converts L-tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvate imine, the enzymes VioB (this family; also known as 2-imino-3-(indol-3-yl)propanoate dimerase, [ec:1.11.1.6]), RebD, and StaD can ligate two molecules, forming a coupled iminophenyl-pyruvate dimer. In the violacein biosynthesis pathway, this compound is acted on by VioE before it cyclizes spontaneously to chromopyrrolic acid. In the pathways of homologue StaD (staurosporine), chromopyrrolate is formed, and the enzyme is referred to as chromopyrrolate synthase. RebD is very similar to StaD, but acts on chlorinated Trp-derived molecules [[cite:PUB00074342]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04492" "iminophenyl-pyruvate dimer synthase VioB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Violacein biosynthesis protein VioB", "short" "VioB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 114, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 76, "sets" 0, "proteins" 76, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
