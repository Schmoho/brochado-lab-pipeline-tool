{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tsx gene of Escherichia coli encodes an outer membrane protein, Tsx, which constitutes the receptor for colicin K and Bacteriophage T6, and functions as a substrate-specific channel for nucleosides and deoxy-nucleosides [[cite:PUB00006257]]. The protein contains 294 amino acids, the first 22 of which are characteristic of a bacterial signal sequence peptide. The putative mature form of Tsx contains 272 residues with a calculated Mr of 31418. The Tsx sequence shows an even distribution of charged residues and lacks extensive hydrophobic stretches [[cite:PUB00006257]]. Tsx shows no significant similarities to the channel-forming proteins OmpC, OmpF, PhoE and LamB from the E. coli outer membrane.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also contains related proteins of unknown function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036777", "name" "Nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein, Tsx-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03502" "Nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein, Tsx"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein, Tsx-like", "short" "Channel_Tsx-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 438, "taxa" 3522, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4784}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018013", :literature {"PUB00006257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bremer E" "Middendorf A" "Martinussen J" "Valentin-Hansen P."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(90)90341-N", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Analysis of the tsx gene, which encodes a nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein (Tsx) in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "59-65", "volume" "96", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2265760}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009279", "name" "cell outer membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018013", "name" "Nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein, Tsx-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003055", "name" "Nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein Tsx", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 15, "alignment:full" 540}}}
