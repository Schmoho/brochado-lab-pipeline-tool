{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CheD deamidates glutamine residues to glutamate on methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors (MCPs). CheD-mediated MCP deamidation is required for productive communication of the conformational signals of the chemoreceptors to the cheA kinase [[cite:PUB00043343]]. CheC is a CheY-P phosphatase (CheY controls flagellar rotation and is activated by phosphorylation). The activity of CheC is enhanced by its interaction with CheD, forming a CheC-CheD heterodimer. It is suggested that CheC exerts its effect on MCP methylation in Bacillus subtilis by controlling the binding of CheD to the MCPs [[cite:PUB00019299]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011324", "name" "Cytotoxic necrotizing factor-like, catalytic", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038592", "name" "CheD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16352" "chemotaxis protein CheD stimulates methylation of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins"}, "panther" {"PTHR35147" "CHEMORECEPTOR GLUTAMINE DEAMIDASE CHED-RELATED"}, "hamap" {"MF_01440" "Chemoreceptor glutamine deamidase CheD [cheD]"}, "pfam" {"PF03975" "CheD chemotactic sensory transduction"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chemoreceptor glutamine deamidase CheD", "short" "Chemorcpt_Glu_NH3ase_CheD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 2916, "taxa" 11654, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13055, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13054, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10324}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
