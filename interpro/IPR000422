{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase ([ec:4.1.99.12]) (DHBP synthase) (RibB) catalyses the conversion of D-ribulose 5-phosphate to formate and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate, the latter serving as the biosynthetic precursor for the xylene ring of riboflavin [[cite:PUB00003582]]. In Photobacterium leiognathi, the riboflavin synthesis genes ribB (DHBP synthase), ribE (riboflavin synthase), ribH (lumazone synthase) and ribA (GTP cyclohydrolase II) all reside in the lux operon [[cite:PUB00043824]]. RibB is sometimes found as a bifunctional enzyme with GTP cyclohydrolase II that catalyses the first committed step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin ([interpro:IPR000926]).
