{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of short proteins includes DNA-damage-inducible protein I (DinI) and related proteins. The SOS response, a set of cellular phenomena exhibited by eubacteria, is initiated by various causes that include DNA damage-induced replication arrest, and is positively regulated by the co- protease activity of RecA. Escherichia coli DinI, a LexA-regulated SOS gene product, shuts off the initiation of the SOS response when overexpressed<i>in vivo</i>. Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that DinI physically interacts with RecA to inhibit its co-protease activity [[cite:PUB00012280]]. The structure of DinI is known [[cite:PUB00012281]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036687", "name" "DinI-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36572" "DNA DAMAGE-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN I-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF06183" "DinI-like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA damage-inducible protein DinI-like", "short" "DNA_damage-inducible_DinI-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 198, "taxa" 1574, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5202, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5202, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4020}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010391", :literature {"PUB00012280" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Yoshimasu M" "Aihara H" "Ito Y" "Rajesh S" "Ishibe S" "Mikawa T" "Yokoyama S" "Shibata T."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkg256", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "An NMR study on the interaction of Escherichia coli DinI with RecA-ssDNA complexes.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1735-43", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12626715}, "PUB00012281" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ramirez BE" "Voloshin ON" "Camerini-Otero RD" "Bax A."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.proteinscience.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/11/2161", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Solution structure of DinI provides insight into its mode of RecA inactivation.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2161-9", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11152126}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010391", "name" "DNA damage-inducible protein DinI-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 17, "alignment:full" 321}}}
