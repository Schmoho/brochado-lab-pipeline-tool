{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of sulfurtransferases, including thiosulfate sulfurtransferases and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases.</p>\n\n<p>Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (also known as rhodanese, [ec:2.8.1.1]) is an enzyme which catalyses the transfer of the sulphane atom of thiosulphate to cyanide, to form sulphite and thiocyanate. In vertebrates, rhodanese is a mitochondrial enzyme that is involved in forming iron-sulphur complexes and cyanide detoxification. A cysteine residue takes part in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00003557], [cite:PUB00000494]]. Some bacterial proteins may also express sulfotransferase activity. These include, SseA from Mycobacterium leprae and Escherichia coli, Azotobacter vinelandii rhdA, Saccharopolyspora erythraea cysA [[cite:PUB00002108]] and Synechococcus sp. (strain PCC 7942) rhdA [[cite:PUB00002137]].</p>\n\n<p>3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST, [ec:2.8.1.2] catalyses the desulfuration of 3-mercaptopyruvate to generate an enzyme-bound hydropersulfide [[cite:PUB00097993]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5wqk", "name" "Crystal structure of 3-Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase(3MST) in complex with compound1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036873", "name" "Rhodanese-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11364" "THIOSULFATE SULFERTANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfurtransferase TST/MPST-like", "short" "TST/MPST-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7911, "taxa" 27461, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29822, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29822, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21982}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
