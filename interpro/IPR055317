{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE)-related protein 14 from Arabidopsis thaliana (CLE14) and similar proteins predominantly found in plants. CLE14 is an extracellular signal peptide that regulates cell fate. It represses root apical meristem maintenance and functions as an elicitor of the root meristem differentiation through the CLV2/CRN complex signalling pathway. This protein inhibits irreversibly root growth by reducing cell division rates in the root apical meristem [[cite:PUB00155350], [cite:PUB00155351]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35472" "PTHR35472"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE)-related protein 14-like", "short" "CLE14-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 100, "taxa" 403, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 350, "sets" 0, "proteins" 350, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 226}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055317", :literature {"PUB00155350" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Meng L" "Feldman LJ."], "ISO_journal" "Planta", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-010-1236-4", "medline_journal" "Planta", "title" "CLE14/CLE20 peptides may interact with CLAVATA2/CORYNE receptor-like kinases to irreversibly inhibit cell division in the root meristem of Arabidopsis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1061-74", "volume" "232", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20697738}, "PUB00155351" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Gutierrez-Alanis D" "Yong-Villalobos L" "Jimenez-Sandoval P" "Alatorre-Cobos F" "Oropeza-Aburto A" "Mora-Macias J" "Sanchez-Rodriguez F" "Cruz-Ramirez A" "Herrera-Estrella L."], "ISO_journal" "Dev Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2017.05.009", "medline_journal" "Dev Cell", "title" "Phosphate Starvation-Dependent Iron Mobilization Induces CLE14 Expression to Trigger Root Meristem Differentiation through CLV2/PEPR2 Signaling.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "555-570.e3", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28586647}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055317", "name" "CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE)-related protein 14-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
