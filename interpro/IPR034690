{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes endolysin, a lysozyme from bacteriophage T4 and its relatives.  Endolysin is required for host cell lysis, and degrades the cross-links in the bacterial cell wall following on from pore formation in the cell membrane by holin and spanin [[cite:PUB00084188]].  Endolysin specifically hydrolyses the (1->4)-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan and between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in chitodextrins [[cite:PUB00084189]].  Host cell lysis is required for released of virus particles from the cell.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes SAR-endolysins. Canonical phage lysozymes accumulate fully folded and enzymatically active in the cytoplasm. In contrast, SAR-endolysins are first secreted as enzymatically inactive enzymes anchored to the membrane by the N-terminal SAR domain 2 [[cite:PUB00094465], [cite:PUB00094466]]. This functional regulation is essential to avoid premature lysis of the infected host [[cite:PUB00094465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1g0p", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF T4 LYSOZYME MUTANT V149G"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023346", "name" "Lysozyme-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023347", "name" "Lysozyme domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04110" "Endolysin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endolysin T4 type", "short" "Endolysin_T4_type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 849, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1881, "taxa" 9642, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12460, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12458, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7725}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
