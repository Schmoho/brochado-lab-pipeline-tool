{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Axonemal dynein light chain proteins play a dynamic role in flagellar and cilial motility. Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are complex organelles consisting of a core structure, the axoneme, which is composed of nine microtubule doublets forming a cylinder that surrounds a pair of central singlet microtubules. This ultra-structural arrangement seems to be one of the most stable micro-tubular assemblies known and is responsible for the flagellar and ciliary movement of a large number of organisms ranging from protozoan to mammals. This light chain interacts directly with the N-terminal half of the heavy chains [[cite:PUB00044164]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10211" "Axonemal dynein light chain"}, "panther" {"PTHR13183" "AXONEMAL INNER ARM DYNEIN LIGHT CHAIN 28"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Axonemal dynein light chain", "short" "Axonemal_dynein_light_chain"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 55, "proteomes" 1090, "taxa" 4459, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3737, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3699, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2439}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019347", :literature {"PUB00044164" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yanagisawa HA" "Kamiya R."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
