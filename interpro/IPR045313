{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of NADPH-dependent short chain dehydrogenase/reductases, including human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and CBR3. CBR1 is an NADPH-dependent SDR with broad substrate specificity and may be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds [[cite:PUB00050636]]. This entry also includes poppy NADPH-dependent salutaridine reductase which catalyses the stereospecific reduction of salutaridine to 7(S)-salutaridinol in the biosynthesis of morphine [[cite:PUB00098527]], and Arabidopsis SDR1, a menthone reductase, which catalyses the reduction of menthone to neomenthol, a compound with antimicrobial activity; SDR1 can also carry out neomenthol oxidation [[cite:PUB00096559]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hrb", "name" "Crystal Structure of human Carbonyl Reductase 3, complexed with NADP+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05324" "Porcine testicular carbonyl reductase (PTCR)-like, classical (c) SDRs"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1-like", "short" "CBR1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2352, "taxa" 9453, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9468, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9397, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6377}, "pathways" 157}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
