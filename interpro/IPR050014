{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase activase PflE (also known as trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase activating enzyme or glycyl-radical enzyme activating enzyme PflE) found in some gram-positive species. This enzyme catalyses the activation of the trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase under anaerobic conditions by generation of an organic free radical on a glycine residue, via a homolytic cleavage of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM).  PflE is involved in the anaerobic degradation of 4-hydroxyproline [[cite:PUB00090957]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF043069" "trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase activase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase activase", "short" "T4HPD_activ_SAM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 82, "taxa" 360, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 245, "sets" 0, "proteins" 245, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 196}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
