{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Orthomyxoviridae RNA polymerase with the subunit composition of PB1-PB2-PA is a unique multifunctional enzyme with the activities of both synthesis and cleavage of RNA, and is involved in both transcription and replication of the RNA genome. Transcription is initiated by using capped RNA fragments, which are generated after cleavage of host cell mRNA by the RNA polymerase-associated capped RNA endonuclease [[cite:PUB00005639]]. The PB2 subunit has cap-binding and cap-dependent endonuclease activities [[cite:PUB00087126]]. It appears that two separate sequences, one N-(242-282) and the other C-terminal (538-577) proximal segments of PB2 subunit, constitute the RNA cap-binding site of the Influenza virus RNA polymerase [[cite:PUB00006567]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037258", "name" "PB2, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04062" "Polymerase basic protein 2 [PB2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit PB2", "short" "INV_PB2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 92, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 51959, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 61845, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61845, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1012", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1012"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001591", :literature {"PUB00006567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Honda A" "Mizumoto K" "Ishihama A."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Cells", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.1999.00275.x", "medline_journal" "Genes Cells", "title" "Two separate sequences of PB2 subunit constitute the RNA cap-binding site of influenza virus RNA polymerase.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "475-85", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10526235}, "PUB00005639" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Shi L" "Galarza JM" "Summers DF."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-1702(96)01289-0", "medline_journal" "Virus Res", "title" "Recombinant-baculovirus-expressed PB2 subunit of the influenza A virus RNA polymerase binds cap groups as an isolated subunit.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "1-9", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8806170}, "PUB00087126" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Gonzalez S" "Ortin J."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/emboj/18.13.3767", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Distinct regions of influenza virus PB1 polymerase subunit recognize vRNA and cRNA templates.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "3767-75", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10393191}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0039694", "name" "viral RNA genome replication", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001591", "name" "Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit PB2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
