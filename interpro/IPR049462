{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HpHbR), a protein found within the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from trypanosomes, plays a key role in determining if humans can be infected by these parasites developing sleeping sickness. HpHbR is responsible for the acquisition of haem, an important growth factor for these organism that are deficient in its biosynthesis. This protein folds into an elongated three Î±-helical bundle with a small head structure containing the ligand-binding site that is distal to the C-terminal GPI-anchor attachment site. This structure appears to be conserved among trypanosome species [[cite:PUB00152633], [cite:PUB00152634], [cite:PUB00152635], [cite:PUB00152632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4x0j", "name" "Trypanosoma brucei haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20933" "Haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor", "short" "HpHbR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 27, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049462", :literature {"PUB00152632" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lane-Serff H" "MacGregor P" "Peacock L" "Macleod OJ" "Kay C" "Gibson W" "Higgins MK" "Carrington M."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13044", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Evolutionary diversification of the trypanosome haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor from an ancestral haemoglobin receptor.
