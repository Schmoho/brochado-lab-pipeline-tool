{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This represents the catalytic domain of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase from prokaryotes and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) from eukaryotes ([ec:1.5.1.20]). Both generate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.</p>\n\n<p>Mammalian and yeast MTHFRs are homodimers in which each subunit contains an N-terminal catalytic domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain [(interpro:IPR053806]) to which the allosteric inhibitor adenosylmethionine binds [[cite:PUB00052921]]. NADPH is the preferred reductant. In humans, there are several clinically significant mutations in MTHFR that result in hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease [[cite:PUB00006438]].</p>\n\n<p>The bacterial enzyme is a homotetramer. MTHFRs of enteric bacteria comprise shorter chains around 300 residues in length. Their sequences can be aligned with the N-terminal catalytic domains of the eukaryotic MTHFRs [[cite:PUB00006438]]. Escherichia coli MTHFR, along with plant MTHFRs, prefer NADHs as the source of reducing equivalents [[cite:PUB00052921]]. The structure of E. coli MTHFR is known to be a TIM barrel [[cite:PUB00006438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7th4", "name" "T. thermophilus methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase complex with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029041", "name" "FAD-linked oxidoreductase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00537" "MTHFR"}, "pfam" {"PF02219" "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase-like", "short" "Mehydrof_redctse-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 164, "proteomes" 10396, "taxa" 38774, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50944, "sets" 0, "proteins" 50913, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 37793}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1356", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1356"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
