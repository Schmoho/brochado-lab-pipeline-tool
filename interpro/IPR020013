{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents three closely related flagellar proteins usually denoted FlgE, FlgF and FlgG. The names have often been mis-assigned, however. Three models, [interpro:IPR012835], [interpro:IPR012836] and [interpro:IPR012834], separate the individual forms into three genome-context consistent groups. The major differences between these genes are architectural, with variable central sections between relatively conserved N- and C-terminal domains. More distantly related are two other flagellar apparatus familis, FlgC ([interpro:IPR006299]) which consists of little else but the N- and C-terminal domains and FlgK ([interpro:IPR002371]) with a substantial but different central domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wlg", "name" "Crystal structure of FlgE31, a major fragment of the hook protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037058", "name" "Flagellar hook protein FlgE superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03506" "flagellar hook-basal body complex protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar hook-basal body protein, FlgE/F/G", "short" "Flagellar_FlgE/F/G"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4518, "taxa" 17890, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 79769, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44839}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020013", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020013", "name" "Flagellar hook-basal body protein, FlgE/F/G", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR012834", "name" "Flagellar basal-body rod FlgG", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR012835", "name" "Flagellar hook FlgE", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR012836", "name" "Flagellar basal-body rod FlgF", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
