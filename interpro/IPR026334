{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are very short (~60 residue) polypeptides, among which the fifth and third to last residues are an invariant Phe and invariant Ser, respectively (FXS motif). This motif is a substrate for the modifications introduced by a radical SAM enzyme. The radical SAM enzyme-catalyses the cyclisation by cross-linking the side chains of the first and third residues of tripeptides such as WXN, WXR, FXN or FXS [[cite:PUB00105843], [cite:PUB00152896]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04268" "FxSxx-COOH cyclophane-containing RiPP peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FxSxx-COOH family", "short" "FxSxx-COOH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 255, "taxa" 777, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 804, "sets" 0, "proteins" 804, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 496}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026334", :literature {"PUB00105843" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Ma S" "Chen H" "Li H" "Ji X" "Deng Z" "Ding W" "Zhang Q."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "Post-Translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide-Modifying Radical SAM Enzyme.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "19957-19964", "volume" "60", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34164914}, "PUB00152896" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Nguyen TQN" "Tooh YW" "Sugiyama R" "Nguyen TPD" "Purushothaman M" "Leow LC" "Hanif K" "Yong RHS" "Agatha I" "Winnerdy FR" "Gugger M" "Phan AT" "Morinaka BI."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0519-z", "medline_journal" "Nat Chem", "title" "Post-translational formation of strained cyclophanes in bacteria.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1042-1053", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32807886}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026334", "name" "FxSxx-COOH family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
