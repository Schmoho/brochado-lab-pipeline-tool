{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) K8 proteins. HHV-8 is a human Gammaherpesvirus related to Epstein-Barr virus (strain GD1) (HHV-4) (Human herpesvirus 4) and Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 (Herpesvirus saimiri). HHV-8 open reading frame K8 encodes a basic region-leucine zipper protein of 237 aa that homodimerises. K8 interacts and co-localises with human SNF5 ([interpro:IPR006939]), a cellular chromatin-remodelling factor, both<i>in vivo</i>and<i>in vitro</i>. K8 is thought to function as a transcriptional activator under specific conditions and its transactivation activity requires its interaction with the cellular chromatin remodelling factor hSNF5 [[cite:PUB00013033]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07188" "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K8 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kaposi s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K8", "short" "KSHV_K8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 19, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 74, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
