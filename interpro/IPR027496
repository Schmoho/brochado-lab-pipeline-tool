{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acireductone dioxygenase (ARD/MTND, also known as 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene dioxygenase [ec:1.13.11.54]) is an eukaryotic enzyme that catalyses the formation of formate and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB) from 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene (DHK-MTPene). It shows significant homology to the bacterial acireductone dioxygenase (ARD), which is an enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway (MTA cycle) [[cite:PUB00064756], [cite:PUB00064753], [cite:PUB00100761]]]. MTCBP-1 is necessary for hepatitis C virus replication in an otherwise non-permissive cell line [[cite:PUB00064746]].
