{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a number of type 2 lantibiotic-type bacteriocins, related to but distinct from the family that includes lichenicidin and mersacidin [[cite:PUB00064946]]. Sequence similarity among members consists largely of a 20-residue block of conserved sequence that covers most of the leader peptide region, absent from the mature lantibiotic. This is followed by a region with characteristic composition for lantibiotic precursor regions, rich in Ser and Thr and including a near-invariant Cys near or at the C terminus, involved in cyclization. Members of this family typically are shorter than 70 amino acids.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03893" "lichenicidin A2 family type 2 lantibiotic"}, "pfam" {"PF16934" "Two-component Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin (EFC)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type 2 lantibiotic, A2 family", "short" "Lant_2_A2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 293, "sets" 0, "proteins" 293, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 216}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027632", :literature {"PUB00064946" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Appleyard AN" "Choi S" "Read DM" "Lightfoot A" "Boakes S" "Hoffmann A" "Chopra I" "Bierbaum G" "Rudd BA" "Dawson MJ" "Cortes J."], "ISO_journal" "Chem.
