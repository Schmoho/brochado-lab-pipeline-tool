It also includes CDC48 homologues from Archaea [[cite:PUB00068000]]. These proteins in eukaryotes are involved in the budding and transfer of membrane from the transitional endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The archeal homologue of eukaryotic CDC48/p97 functions with the 20S proteasome by unfolding substrates and passing them on for degradation [[cite:PUB00093689]]. CDC48 consists of an N-terminal domain that binds two hexameric ATPase rings (D1 and D2) surrounding a central pore [[cite:PUB00093691]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01243" "CDC48 family AAA ATPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AAA ATPase, CDC48 family", "short" "AAA_ATPase_CDC48"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 110, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2895, "taxa" 11538, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11661, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8434}, "pathways" 95}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
