{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arylsulphatase from the multicellular green flagellate Volvox carteri is a 649 amino acid polypeptide [[cite:PUB00016065]]. Like arylsulphatases in other organisms, it occurs in the periplasm. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, however, this enzyme does not appear to be periplasmic or membrane-associated [[cite:PUB00043515]]. \r\n\r\nThe synthesis of arylsufatase is repressed when sulphate, cysteine or thiocyanate is the only source for growth. A post-translational protein modification where a cysteine is replaced by a serinesemialdehydepresence has been described in two human sulphatases and in V. carteri. This modification is required for the catalytic activity of sulphatases and may be present in all sulphatases of eukaryotic origin [[cite:PUB00001466]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000972" "Arylsulphatase, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arylsulfatase", "short" "Arylsulfatase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 624, "taxa" 1618, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1681, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1565, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 979}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
