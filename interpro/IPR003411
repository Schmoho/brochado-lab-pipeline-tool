{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include TGBp3 proteins found in many plant viruses. Triple gene block 3 proteins (TGBp3) are involved in virus momvement. TGBp3 is an integral ER membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal region exposed to the cytosol. TGBp3 is able to target TGBp2 to the cortical ER tubules of the cell periphery through the sorting signal in the C-terminal region of TGBp3. Moreover, it plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent plasmodesmata (PD) localization of TGBp1; however, the enhancement is abolished when one of the two conserved Cys residues in the C-terminal region of TGBp3 is replaced with Ala [[cite:PUB00091026]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02495" "Triple gene block 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Triple gene block 3", "short" "TGBp3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 122, "taxa" 302, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1345, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003411", :literature {"PUB00091026" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ho TL" "Lee HC" "Chou YL" "Tseng YH" "Huang WC" "Wung CH" "Lin NS" "Hsu YH" "Chang BY."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.11.005", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "The cysteine residues at the C-terminal tail of Bamboo mosaic virus triple gene block protein 2 are critical for efficient plasmodesmata localization of protein 1 in the same block.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "47-53", "volume" "501", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27863274}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003411", "name" "Triple gene block 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 60, "alignment:full" 95}}}
