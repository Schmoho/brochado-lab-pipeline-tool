{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Profilin is a small eukaryotic protein that binds to monomeric actin (G-actin) in a 1:1 ratio thus preventing the polymerisation of actin into filaments (F-actin). It can also in certain circumstance promote actin polymerisation. Profilin also binds to polyphosphoinositides such as PIP2. Overall sequence similarity among profilin from organisms which belong to different phyla (ranging from fungi to mammals) is low, but the N-terminal region is relatively well conserved. That region is thought to be involved in the binding to actin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents a profilin, apicomplexa type.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3nec", "name" "Crystal Structure of Toxoplasma gondii Profilin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036140", "name" "Profilin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF022993" "Profilin, apicomplexa type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Profilin, apicomplexa", "short" "Profilin_apicomplexa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 35, "taxa" 122, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 116, "sets" 0, "proteins" 115, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 110}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016814", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003779", "name" "actin binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0030036", "name" "actin cytoskeleton organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048278", "name" "Profilin", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005455", "name" "Profilin, eukaryotic type", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005454", "name" "Profilin1/2/3, vertebrate", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR016814", "name" "Profilin, apicomplexa", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
