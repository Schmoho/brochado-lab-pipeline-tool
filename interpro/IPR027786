{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in the NSE4/EID (Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes element 4/EP300-interacting inhibitor of differentiation 3) family are components of the Smc5/6 complex that is involved in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. The complex may promote sister chromatid homologous recombination by recruiting the SMC1-SMC3 cohesin complex to double-strand breaks. The complex is required for telomere maintenance via recombination and mediates sumoylation of shelterin complex (telosome) components [[cite:PUB00062983], [cite:PUB00045053], [cite:PUB00062984]]. In human, it acts as a repressor of nuclear receptor-dependent transcription possibly by interfering with CREBBP-dependent coactivation. It may function as a coinhibitor of other CREBBP/EP300-dependent transcription factors [[cite:PUB00062983]].</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, there is a single NSE4 gene in most eukaryotes up to non-placental mammals while there are several NSE4/EID copies in placental mammals [[cite:PUB00069904]]. In humans, there are two NSE4 proteins, NSE4a and NSE4b/EID3. They contain both N and C-terminal kleisin domains. Their N-terminal domain binds to SMC6 neck and bridges it to the SMC5 head [[cite:PUB00095748]] and to the Nse3 (another SMC5-6 complex subunit) pocket [[cite:PUB00069905]], which seems to increased the stability of the ATP-free SMC5/6 complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16140" "NON-STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOMES ELEMENT 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nse4/EID family", "short" "Nse4/EID"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2429, "taxa" 8187, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4683, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4683, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3037}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027786", :literature {"PUB00062983" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Bavner A" "Matthews J" "Sanyal S" "Gustafsson JA" "Treuter E."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki667", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "EID3 is a novel EID family member and an inhibitor of CBP-dependent co-activation.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "3561-9", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15987788}, "PUB00062984" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Bermudez-Lopez M" "Ceschia A" "de Piccoli G" "Colomina N" "Pasero P" "Aragon L" "Torres-Rosell J."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq546", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The Smc5/6 complex is required for dissolution of DNA-mediated sister chromatid linkages.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "6502-12", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20571088}, "PUB00045053" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hu B" "Liao C" "Millson SH" "Mollapour M" "Prodromou C" "Pearl LH" "Piper PW" "Panaretou B."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
