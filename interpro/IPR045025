{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of TPP-binding domain containing proteins, including oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase from E. coli, IorA from Thermococcus kodakarensis and HACL1 from animals. In general, they are thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes that catalyse the carbon-carbon bond cleavage [[cite:PUB00097740]]. In humans, HACL1 is a peroxisomal 2-OH acyl-CoA lyase involved in the cleavage (C1 removal) reaction in the fatty acid alpha-oxidation in a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00097740], [cite:PUB00097741], [cite:PUB00097742]]. It is also involved in the degradation of 3-methyl-branched fatty acids like phytanic acid and the shortening of 2-hydroxy long-chain fatty acids [[cite:PUB00097740], [cite:PUB00097741], [cite:PUB00097742]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6xn8", "name" "Crystal Structure of 2-hydroxyacyl CoA lyase (HACL) from Rhodospirillales bacterium URHD0017"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43710" "2-HYDROXYACYL-COA LYASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TPP-binding domain containing protein HACL1-like", "short" "HACL1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3334, "taxa" 14855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17423, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17423, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12786}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
