{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a central step in energy metabolism, can occur by two different mechanisms [[cite:PUB00028096]]. In mitochondria and aerobic bacteria this reaction is catalysed by the multienzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase using NAD as electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms, however, this reaction is reversibly catalysed by a single enzyme using either ferrodoxin or flavodoxin as the electron acceptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pyruvate:ferrodoxin/flavodoxin reductases (PFORs) in this entry occur in both obligately and facultatively anaerobic bacteria and also some eukaryotic microorganisms. These proteins are single-chain enzymes containing a thiamin pyrophosphate cofactor for the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds next to a carbonyl group, and iron-sulphur clusters for electron transfer. The Desulfovibrio africanus enzyme is currently the only PFOR whose three dimensional structure is known [[cite:PUB00005843], [cite:PUB00011733]]. It is a homodimer where each subunit contains one thiamin pyrophosphate cofactor and two ferrodoxin-like 4Fe-S clusters and an atypical 4Fe-S cluster. Each monomer is composed of seven domains - domains I, II and VI make intersubunit contacts, while domains III, IV and V are located at the surface of the dimer, and domain VII forms a long arm extending over the other subunit. The cofactor is bound at the interface of domains I and VI and is proximal to the atypical 4Fe-S bound by domain VI, while the ferrodoxin-like 4Fe-S clusters are bound by domain V. Comparison of this enzyme with the multi-chain PFORs shows a correspondence between the domains in this enzyme and the subunits of the multi-chain enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2c42", "name" "Crystal Structure Of Pyruvate-Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase From Desulfovibrio africanus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037112", "name" "Pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase, EKR domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02176" "pyruvate:ferredoxin (flavodoxin) oxidoreductase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000159" "Pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase", "short" "Pyrv_flavodox_OxRed"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2078, "taxa" 10216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12847, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12817, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9407}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0841", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0841"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
