PGFS, also called 9,11-endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 reductase, catalyses the NADP-dependent formation of prostaglandin F2-alpha from prostaglandin H2.

However, there are some exceptions, such as the reduction of steroid double bonds catalysed by AKR1D enzymes (5beta-reductases); and the oxidation of proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; while the beta-subunits of potassium gated ion channels (AKR6 family) control Kv channel opening [[cite:PUB00096110]].</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, they contain an (α/β)8-barrel motif, display large loops at the back of the barrel which govern substrate specificity, and have a conserved cofactor binding domain. The binding site is located in a large, deep, elliptical pocket in the C-terminal end of the β-sheet, the substrate being bound in an extended conformation. The hydrophobic nature of the pocket favours aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar ones [[cite:PUB00005156]]. They catalyse an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which NAD(P)H cofactor binds first and leaves last [[cite:PUB00096110]]. Binding of the NADPH coenzyme causes a massive conformational change, reorienting a loop, effectively locking the coenzyme in place. This binding is more similar to FAD- than to NAD(P)-binding oxidoreductases [[cite:PUB00002751]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4f40", "name" "X-ray crystal structure of Apo prostaglandin f synthase from Leishmania major Friedlin"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036812", "name" "NADP-dependent oxidoreductase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd19156" "AKR5A family of aldo-keto reductase (AKR)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aldo-keto reductase family 5A", "short" "AKR5A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 72, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 61, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 46}, "pathways" 147}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
