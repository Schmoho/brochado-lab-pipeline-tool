{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes 3-dehydroquinate synthase and 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase, both belonging to the 3-dehydroquinate synthase family. 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase catalyses the intramolecular carbocycle formation from D-glucose-6-phosphate to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) [[cite:PUB00074328]]. 3-dehydroquinate synthase catalyses the formation of dehydroquinate (DHQ) and orthophosphate from 3-deoxy-D-arabino heptulosonic 7 phosphate [[cite:PUB00003775]]. This reaction is part of the shikimate pathway which is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids.</p>\n<p>This entry also matches 2-epi-valiolone synthase (EVS). Together with 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthases (EEVS) and desmethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthases (DDGS), EVS is part of the subgroup of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate cyclases found in DHQS-like proteins. EVS allows the synthesis of 2-epi-valiolone (2EV) from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, predicted to be an alternative precursor of the aminocyclitol biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00094159]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ujn", "name" "Crystal structure of dehydroquinate synthase from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001455" "3-dehydroquinate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-dehydroquinate synthase family", "short" "DHQ_synth_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8101, "taxa" 31112, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35609, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35531, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27082}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
