{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes M2 protein from Vaccinia virus, also known as Early protein OPG038, and similar proteins from poxvirus. M2 plays a role in immune evasion. When secreted, inhibits T-cell activation by preventing the binding of host CD80 and CD86 to soluble CTLA4 and CD28 [[cite:PUB00103598]]. In the infected cell, it may inhibit host NF kappa B activation  [[cite:PUB00103597],  [cite:PUB00103599]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04887" "Poxvirus M2 protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015982" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, VAC_M2L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus M2", "short" "Poxvirus_M2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 72, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 96, "sets" 0, "proteins" 96, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006971", :literature {"PUB00103599" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Gedey R" "Jin XL" "Hinthong O" "Shisler JL."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Poxviral regulation of the host NF-kappaB response: the vaccinia virus M2L protein inhibits induction of NF-kappaB activation via an ERK2 pathway in virus-infected human embryonic kidney cells.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "8676-85", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16912315}, "PUB00103597" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hinthong O" "Jin XL" "Shisler JL."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Characterization of wild-type and mutant vaccinia virus M2L proteins' abilities to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and to inhibit NF-kappaB activation during infection.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "248-62", "volume" "373", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18190944}, "PUB00103598" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kleinpeter P" "Remy-Ziller C" "Winter E" "Gantzer M" "Nourtier V" "Kempf J" "Hortelano J" "Schmitt D" "Schultz H" "Geist M" "Brua C" "Hoffmann C" "Schlesinger Y" "Villeval D" "Thioudellet C" "Erbs P" "Foloppe J" "Silvestre N" "Fend L" "Quemeneur E" "Marchand JB."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "By Binding CD80 and CD86, the Vaccinia Virus M2 Protein Blocks Their Interactions with both CD28 and CTLA4 and Potentiates CD80 Binding to PD-L1.
