{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the (5-formylfuran-3-yl)methyl phosphate synthase (also known as 4-HFC-P synthase or MfnB), which has a classical TIM-barrel structure whose biological unit is a homohexamer. It is involved in the production of methanofuran. MfnB from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii catalyzed at least 10 separate chemical reactions in converting two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-P (GA-3-P) to 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde-P (4-HFC-P), the first discrete intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway to the furan moiety of the coenzyme methanofuran [[cite:PUB00077121]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4u9p", "name" "Structure of the methanofuran/methanopterin biosynthetic enzyme MJ1099 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00681" "(5-formylfuran-3-yl)methyl phosphate synthase [mfnB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "(5-formylfuran-3-yl)methyl phosphate synthase, archaea", "short" "4HFCP_synth_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 496, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 453, "sets" 0, "proteins" 453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 397}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
