{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SwrA is a transcription factor involved in swarming motility (a multicellular movement of hyper-flagellated cells on a surface). It acts synergistically with DegU to drive the fla/che operon encoding flagella components, chemotaxis constituents and the alternative sigma factor sigmaD, which is regarded as the primary event in the development of motility [[cite:PUB00085351]]. LonA protease of Bacillus subtilis inhibits SwrA by proteolytically restricting its accumulation [[cite:PUB00085352]]. SwrA does not contain any known DNA binding domain, and it has been shown to interact with the N-terminal domain of DegU. Anecdotally, in most laboratory strains, e.g. 168, the swrA coding sequence contains a nucleotide insertion that prematurely interrupts its reading frame, causing a non-swarming phenotype strain [[cite:PUB00085353]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17423" "Swarming motility protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Swarming motility protein SwrA", "short" "SwrA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 85, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 84, "sets" 0, "proteins" 84, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035388", :literature {"PUB00085351" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ogura M" "Tsukahara K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
