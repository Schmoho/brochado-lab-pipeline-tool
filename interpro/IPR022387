{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein are the substrate-binding protein of a predicted carbohydrate transporter operon, together with permease subunits of ABC transporter homology families. This substrate-binding protein frequently co-occurs in genomes with a family of disaccharide phosphorylases, [ncbifam:TIGR02336], suggesting that the molecule transported will include beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and related carbohydrates. Members of this family are sporadically strain by strain, often in species with a human host association, including Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium perfringens (protein CPR_0540, which gives its name to the group), and Bacillus cereus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes across the cytoplasmic membrane.

In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03850" "carbohydrate ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbohydrate ABC transporter substrate-binding, CPR0540", "short" "Bind_CPR0540"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 213, "taxa" 761, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 639, "sets" 0, "proteins" 639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 479}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022387", :literature {"PUB00071938" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Saurin W" "Dassa E."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.5560030216", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Sequence relationships between integral inner membrane proteins of binding protein-dependent transport systems: evolution by recurrent gene duplications.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "325-44", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8003968}, "PUB00071925" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 3", "authors" ["Singh B" "Rohm KH."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2007/013185-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Characterization of a Pseudomonas putida ABC transporter (AatJMQP) required for acidic amino acid uptake: biochemical properties and regulation by the Aau two-component system.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "797-809", "volume" "154", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18310026}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006059", "name" "Bacterial-type extracellular solute-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR001188", "name" "Spermidine/putrescine-binding periplasmic protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006060", "name" "Maltose/Cyclodextrin ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR014597", "name" "ABC transporter, periplasmic substrate-binding protein, predicted", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022386", "name" "Carbohydrate ABC transporter, N-acetylglucosamine/diacetylchitobiose-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022387", "name" "Carbohydrate ABC transporter substrate-binding, CPR0540", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
