{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of zinc finger protein ZPR1 and ZPR1-like proteins. The function of ZPR1 from archaea and eukaryotes is not yet clear. However, Zpr1 from yeast acts as a protein folding chaperone for elongation factor 1-alpha [[cite:PUB00103908]]. ZPR1 is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and its subcellular distribution changes during proliferation [[cite:PUB00035839]]. ZPR1 binds to the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [[cite:PUB00017397]] and is a component of downstream signalling of both EGFR and FGFR signalling [[cite:PUB00090578]]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes, an interaction that is essential for normal cellular proliferation [[cite:PUB00020594]]. It has been associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes [[cite:PUB00090579]] and is downregulated in patients with spinal muscular atrophy [[cite:PUB00090579]]. ZPR1 interacts with complexes formed by SMN [[cite:PUB00035839]], and may act as a modifier that affects the severity of SMA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2qkd", "name" "Crystal structure of tandem ZPR1 domains"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042451", "name" "ZPR1, A/B domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042452", "name" "ZPR1, zinc finger domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10876" "ZINC FINGER PROTEIN ZPR1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ZPR1", "short" "ZPR1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2698, "taxa" 9916, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6383, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6383, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4404}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040141", :literature {"PUB00103908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sabbarini IM" "Reif D" "McQuown AJ" "Nelliat AR" "Prince J" "Membreno BS" "Wu CC" "Murray AW" "Denic V."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Zinc-finger protein Zpr1 is a bespoke chaperone essential for eEF1A biogenesis.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "252-265.e13", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36630955}, "PUB00090578" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Ruiz OE" "Nikolova LS" "Metzstein MM."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0045649", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Drosophila Zpr1 (Zinc finger protein 1) is required downstream of both EGFR and FGFR signaling in tracheal subcellular lumen formation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e45649", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23029159}, "PUB00090579" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Guan F" "Niu Y" "Zhang T" "Liu S" "Ma L" "Qi T" "Feng J" "Zuo H" "Li G" "Liu X" "Wang S."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep29586", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Two-stage association study to identify the genetic susceptibility of a novel common variant of rs2075290 in ZPR1 to type 2 diabetes.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "29586", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27411854}, "PUB00017397" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5269", "authors" ["Galcheva-Gargova Z" "Konstantinov KN" "Wu IH" "Klier FG" "Barrett T" "Davis RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/272/5269/1797", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Binding of zinc finger protein ZPR1 to the epidermal growth factor receptor.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "1797-802", "volume" "272", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8650580}, "PUB00035839" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Gangwani L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
