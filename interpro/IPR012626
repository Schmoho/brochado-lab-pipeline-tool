{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of insecticidal peptides isolated from venom of spiders of  Aptostichus schlingeri (Trap-door spider) and Calisoga sp. Nine insecticidal peptides were isolated from the venom of the A. schlinger spider and seven of these toxins cause flaccid paralysis to insect larvae within 10 min of injection. However, all nine peptides were lethal within 24 hours [[cite:PUB00016363]]. The structure of Aps III was solved and shown to be an atypical knottin peptide with four disulphide bridges [[cite:PUB00075632]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08091" "Spider insecticidal peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spider insecticidal peptide", "short" "Spider_insecticidal_peptide"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 89, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012626", :literature {"PUB00016363" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Skinner WS" "Dennis PA" "Li JP" "Quistad GB."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0041-0101(92)90049-B", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "Identification of insecticidal peptides from venom of the trap-door spider, Aptostichus schlingeri (Ctenizidae).", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "1043-50", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1440641}, "PUB00075632" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Bende NS" "Kang E" "Herzig V" "Bosmans F" "Nicholson GM" "Mobli M" "King GF."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
