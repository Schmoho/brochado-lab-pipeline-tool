{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lon protease belongs to the S16 peptidase family and is an ATP-dependent serine protease that mediates the selective degradation of mutant and abnormal proteins, as well as certain short-lived regulatory proteins. It is required for cellular homeostasis and for survival from DNA damage and developmental changes induced by stress [[cite:PUB00062807]]. In pathogenic bacteria, it is required for the expression of virulence genes that promote cell infection [[cite:PUB00062804]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lon (La) protease was the first ATP-dependent protease to be purified from\r\nE. coli [[cite:PUB00000452], [cite:PUB00002455], [cite:PUB00001838], [cite:PUB00002806]]. The enzyme is a homotetramer of 87kDa subunits, with one proteolytic and one ATP-binding site per monomer, making it structurally less complex than other known ATP-dependent proteases [[cite:PUB00002455]]. Despite this relative structural simplicity, Lon recognises its substrates directly, without delegating the task of substrate recognition to other enzymes [[cite:PUB00002455]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This signature defines the bacterial and eukaryotic lon proteases.
