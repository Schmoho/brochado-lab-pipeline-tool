{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Queuosine salvage proteins occur in most Eukarya as well as in a few bacteria possible via horizontal gene-transfer. Queuosine (Q) is a chemical modification found at the wobble position of tRNAs that have GUN anticodons, and it ensures faithful translation of the respective C- and U-ending codons. Most bacteria synthesize queuosine de novo, whereas eukaryotes rely solely on salvaging this essential component from the environment or the gut flora. This entry represents queuosine salvage proteins (Qng1, also known as DUF2419) which have been identified as a queuosine nucleoside glycosylases that play an essential role in allowing eukaryotic cells to salvage Q from bacterial sources and to recycle Q from endogenous tRNAs [[cite:PUB00075552], [cite:PUB00101386] ,[cite:PUB00151125]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ugk", "name" "Crystal structure of the human queuine salvage enzyme DUF2419, wild-type apo form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10343" "Queuosine salvage protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR21314" "QUEUOSINE 5'-PHOSPHATE N-GLYCOSYLASE_HYDROLASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Queuosine salvage protein family", "short" "Q_salvage"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 88, "proteomes" 2442, "taxa" 9026, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5428, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5247, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3466}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
