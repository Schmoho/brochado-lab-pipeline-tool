{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of enzymes belongs to the GHMP kinase domain superfamily. GHMP kinases are a unique class of ATP-dependent enzymes (the abbreviation of which refers to the original members: galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) [[cite:PUB00015675]]. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily contain three well-conserved motifs, the second of which has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala and is involved in ATP binding [[cite:PUB00015644]]. The phosphate binding loop in GHMP kinases is distinct from the classical P-loops found in many ATP/GTP binding proteins. The bound ADP molecule adopts a rare syn conformation and is in the opposite orientation from those bound to the P-loop-containing proteins [[cite:PUB00015644]]. GHMP kinases display a distinctly bilobal appearance with their N-terminal subdomains dominated by a mixed β-sheet flanked on one side by α-helices and their C-terminal subdomains containing a four stranded anti-parallel β-sheet [[cite:PUB00015835], [cite:PUB00015644], [cite:PUB00015669], [cite:PUB00015730]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2gs8", "name" "Structure of mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase from Streptococcus pyogenes"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR020568", "name" "Ribosomal protein uS5 domain 2-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR014721", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5 domain 2-type fold, subgroup", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01240" "diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase", "short" "Mev_diP_decarb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3179, "taxa" 12296, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8339, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8338, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5819}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0047", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0047"} {"accession" "GenProp1432", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1432"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
