{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The CutA family of proteins which exhibit ion tolerance are found in a large variety of species [[cite:PUB00014093]]. In E.Coli, two operons on the cutA locus contain genes that encode three proteins, CutA1, CutA2 and CutA3. CutA1 proteins are found in the cytoplasm while CutA2 (50kDa) and CutA3 (24kDa) are located in the inner membrane. Although the role of E. Coli CutA1 is not clear, studies on E. coli cutA locus describe some mutations that lead to an increase in copper sensitivity, thus suggesting a role in ion tolerance [[cite:PUB00007507]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, the structure of CutA proteins from several species have been solved [[cite:PUB00022783], [cite:PUB00028855]]. The crystal structures of the E.Coli and rat CutA1 proteins show both these proteins to be trimeric in the crystal as well as in solution[[cite:PUB00014093]].Trimerisation seems to supported by the formation of Î² sheets between the subunit. This trimeric structure suggests the protein may be involved in signal transduction due to architectural similarities with PII signal transducer proteins [[cite:PUB00014093]].\r\nRecent studies propose that mammalian CutA1 in the neuronal cell membrane acts as an anchor for acetylcholinesterase (AChE)1 [[cite:PUB00056052]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1uku", "name" "Crystal Structure of Pyrococcus horikoshii CutA1 Complexed with Cu2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015867", "name" "Nitrogen regulatory protein PII/ATP phosphoribosyltransferase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011322", "name" "Nitrogen regulatory PII-like, alpha/beta", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03091" "CutA1 divalent ion tolerance protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR23419" "DIVALENT CATION TOLERANCE CUTA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Divalent ion tolerance protein, CutA", "short" "Ion_tolerance_CutA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 43, "domain_architectures" 107, "proteomes" 4354, "taxa" 19855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19589, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19503, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14517}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004323", :literature {"PUB00007507" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Gupta SD" "Wu HC" "Rick PD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
