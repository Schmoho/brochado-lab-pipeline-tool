{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of Hcp-like proteins. Hcp is part of the type VI secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria. Hcp is not only a secreted effector protein, but also might act as machine component [[cite:PUB00067804], [cite:PUB00054686], [cite:PUB00155386]].</p>\n\n<p>Several bacterial pathogens mediate interactions with their hosts through protein secretion, often involving Hcp-like virulence loci, which are widely distributed among pathogenic bacteria. Homologues of Hcp are found in various bacteria of which most, but not all, are known pathogens. Many bacteria have two copies of hcp genes [[cite:PUB00067810], [cite:PUB00067811]]. In Pseudomonas syringae, Hcp1 is a virulence protein, while Hcp2 seems to be required for survival in competition with enterobacteria and yeasts, and its function is associated with the suppression of the growth of these competitors [[cite:PUB00067803]].</p>\n\n<p>Hcp1 monomers form a hexameric ring with a large internal diameter. Assembly of this particle is likely to occur following secretion, and could have a role in building a channel for the transport of other macromolecules [[cite:PUB00034462]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a supra-molecular bacterial complex that resembles phage tails.
