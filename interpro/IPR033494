{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes nuclear distribution element 1 (NDE1) and NDE-like 1 (NDEL1). Human NDE1 and NDEL1 are believed to be evolved from a common ancestral gene, such as the NudE gene of Aspergillus nidulans. They share protein sequence and structure similarities and have overlapping functions in the cell and developing brain. They are essential for mitosis and neurodevelopment [[cite:PUB00078939]]. They both interact with LIS1 through their N-terminal domain, and this interaction stimulates the movement of dynein. However, their expression and post-translational modification within the cell are different [[cite:PUB00078935]]. This entry also includes Emericella nidulans NUDE, which is required for nuclear migration within hyphae during vegetative growth [[cite:PUB00099686], [cite:PUB00099687]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6kzj", "name" "Crystal structure of Ankyrin B/NdeL1 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10921" "NUCLEAR DISTRIBUTION PROTEIN NUDE HOMOLOG 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NUDE family", "short" "NUDE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2108, "taxa" 6871, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5478, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5478, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3588}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033494", :literature {"PUB00078935" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bradshaw NJ" "Hennah W" "Soares DC."], "ISO_journal" "Biomol Concepts", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bmc-2013-0023", "medline_journal" "Biomol Concepts", "title" "NDE1 and NDEL1: twin neurodevelopmental proteins with similar 'nature' but different 'nurture'.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "447-64", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24093049}, "PUB00078939" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Soares DC" "Bradshaw NJ" "Zou J" "Kennaway CK" "Hamilton RS" "Chen ZA" "Wear MA" "Blackburn EA" "Bramham J" "Bottcher B" "Millar JK" "Barlow PN" "Walkinshaw MD" "Rappsilber J" "Porteous DJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
