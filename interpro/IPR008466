{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 (IPP-1) family, which consists of PPP1R1A/B/C. They are involved in signal transduction and are endogenous inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 [[cite:PUB00011307]]. PPP1R1B, also known as DARPP-32, has a key role in many neurotransmitter pathways throughout the brain and has been shown to be involved in controlling receptors, ion channels and other physiological factors including the brain's response to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, opiates and nicotine. If phosphorylated, DARPP-32 can inhibit protein-phosphatase-1 [[cite:PUB00011308]]. DARPP-32 is reciprocally regulated by the two neurotransmitters that are most often implicated in schizophrenia - dopamine and glutamate. Dopamine activates DARPP-32 through the D1 receptor pathway and disables DARPP-32 through the D2 receptor. Glutamate, acting through the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, renders DARPP-32 inactive. A mutant form of DARPP-32 has been linked with gastric cancers [[cite:PUB00011310]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05395" "Protein phosphatase inhibitor 1/DARPP-32"}, "panther" {"PTHR15417" "PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE INHIBITOR AND DOPAMINE- AND CAMP-REGULATED NEURONAL PHOSPHOPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase inhibitor 1", "short" "PPP1R1A/B/C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 639, "taxa" 2198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2664, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2555, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1672}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008466", :literature {"PUB00011307" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["McLaren L" "Boyle S" "Mason JO" "Bard JB."], "ISO_journal" "Mech.
