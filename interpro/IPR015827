{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Alpha-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase Fut8 catalyses the alpha1,6-linkage of a fucose residue from a donor substrate to N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins in a process called core fucosylation, which is crucial for growth factor receptor-mediated biological functions. Fut8-deficient mice show severe growth retardation, early death, and a pulmonary emphysema-like phenotype [[cite:PUB00085809]]. Fut8 is also implicated to play roles in ageing [[cite:PUB00085810]] and cancer metastasis [[cite:PUB00085811]]. It contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. The SH3 domain of Fut8 is located in the lumen and its role in glycosyl transfer is unclear [[cite:PUB00040227]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vlf", "name" "Crystal structure of mouse alpha 1,6-fucosyltransferase, FUT8 in its Apo-form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000472" "Alpha-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase, eukaryotic type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase", "short" "Fut8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 631, "taxa" 2635, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1118, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 739}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
