{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) is responsible for effective DNA replication, playing a key role in the elongation of both the leading and the lagging strands of DNA and the maturation of Okazaki fragments [[cite:PUB00092483]]. It consists of four subunits: the catalytic and largest subunit p125, p50 that interacts with p125 to form the core enzyme, p68 which interacts with p50, and a fourth subunit, p12, that bridges p125 and p50, stabilising its interaction [[cite:PUB00092482], [cite:PUB00094535]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the p12 subunit (also called subunit 4), which increases the rate of DNA synthesis and decreases fidelity by regulating POLD1 polymerase and proofreading 3' to 5' exonuclease activity in the Pol delta4 tetramer complex [[cite:PUB00092482], [cite:PUB00094535], [cite:PUB00094534]]. p12 is PCNA-binding protein, as it contains a N-terminal PCNA-binding motif. Under conditions of DNA replication stress, it is required for the repair of broken replication forks through break-induced replication (BIR), a mechanism that may induce segmental genomic duplications of up to 200 kb [[cite:PUB00094537]]. This subunit is involved in Pol-delta4 translesion synthesis (TLS) of templates carrying O6-methylguanine or abasic sites [[cite:PUB00094535]]. p12 plays a major role in Pol delta4 catalytic functions while its degradation is required for the conversion of Pol delta4 to Pol delta3 in the cellular response to DNA damage, as Pol delta3 has an enhanced proofreading activity [[cite:PUB00094536]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14303" "DNA POLYMERASE DELTA SUBUNIT 4"}, "pfam" {"PF04081" "DNA polymerase delta, subunit 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase delta, subunit 4", "short" "DNA_pol_delta_4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 54, "proteomes" 1738, "taxa" 5663, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2926, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2910, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1856}, "pathways" 47}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007218", :literature {"PUB00094536" {"URL" nil, "issue" "42", "authors" ["Terai K" "Shibata E" "Abbas T" "Dutta A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
