{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family trimethylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3 using monomethylated H3 'Lys-9' as substrate, including histone-lysine N-methyltransferase Su(var)3-9 from Drosophila melanogaster and its orthologue from human, SUV39H1. SUV39H1 also weakly methylates histone H1 (in vitro). H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting HP1 (CBX1, CBX3 and/or CBX5) proteins to methylated histones. This enzyme mainly functions in heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin at pericentric and telomere regions. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation is also required to direct DNA methylation at pericentric repeats [[cite:PUB00058070], [cite:PUB00058071], [cite:PUB00058072]].</p>\n\n<p>SUV39H1 is targeted to histone H3 via its interaction with RB1 and is involved in many processes, such as repression of MYOD1-stimulated differentiation[[cite:PUB00058077]], regulation of the control switch for exiting the cell cycle and entering differentiation, repression by the PML-RARA fusion protein [[cite:PUB00058078]], BMP-induced repression, repression of switch recombination to IgA [[cite:PUB00058079]] and regulation of telomere length [[cite:PUB00058073], [cite:PUB00058080]]. SUV39H1 is a component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD+/NADP+ ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus [[cite:PUB00050320]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (EC [ec:2.1.1.-]) constitute an important class of enzymes present in every life form.

All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]]. The substrates that are methylated by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small molecules, to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00006319]]. Methyltransferase are therefore involved in many essential cellular processes including biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]].
