{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ca2+ ions are unique in that they not only carry charge but they are also the most widely used of diffusible second messengers. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) are a family of molecules that allow cells to couple electrical activity to intracellular Ca2+ signalling. The opening and closing of these channels by depolarizing stimuli, such as action potentials, allows Ca2+ ions to enter neurons down a steep electrochemical gradient, producing transient intracellular Ca2+ signals. Many of the processes that occur in neurons, including transmitter release, gene transcription and metabolism are controlled by Ca2+ influx occurring simultaneously at different cellular locales. The pore is formed by the alpha-1 subunit which incorporates the conduction pore, the voltage sensor and gating apparatus, and the known sites of channel regulation by second messengers, drugs, and toxins [[cite:PUB00036034]]. The activity of this pore is modulated by four tightly-coupled subunits: an intracellular beta subunit; a transmembrane gamma subunit; and a disulphide-linked complex of alpha-2 and delta subunits, which are proteolytically cleaved from the same gene product. Properties of the protein including gating voltage-dependence, G protein modulation and kinase susceptibility can be influenced by these subunits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voltage-gated calcium channels are classified as T, L, N, P, Q and R, and are distinguished by their sensitivity to pharmacological blocks, single-channel conductance kinetics, and voltage-dependence. On the basis of their voltage activation properties, the voltage-gated calcium classes can be further divided into two broad groups: the low (T-type) and high (L, N, P, Q and R-type)                threshold-activated channels.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Co-expression of beta subunit mRNA with alpha-1 subunit mRNA in xenopus oocytes produces increased calcium currents, which are accompanied by a shift in the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative membrane potentials. Conversely, microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides to beta subunit mRNA produces decreased calcium currents and shifts voltage-dependent activation to more positive membrane potentials.  There are four distinct beta subunits: beta-1, beta-2, beta-3 and beta-4; and the magnitude of the shift in the voltage-dependence of activation of change to membrane potentials varies with the particular subtype [[cite:PUB00007090]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>There are 3 splice variants of the beta-1 subunit: beta-1a, beta-1b and beta 1c. Beta-1a is the most extensively studied of these and is known to be expressed in skeletal muscle and brain, but not in smooth muscle or heart. Beta-1a appears to be important for the functional expression of the alpha-1 subunit in skeletal muscle. It is a 524-residue peripheral membrane protein that associates with a conserved 9-residue motif between repeats I and II of the alpha-1 subunit [[cite:PUB00007828]]. Beta-1b was identified by cloning in rat brain, heart and hippocampus, and differs from beta-1a by having a deletion of ~50 amino acids at residue 209, and having a 120-residue C-terminal elongation. Beta-1c was cloned from human heart and hippocampus and has the same deletion as beta-1b, but lacks the C-terminal extension.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036028", "name" "SH3-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01627" "LCACHANNELB1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Voltage-dependent calcium channel, L-type, beta-1 subunit", "short" "VDCC_L_b1su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 346, "taxa" 1375, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3956, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1340, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 768}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005443", :literature {"PUB00007828" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Neuhuber B" "Gerster U" "Doring F" "Glossmann H" "Tanabe T" "Flucher BE."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
