{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\n\n<p>Interleukin-24 (IL-24, also known as melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7) belongs to the family of IL-10-related cytokines, which includes IL-10, -19, -20, -22, -24 and -26 [[cite:PUB00046044]]. It has been proposed, based on the expression pattern of IL-24 and its receptors, that the cytokine may play a role in epidermal functions, such as wound healing [[cite:PUB00046070]]. IL-24 has also been shown to possess cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing activity, and has therefore been suggested as a potential anti-cancer agent [[cite:PUB00046071]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents interleukin-24.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01937" "Interleukin-24"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-24", "short" "IL-24"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 538, "taxa" 1855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2459, "sets" 0, "proteins" 874, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 619}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020444", :literature {"PUB00046044" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Fickenscher H" "Hor S" "Kupers H" "Knappe A" "Wittmann S" "Sticht H."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Immunol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1471-4906(01)02149-4", "medline_journal" "Trends Immunol", "title" "The interleukin-10 family of cytokines.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "89-96", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11929132}, "PUB00046070" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wang M" "Liang P."], "ISO_journal" "Immunology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2005.02094.x", "medline_journal" "Immunology", "title" "Interleukin-24 and its receptors.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "166-70", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15667561}, "PUB00046071" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4 Suppl 1", "authors" ["Fisher PB" "Gopalkrishnan RV" "Chada S" "Ramesh R" "Grimm EA" "Rosenfeld MR" "Curiel DT" "Dent P."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Biol.
