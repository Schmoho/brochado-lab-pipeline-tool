{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of lipid droplet-associated proteins from actinomycetes, including [swissprot:Q0S490] from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, which has been shown to associate specifically with lipid droplets [[cite:PUB00105220], [cite:PUB00105219]], and it orthologue [swissprot:P9WM59] from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These lipid droplets consist of a neutral lipid core enveloped by a phospholipid monolayer and surface proteins. Lipid droplets of triacylglycerol can be especially prominent in proteins from the genus Rhodococcus, but occur also in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and can support dormancy of that pathogen.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033649" "lipid droplet-associated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid droplet-associated protein", "short" "LipDrop-assoc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 310, "taxa" 1038, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 980, "sets" 0, "proteins" 980, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 811}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047728", :literature {"PUB00105219" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Daniel J" "Maamar H" "Deb C" "Sirakova TD" "Kolattukudy PE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses host triacylglycerol to accumulate lipid droplets and acquires a dormancy-like phenotype in lipid-loaded macrophages.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e1002093", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21731490}, "PUB00105220" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ding Y" "Yang L" "Zhang S" "Wang Y" "Du Y" "Pu J" "Peng G" "Chen Y" "Zhang H" "Yu J" "Hang H" "Wu P" "Yang F" "Yang H" "Steinbuchel A" "Liu P."], "ISO_journal" "J Lipid Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Lipid Res", "title" "Identification of the major functional proteins of prokaryotic lipid droplets.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "399-411", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22180631}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047728", "name" "Lipid droplet-associated protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
