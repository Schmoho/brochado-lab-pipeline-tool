{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A newly defined histidine kinase ([interpro:IPR022510]) and response regulator ([interpro:IPR022305]) gene pair occurs exclusively in Proteobacteria, mostly of marine origin, nearly all of which contain a subfamily 6 sortase ([interpro:IPR022445]) and its single dedicated target protein ([interpro:IPR022440]) adjacent to to the sortase. This protein family shows up in only in those species with the histidine kinase/response regulator gene pair, and often adjacent to that pair. It belongs to the OmpA protein family ([pfam:PF00691]). Its function is unknown. We assign the gene symbol pdsO, for Proteobacterial Dedicated Sortase system OmpA family protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036737", "name" "OmpA-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03789" "sortase-associated OmpA-like protein PdsO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteobacterial sortase system peptidoglycan-associated protein", "short" "PdsO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 86, "taxa" 396, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 349, "sets" 0, "proteins" 349, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 261}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022511", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022511", "name" "Proteobacterial sortase system peptidoglycan-associated protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
