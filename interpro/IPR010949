{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor/transporters acting on iron-containing proteins such as haemoglobin, transferrin and lactoferrin.  It contains the haem/haemoglobin receptor family and the transferrin/lactoferrin receptor family.  Nearly all of the species, which contain sequences in this family have access to haemoglobin, transferrin or lactoferrin or related proteins in their biological niche and the proteins are therefore most likely to be haemoglobin transporters.</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry includes TbpA from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. It can form the transferrin complex that acquires iron by extracting it from serum transferrin (TF) in its human host. It contains the classic fold with a 22-strand transmembrane Î²-barrel encompassing a plug domain [[cite:PUB00095094]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036942", "name" "TonB-dependent receptor-like, beta-barrel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01786" "TonB-dependent hemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TonB-dependent haemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin receptor", "short" "TonB_Hb/transfer/lactofer_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1103, "taxa" 5862, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7852, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7852, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6062}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010949", :literature {"PUB00095094" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7387", "authors" ["Noinaj N" "Easley NC" "Oke M" "Mizuno N" "Gumbart J" "Boura E" "Steere AN" "Zak O" "Aisen P" "Tajkhorshid E" "Evans RW" "Gorringe AR" "Mason AB" "Steven AC" "Buchanan SK."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structural basis for iron piracy by pathogenic Neisseria.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "53-8", "volume" "483", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22327295}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0022857", "name" "transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0055085", "name" "transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019867", "name" "outer membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039426", "name" "TonB-dependent receptor-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR010100", "name" "TonB-dependent copper receptor", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010101", "name" "TonB-dependent vitamin B12 transporter BtuB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010105", "name" "TonB-dependent siderophore receptor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR049654", "name" "Fe(3+) dicitrate transport protein FecA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR010949", "name" "TonB-dependent haemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin receptor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR010948", "name" "TonB-dependent lactoferrin/transferrin receptor", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011276", "name" "TonB-dependent haem/haemoglobin receptor", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR048212", "name" "Pyrroloquinoline quinone transporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR049843", "name" "Zinc piracy TonB-dependent receptor ZnuD", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
