{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family include proteins predominantly from bacteria but also from some archaeal and eukaryotic species.</p>\n\n<p>The Escherichia coli member of this family, YegS, has been purified and shown to have phosphatidylglycerol kinase activity [[cite:PUB00039707]]. DagK from Bacillus subtilis catalyses the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid. It is a key enzyme involved in the production of lipoteichoic acid by reintroducing DAG formed from the breakdown of membrane phospholipids into the phosphatidylglycerol biosynthetic pathway. It is more active toward long-chain DAG compared with short-chain DAG and is not able to phosphorylate substrates other than DAG, such as monoacylglycerol, ceramide, undecaprenol, phosphatidylinositol, or sphingosine [[cite:PUB00053893]].</p>\n\n<p>Sphingoid long-chain bases kinase 2, mitochondrial from Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) is involved in the production of sphingoid long-chain base (LCB). This protein is required for the cold-induced accumulation of phytosphingosine-phosphate, the regulation of the cold-responsive MPK6 and reduction of root growth at moderate low temperature [[cite:PUB00099966]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bon", "name" "Structure of an Escherichia coli lipid kinase (YegS)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016064", "name" "NAD kinase/diacylglycerol kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00147" "YegS/Rv2252/BmrU family lipid kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diacylglycerol/lipid kinase", "short" "Diacylglycerol/lipid_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4564, "taxa" 19327, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27984, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21092}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
