{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The chloroplast genomes of most higher plants contain two giant open reading frames designated ycf1 and ycf2. TIC214 is encoded by ycf1. In chloroplasts, Tic214, Tic100, Tic56, and Tic20-I form stable 1-MD TIC complexes, which were shown to associate with preproteins. TIC214 is involved in protein precursor import into chloroplasts [[cite:PUB00078899]].
