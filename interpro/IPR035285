{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes peptides isolated from Phoneutria such as delta-ctenitoxins. Members of the CNTX-Pn1a family and its paralogues (delta-CNTX-Pn1b through delta-CNTX-Pn1e) of Phoneutria toxins have complex effects on sodium channels, but their primary effect appears to be an inhibition of channel inactivation, a pharmacology similar to that of the delta-atracotoxins and delta-conotoxins. Orthologous toxins such as delta-CNTX-Pr1/PK1 and Pn2 are also family members, some of which act by blocking the calcium channels [[cite:PUB00085293]]. Delta-CNTX-Pn1a and delta-CNTX-PN2a are 48-amino-acid polypeptides, with 5 disulfide bridges [[cite:PUB00085294]]. The later has a complex pharmacology that results in inhibition of NaV channel inactivation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the channel activation potential [[cite:PUB00085295]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17492" "Delta Ctenitoxins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ctenitoxin", "short" "CNTX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 28, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035285", :literature {"PUB00085293" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["King GF" "Gentz MC" "Escoubas P" "Nicholson GM."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.05.020", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "A rational nomenclature for naming peptide toxins from spiders and other venomous animals.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "264-76", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18619481}, "PUB00085294" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Emerich BL" "Ferreira RC" "Cordeiro MN" "Borges MH" "Pimenta AM" "Figueiredo SG" "Duarte ID" "de Lima ME."], "ISO_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins8040106", "medline_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "title" "Î´-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a, a Peptide from Phoneutria nigriventer Spider Venom, Shows Antinociceptive Effect Involving Opioid and Cannabinoid Systems, in Rats.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "106", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27077886}, "PUB00085295" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Saez NJ" "Senff S" "Jensen JE" "Er SY" "Herzig V" "Rash LD" "King GF."], "ISO_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins2122851", "medline_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "title" "Spider-venom peptides as therapeutics.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "2851-71", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22069579}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035285", "name" "Ctenitoxin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
