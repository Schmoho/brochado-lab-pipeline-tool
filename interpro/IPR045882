GPT1/2 are microtubule-associated proteins that contain the basic MT-binding regions at their central and C-terminal regions, and bind directly to MTs in vitro. They track the plus ends of growing MTs independently of EB1 and SPR1 [[cite:PUB00099194]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33737" "OS05G0121800 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GROWING PLUS-END TRACKING 1/2", "short" "GPT1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 240, "taxa" 934, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1604, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1604, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 865}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045882", :literature {"PUB00099194" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wong JH" "Hashimoto T."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "title" "Novel Arabidopsis microtubule-associated proteins track growing microtubule plus ends.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "33", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28148225}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008017", "name" "microtubule binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045882", "name" "GROWING PLUS-END TRACKING 1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
