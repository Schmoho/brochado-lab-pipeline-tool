{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Beta-carotene isomerase D27 (also known as Protein DWARF-27) from plants is involved in strigolactones biosynthesis. It is a beta-carotene isomerase that converts all-trans-beta-carotene into 9-cis-beta-carotene, which is cleaved by CCD7 into a 9-cis-configured aldehyde [[cite:PUB00088582], [cite:PUB00095645]]. This is an iron-containing protein that localises in chloroplasts and is expressed mainly in vascular cells of shoots and roots [[cite:PUB00095646]].
