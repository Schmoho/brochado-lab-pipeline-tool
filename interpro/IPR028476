{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>S100A10 (also known as p11) belongs to the S100 calcium-binding family and is involved in intracellular trafficking and cell migration [[cite:PUB00068493]]. S100A10 may be involved in the promotion of cancer cell invasion and migration [[cite:PUB00068494]]. S100A10 is required for the activity of Rac1, which regulates actin dynamics and promotes cell spreading [[cite:PUB00068493]]. S100A10 forms a heterotetrameric complex with ANX2 (membrane-binding protein annexin A2), which is involved in membrane transport events such as endocytosis and exocytosis [[cite:PUB00068493]]. ANX2 can also bind and bundle actin filaments and is required for actin dynamics to promote cell migration and spreading [[cite:PUB00068495]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011992", "name" "EF-hand domain pair", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05024" "S-100A10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein S100-A10", "short" "S100-A10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 133, "taxa" 494, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 195, "sets" 0, "proteins" 195, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 139}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028476", :literature {"PUB00068493" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Sayeed S" "Asano E" "Ito S" "Ohno K" "Hamaguchi M" "Senga T."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
