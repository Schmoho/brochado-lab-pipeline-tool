{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) from archaea and plants. They catalyze the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the building block of all isoprenoids [[cite:PUB00073601], [cite:PUB00101688]]. This entry also includes FomA protein from Streptomyces. IPKs and FomA are architecturally very similar [[cite:PUB00101689]].</p>\n\n<p>Fosfomycin (L-(cis)-1,2-epoxy propyl phosphonic acid) is an antibiotic produced by some species of Streptomyces and Pseudomonas. As an analogue of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), this compound irreversibly inhibits PEP UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-3-O-enolpyruvyltransferase (enolpyruvyltransferase), which catalyses the first step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00014686]]. FomA is one of the fosfomycin resistance kinases. Together with FomB (encoded in the fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces wedmorensis), FomA confer fosfomycin resistance on Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00014686]]. FomA catalyses phosphorylation of fosfomycin to fosfomycin monophosphate, and FomB phosphorylation of fosfomycin monophosphate to fosfomycin diphosphate, in the presence of ATP and a magnesium ion [[cite:PUB00014686]]. Surprisingly, while FomA homologues are present in many organisms, including fosfomycin-producing ones, no homologues of FomB are detected to date.</p>\n\n<p>FomA and related sequences are members of the Amino Acid Kinase Superfamily (AAK).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ll5", "name" "Crystal structure of T. acidophilum isopentenyl phosphate kinase product complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036393", "name" "Acetylglutamate kinase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040647" "isopentenyl phosphate kinase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016496" "Fosfomycin resistance kinase, FomA type"}, "cdd" {"cd04241" "AAK_FomA-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fosfomycin resistance kinase, FomA-type", "short" "Fosfomycin_R_FomA-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 661, "taxa" 4132, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3945, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3939, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3128}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
