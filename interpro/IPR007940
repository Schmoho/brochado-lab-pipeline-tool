{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic SH3 domain-binding protein 5 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting proteins (SH3BP5 or Sab). Sab binds to and serves as a substrate for JNK in vitro, and has been found to interact with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk).  Inspection of the sequence of Sab reveals the presence of two putative mitogen-activated protein kinase interaction motifs (KIMs) similar to that found in the JNK docking domain of the c-Jun transcription factor, and four potential serine-proline JNK phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal half of the molecule [[cite:PUB00010453]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes REI-1 and REI-2 from C. elegans. REI-1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RAB-11. It functions in early embryos [[cite:PUB00077978]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05276" "SH3 domain-binding protein 5 (SH3BP5)"}, "panther" {"PTHR19423" "SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SH3-binding 5", "short" "SH3BP5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 60, "proteomes" 1021, "taxa" 4105, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3670, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3532, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2322}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007940", :literature {"PUB00010453" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 3", "authors" ["Wiltshire C" "Matsushita M" "Tsukada S" "Gillespie DA" "May GH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
