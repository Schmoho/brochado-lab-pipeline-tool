{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes proteins predominantly found in Gammaproteobacteria, such as YhfG from Escherichia coli. YhfG is a FicA antitoxin homologue (also known as antitoxin EcFicA) that interacts with EcFiT and forms a complex with it. YhfG shows a unique conformation, forming two parallel Î±-helices linked by a 10-residues loop. The structure of the complex shows a highly conserved extended ligand-binding pocket [[cite:PUB00100669]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5jff", "name" "E. coli EcFicT mutant G55R in complex with EcFicA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10832" "YhfG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FicA antitoxin homologue YhfG", "short" "YhfG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 113, "taxa" 1414, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1413, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1413, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1103}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022541", :literature {"PUB00100669" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Stanger FV" "Harms A" "Dehio C" "Schirmer T."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Crystal Structure of the Escherichia coli Fic Toxin-Like Protein in Complex with Its Cognate Antitoxin.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0163654", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27657533}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022541", "name" "FicA antitoxin homologue YhfG", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 109}}}
