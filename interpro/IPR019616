{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ycf54 is found encoded in the chloroplast genomes of algae, it is also found in plants and in the cyanobacteria. Ycf54 is a component of the MgPME-cyclase complex. Ycf54 plays two roles in the function of the MgPME-cyclase. First, it plays a critical role in t assembly/stability of the Mg-cyclase complex and its constituents and, secondly, is required for normal Pchlide formation. Both functions indicate that this protein is required for optimal MgPME-cyclase activity, although it is not absolutely essential [[cite:PUB00097432]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5m2p", "name" "The Structure of the Ycf54 protein from Synechocystis sp.
