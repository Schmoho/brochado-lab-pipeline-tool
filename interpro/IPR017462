In large numbers of proteobacterial species, this complex acts on a Cys-derived persulphide moiety, delivered by the cysteine desulphurase IscS to TusA, then to TusBCD. The activated sulphur group is then transferred to TusE (DsrC), then by MnmA (TrmU) for modification of an anticodon nucleotide in tRNAs for Glu, Lys, and Gln [[cite:PUB00040153]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sulphur relay complex TusBCD is also found, under the designation DsrEFH, in phototrophic and chemotrophic sulphur bacteria, such as Chromatium vinosum or Chlorobium tepidum [[cite:PUB00086971]]. In these organisms, it seems the primary purpose is related to sulphur flux, such as oxidation from sulphide to molecular sulphur to sulphate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2hy5", "name" "Crystal structure of DsrEFH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027396", "name" "DsrEFH-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38780" "PROTEIN TUSC"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03010" "sulfurtransferase complex subunit TusC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphur relay, TusC/DsrF", "short" "Sulphur_relay_TusC/DsrF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 851, "taxa" 5090, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5297, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5297, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4114}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1555", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1555"} {"accession" "GenProp0654", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0654"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017462", :literature {"PUB00040153" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Numata T" "Fukai S" "Ikeuchi Y" "Suzuki T" "Nureki O."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2005.11.009", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural basis for sulfur relay to RNA mediated by heterohexameric TusBCD complex.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "357-66", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16472754}, "PUB00086971" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bagchi A" "Ghosh TC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
