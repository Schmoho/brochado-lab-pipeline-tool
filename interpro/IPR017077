As the family is exclusively found in phototrophic organisms it may play a role in photosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036962" "Predicted signal transduction protein Ycf55"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ycf55, algae", "short" "Uncharacterised_Ycf55_algae"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 437, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 191, "sets" 0, "proteins" 191, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 179}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017077", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022552", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ycf55", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016837", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ycf55, cyanobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017077", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family Ycf55, algae", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
