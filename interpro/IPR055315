{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes cramped protein from Drosophila melanogaster and its orthologues from animals, cramped-like proteins. Cramped is involved in the regulation of gene expression patterns, particularly those governing developmental processes and segmental determination. They are associated with the Polycomb group (Pc-G) genes, which play a crucial role in maintaining the expression of homeotic selector genes. These genes are essential for proper segmental identity during development. Additionally, proteins in this family can influence chromatin structure, as they have been implicated in modifying position effect variegation (PEV), a phenomenon that affects gene silencing in certain genomic contexts [[cite:PUB00155346]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes TSL-kinase interacting protein 1 from Arabidopsis, whose function is not yet clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21677" "CRAMPED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cramped-like", "short" "Cramped-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1206, "taxa" 4804, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1743}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055315", :literature {"PUB00155346" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Yamamoto Y" "Girard F" "Bello B" "Affolter M" "Gehring WJ."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.124.17.3385", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "The cramped gene of Drosophila is a member of the Polycomb-group, and interacts with mus209, the gene encoding Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "3385-94", "volume" "124", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9310333}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003682", "name" "chromatin binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055315", "name" "Cramped-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
