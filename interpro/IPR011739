{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents gene transfer agents (GTAs), which are involved in a novel mechanism for bacterial gene transfer. They resemble small, tailed bacteriophages in ultrastructure and act like generalized transducing prophages. In contrast to functional prophages, GTAs package random fragments of bacterial genomes and incomplete copies of their own genomes. The packaged DNA content is characteristic of the GTA and ranges in size from 4.4 to 13.6kb. GTAs have been reported in species of Brachyspira, Methanococcus, Desulfovibrio, and Rhodobacter. The best studied GTAs are VSH-1 of the anaerobic, pathogenic spirochete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and RcGTA of the nonsulfur, purple, photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. VSH-1 and RcGTA have likely contributed to the ecology and evolution of these bacteria. The existence of GTAs in phylogenetically diverse bacteria suggests GTAs may be more common in nature than is now appreciated [[cite:PUB00055424]].</p>\n\n<p>In Rhodobacter capsulatus, cultures that enter the stationary phase of growth, release particles of the gene transfer agent (RcGTA). The morphology of RcGTA resembles that of a small, tailed bacteriophage, with a protein capsid surrounding a ~4 kb linear, double-stranded fragment of DNA. However, the DNA present consists of random segments of the R. capsulatus genome, which may be transferred to another strain of R. capsulatus. The recipient in RcGTA-mediated gene transduction may acquire new alleles and thus express a new phenotype. The genes encoding the structural proteins of the RcGTA are clustered on the R. capsulatus chromosome, whereas genes that encode proteins that regulate the production of RcGTA are scattered around the chromosome [[cite:PUB00055423]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry is represented by ORFg10.1 (RCAP_rcc01693) of the Gene Transfer Agent (GTA) of Rhodobacter capsulatus [see Fig.1, in [cite:PUB00055431]].
