{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of bacterial plasmid DNA replication initiator proteins. These RepA proteins exist as monomers and dimers in equilibrium: monomers bind directly to repeated DNA sequences and thus activate replication; dimers repress repA transcription by binding an inversely repeated DNA operator. Dimer dissociation can occur spontaneously or may be mediated by Hsp70 chaperones. A similar RepA family of proteins found mainly in Escherichia coli is involved in plasmid replication (see [interpro:IPR000525]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03090" "Replicase family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasmid replicase, bacterial", "short" "Plasmid_replicase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 126, "taxa" 1588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1851, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1851, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1477}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004322", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004322", "name" "Plasmid replicase, bacterial", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 134}}}
