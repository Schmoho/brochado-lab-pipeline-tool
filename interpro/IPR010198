{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents an enzyme, naphthoate synthase [ec:4.1.3.36], MenB or dihydroxynaphthoic acid synthetase, which is involved in the fifth step of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway. Menaquinone (vitamin K2), is an essential quinone used in electron-transfer pathways serving as the major electron carrier during anaerobic growth. In the bacterium, the biosynthetic pathway in bacteria typically comprises 6-7 steps [[cite:PUB00013809]]. Together with o-succinylbenzoate-CoA ligase (menE [interpro:IPR010192]), MenB takes 2-succinylbenzoate and converts it into 1,4-di-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) [[cite:PUB00013809], [cite:PUB00030125], [cite:PUB00033363], [cite:PUB00033364]]. The conversion of o-succinylbenzoate-CoA ligase to DHNA is mediated by the enzyme DHNA synthase, which is encoded by menB [[cite:PUB00033365]].</p>\n\n<p>The protein structure of naphthoate synthase has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallised, and found to have fold characteristics of the crotonase family of enzymes, which is notable for the presence of several highly flexible regions around the active site. The C-terminal region of the protein may play a critical role both in completion of the binding pocket and in stabilisation of the hexamer, suggesting a link between oligomerisation and catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00033366]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4i4z", "name" "Synechocystis sp.
