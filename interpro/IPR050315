{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The FAD-dependent oxidoreductase 2 family is characterised by its members' ability to catalyse various redox reactions, often involving the reduction of electron acceptors using FAD as a cofactor. Members of this family are involved in diverse biological processes, including the anaerobic conversion of glycerol 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone, steroid degradation, and the reduction of unsaturated compounds such as urocanate, acrylate, and fumarate. These enzymes play crucial roles in metabolic pathways across different organisms, contributing to energy conservation, detoxification, and the biosynthesis of important compounds.</p>\n\n<p>This family includes the anaerobic G-3-P dehydrogenase subunit B (GlpB), 3-oxosteroid dehydrogenase, urocanate reductase and FRD/SDH among others, each with specific substrates and functions, reflecting the versatility and adaptability of these enzymes to various environmental and physiological conditions. Urocanate reductase (UrdA) catalyses the two-electron reduction of urocanate to dihydrourocanate, which is present at higher concentrations in subjects with type 2 diabetes, and directly impairs glucose tolerance and insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) through activation of p38 gamma (MAPK12)-p62-mTORC1. UrdA from the gut bacteria S.parasanguinis may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by producing the microbial metabolite dihydrourocanate [[cite:PUB00154509]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5zyn", "name" "Fumarate reductase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43400" "FUMARATE REDUCTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAD-dependent oxidoreductase 2", "short" "FAD-oxidoreductase_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 39, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4211, "taxa" 16116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38531, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38531, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29147}, "pathways" 178}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
