{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily comprises more than 20 type-I transmembrane proteins. Family members are defined based on similarity in their extracellular domain -a region that contains many cysteine residues arranged in a specific repetitive pattern [[cite:PUB00046030]]. The cysteines allow formation of an extended rod-like structure, responsible for ligand binding [[cite:PUB00000892]].</p>\n\n<p>Upon receptor activation, different intracellular signalling complexes are assembled for different members of the TNFR superfamily, depending on their intracellular domains and sequences [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Activation of TNFRs can therefore induce a range of disparate effects, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, or apoptotic cell death, depending upon the receptor involved [[cite:PUB00046032], [cite:PUB00046033]].</p>\n\n<p>TNFRs are widely distributed and play important roles in many crucial biological processes, such as lymphoid and neuronal development, innate and adaptive immunity, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis [[cite:PUB00046031]]. Drugs that manipulate their signalling have potential roles in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, such as viral infections, coronary heart disease, transplant rejection, and immune disease [[cite:PUB00046034]].</p>\n\n<p>TNF receptor 13B (also known as transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI)) functions as a receptor for B-cell activating factor (BAFF) [[cite:PUB00033576]]. Mutations in TNF receptor 13B cause common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and IgA deficiency [[cite:PUB00053598]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1xu1", "name" "The crystal structure of APRIL bound to TACI"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15511" "TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY MEMBER 13B"}, "prints" {"PR01963" "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 13B"}, "cdd" {"cd13415" "Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (TNFRSF13B), also known as transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tumour necrosis factor receptor 13B", "short" "TNFR_13B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 556, "taxa" 1904, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 816, "sets" 0, "proteins" 796, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 561}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022317", :literature {"PUB00046030" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Armitage RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
