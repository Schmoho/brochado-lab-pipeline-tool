{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PCNP is a PEST-containing nuclear protein that is ubiquitinated by NIRF, a Np95/ICBP90-like RING finger protein probably involved in cell cycle regulation [[cite:PUB00070249]]. PEST sequences, which are rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S) and threonine (T), are found in a number of short-lived proteins, such as transcription factors and cell cycle-associated proteins. Their function is generally controlled by proteolysis, mostly via ubiquitin-mediated degradation [[cite:PUB00069841]]. NIRF and PCNP may constitute a novel signaling pathway with some relation to cell proliferation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16523" "PEST PROTEOLYTIC SIGNAL-CONTAINING NUCLEAR PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF15473" "PEST, proteolytic signal-containing nuclear protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PEST proteolytic signal-containing nuclear protein", "short" "PCNP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 862, "taxa" 3440, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1545, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1073}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029169", :literature {"PUB00069841" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Mori T" "Li Y" "Hata H" "Kochi H."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01495-9", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "NIRF is a ubiquitin ligase that is capable of ubiquitinating PCNP, a PEST-containing nuclear protein.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "209-14", "volume" "557", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14741369}, "PUB00070249" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Mori T" "Li Y" "Hata H" "Ono K" "Kochi H."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
