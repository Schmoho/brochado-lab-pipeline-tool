{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Wings apart-like protein (WAPL) regulates heterochromatin structure [[cite:PUB00016495]]. It is required to hold sister chromatids of meiotic heterochromatin together and is implicated in both heterochromatin pairing during female meiosis and the modulation of position-effect variegation (PEV) [[cite:PUB00016495]]. hWAPL ([swissprot:Q7Z5K2]), the human homologue, is found to play a role in the development of cervical carcinogenesis, and is thought to have similar functions to Drosophila wapl protein [[cite:PUB00016544]]. Malfunction of the hWAPL pathway is thought to activate an apoptotic pathway that consequently leads to cell death [[cite:PUB00016544]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22100" "WINGS APART-LIKE PROTEIN HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Wings apart-like protein", "short" "WAPL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2074, "taxa" 7263, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4819, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4819, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2820}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039874", :literature {"PUB00016544" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Oikawa K" "Ohbayashi T" "Kiyono T" "Nishi H" "Isaka K" "Umezawa A" "Kuroda M" "Mukai K."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3822", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "Expression of a novel human gene, human wings apart-like (hWAPL), is associated with cervical carcinogenesis and tumor progression.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "3545-9", "volume" "64", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15150110}, "PUB00016495" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Verni F" "Gandhi R" "Goldberg ML" "Gatti M."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=10747063&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Genetic and molecular analysis of wings apart-like (wapl), a gene controlling heterochromatin organization in Drosophila melanogaster.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "1693-710", "volume" "154", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10747063}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039874", "name" "Wings apart-like protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
