Its pattern of action has been shown to be complex, upregulating certain extracellular toxins and enzymes expressed post-exponentially and repressing some exponential-phase surface components. AgrD encodes the precursor of the autoinducing peptide (AIP).The AIP derived from AgrD by the action of AgrB interacts with AgrC in the membrane to activate AgrA, which upregulates transcription both from promoter P2, amplifying the response, and from P3, initiating the production of a novel effector: RNAIII. In S. aureus, delta-hemolysin is the only translation product of RNA III and is not involved in the regulatory functions of the transcript, which is therefore the primary agent for modulating the expression of other operons controlled by agr [[cite:PUB00011918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04223" "AgrD family cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide"}, "pfam" {"PF05931" "Staphylococcal AgrD protein"}, "smart" {"SM00794" "Staphylococcal AgrD protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AgrD, cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide", "short" "AgrD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 442, "taxa" 1789, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2555, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2555, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2052}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1011", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1011"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009229", :literature {"PUB00011918" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Dufour P" "Jarraud S" "Vandenesch F" "Greenland T" "Novick RP" "Bes M" "Etienne J" "Lina G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
