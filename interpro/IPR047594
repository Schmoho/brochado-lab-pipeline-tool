{:metadata {:description [{"text" "This entry represents molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis C (MoaC) proteins from bacteria and eukaryotes. Members of this family are involved in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis, an essential cofactor of a diverse group of redox enzymes. MoaC is a small hexameric protein that converts, together with MoaA, a guanosine derivative to the precursor Z by inserting the carbon-8 of the purine between the 2' and 3' ribose carbon atoms, which is the first of three phases of Moco biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00080905], [cite:PUB00080906]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3jqk", "name" "Crystal structure of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein C (TTHA1789) from Thermus Theromophilus HB8 (H32 FORM)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036522", "name" "Molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis C (MoaC) domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01420" "MoaC_PE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01224_B" "Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase [moaC]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis C, bacteria/eukaryotes", "short" "MoaC_bact/euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8261, "taxa" 30716, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 29739, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29739, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22445}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
