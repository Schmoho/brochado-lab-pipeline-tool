{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N(4)-acetylcytidine amidohydrolase catalyses the hydrolysis of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C). It contains the human activating signal cointegrator homology (ASCH) domain with unknown function, although this domain has been suggested to be responsible for RNA binding during transcription activation, RNA processing and regulation of translation [[cite:PUB00044668]]. This entry includes Escherichia coli protein YqfB, which is an amidohydrolase responsible for the catabolism of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) as well as other structurally different N4-acylated cytosines/cytidines. YqfB  contains a unique Thr-Lys-Glu catalytic triad, and Arg acting as an oxyanion hole [[cite:PUB00094246]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015947", "name" "PUA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00684" "N(4)-acetylcytidine amidohydrolase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029143" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP029143 type"}, "panther" {"PTHR38088" "UCP029143 FAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N(4)-acetylcytidine amidohydrolase", "short" "AC4CH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 178, "taxa" 1531, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1691, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1691, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1323}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
