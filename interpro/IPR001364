{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haemagglutinin (HA) is one of two main surface fusion glycoproteins embedded in the envelope of influenza viruses, the other being neuraminidase (NA). There are sixteen known HA subtypes (H1-H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9), which together are used to classify influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). The antigenic variations in HA and NA enable the virus to evade host antibodies made to previous influenza strains, accounting for recurrent influenza epidemics [[cite:PUB00033165]]. The HA glycoprotein is present in the viral membrane as a single polypeptide (HA0), which must be cleaved by the host's trypsin-like proteases to produce two peptides (HA1 and HA2) in order for the virus to be infectious. Once HA0 is cleaved, the newly exposed N-terminal of the HA2 peptide then acts to fuse the viral envelope to the cellular membrane of the host cell, which allows the viral negative-stranded RNA to infect the host cell. The type of host protease can influence the infectivity and pathogenicity of the virus.</p>\r\n<p>The haemagglutinin glycoprotein is a trimer containing three structurally distinct regions: a globular head consisting of anti-parallel β-sheets that form a β-sandwich with a jelly-roll fold (contains the receptor binding site and the HA1/HA2 cleavage site); a triple-stranded, coiled-coil, α-helical stalk; and a globular foot composed of anti-parallel β-sheets [[cite:PUB00033162], [cite:PUB00033164]]. Each monomer consists of an intact HA0 polypeptide with the HA1 and HA2 regions linked by disulphide bonds. The N terminus of HA1 provides the central strand in the 5-stranded globular foot, while the rest of the HA1 chain makes its way to the 8-stranded globular head.  HA2 provides two α helices, which form part of the triple-stranded coiled-coil that stabilises the trimer, its C terminus providing the remaining strands of the 5-stranded globular foot.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the entire haemagglutinin protein (HA0) consisting of both the HA1 and HA2 regions, as found in influenza A and B viruses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6z2t", "name" "Three-dimensional structure of an influenza hemagglutinin LAH protein in its post-fusion conformation"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013828", "name" "Haemagglutinin, HA1 chain, alpha/beta domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008980", "name" "Viral capsid/haemagglutinin protein", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00509" "Haemagglutinin"}, "hamap" {"MF_04072" "Hemagglutinin [HA]"}, "prints" {"PR00329" "HEMAGGLUTN12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haemagglutinin, influenzavirus A/B", "short" "Hemagglutn_influenz_A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 712, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 119804, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 155707, "sets" 0, "proteins" 155680, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1012", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1012"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
