{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ([ec:1.2.99.5]) is found in methanogenic and sulphate-reducing archaea. The enzyme contains molybdenum or tungsten, a molybdopterin guanine dinuceotide cofactor (MGD) and iron-sulphur clusters [[cite:PUB00008259]]. It catalyses the reversible reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>and methanofuran via N-carboxymethanofuran (carbamate) to N-formylmethanofuran, the first and second steps in methanogenesis from CO<sub>2</sub>[[cite:PUB00015859], [cite:PUB00042893]]. This reaction is important for the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>to methane, in autotrophic CO<sub>2</sub>fixation, and in CO<sub>2</sub>formation from reduced C<sub>1</sub>units [[cite:PUB00016174]]. The synthesis of formylmethanofuran is crucial for the energy metabolism of archaea. Methanogenic archaea derives the energy for autrophic growth from the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>with molecular hydrogen as the electron donor [[cite:PUB00042895]]. The process of methanogenesis consists of a series of reduction reactions at which the one-carbon unit derived from CO<sub>2</sub>is bound to C<sub>1</sub>carriers.</p>\r\n<p>There are two isoenzymes of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase: a tungsten-containing isoenzyme (Fwd) and a molybdenum-containing isoenzyme (Fmd). The tungsten isoenzyme is constitutively transcribed, whereas transcription of the molybdenum operon is induced by molybdate [[cite:PUB00000170]]. The archaean Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum contains a 4-subunit (FwdA, FwdB, FwdC, FwdD) tungsten formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase and a 3-subunit (FmdA, FmdB, FmdC) molybdenum formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00016174]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit A (FmdA and FwdA) of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases.

Some organisms also encode a fusion of the C and D subunits([interpro:IPR012048]). Members of this entry share sequence similarity with the two highly conserved regions of dihydroorotase ([pirsf:PIRSF001238]) (an amidohydrolase): the first is located at the N-terminal end and contains two histidine residues suggested to be involved in binding a zinc ion [[cite:PUB00001777]]; the second conserved region is at the C terminus [[cite:PUB00007126]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Methylobacterium extorquens, homologues of FmdA, FmdB and FmdC subunits were found and shown to copurify with a functional formyltransferase complex.
