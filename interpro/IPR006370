{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family show a broad specificity for prenyl diphosphates, accepting substrates of different chain lengths. Genes coding for these enzymes have been identified in many organisms, and are mostly responsible for ubiquinone (UQ) biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00074584], [cite:PUB00074585], [cite:PUB00074586]]. 4-hydroxybenzoate solanesyltransferase from cyanobacteria displays a broad specificity with regard to the prenyl donor substrate and uses not only solanesyl diphosphate, but also a number of shorter-chain prenyl diphosphates [[cite:PUB00074587]]. One exception is LePGT1 (Lithospermum erythrorhizon 4-hydroxybenzoic acid geranyltransferase), which only accepts GPP (geranyl diphosphate) and is involved in the biosynthesis of a red naphthoquinone, shikonin, a plant secondary metabolite [[cite:PUB00074588]]. LePGT1 was reported to be the key regulatory enzyme of shikonin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00074583]] and is not relevant to the formation of UQ [[cite:PUB00074582]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044878", "name" "UbiA prenyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01635" "4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase [ubiA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01474" "4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase-like", "short" "HB_polyprenyltransferase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5644, "taxa" 21408, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18473, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18470, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13681}, "pathways" 67}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"} {"accession" "GenProp1744", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1744"} {"accession" "GenProp1585", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1585"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
