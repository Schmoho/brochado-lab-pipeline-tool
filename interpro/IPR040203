{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Sld2 from budding yeasts and Drc1 from fission yeasts. Sld2 is required for the initiation of DNA replication. Its association with DNA is required for the assembly of the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) replicative helicase complex in S phase [[cite:PUB00091067]]. Sld2 can be regulated by S-Cdk-dependent phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00090699]]. Similarly, Drc1 is regulated by Cdk phosphorylation and is required for DNA replication [[cite:PUB00053358]]. Drc1 interacts with Cut5 and plays a role in the loading of Cut5 onto origins of replication [[cite:PUB00091068]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28124" "DNA REPLICATION REGULATOR SLD2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA replication regulator Sld2", "short" "Sld2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 965, "taxa" 2652, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1419, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1419, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 904}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040203", :literature {"PUB00091067" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bruck I" "Kaplan DL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
