A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in Homo sapiens (Human). The nomenclature system uses the first three letters of the genus, followed by the first letter of the species name, followed by a number (additional letters can be added to the name as required to discriminate between similar designations).</p>\n<p>Fel d 1 is allergen 1 from Felis silvestris catus (Cat) which is an important agent in human allergic reactions [[cite:PUB00042589]]. The protein is expressed in saliva and sebaceous glands. The complete primary structure of Fel d 1 has been determined [[cite:PUB00035399]]. The allergen is tetrameric glycoprotein consisting of two disulphide-linked heterodimers of chains 1 and 2, which have been shown to be encoded by different genes. Fel d 1 chains 1 and 2 share structural similarity with uteroglobin, a secretoglobin superfamily member; chain 2 is a glycoprotein with N-linked oligosaccharides.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>SCGB1B is an androgen-binding protein that plays a role in mate selection in mice [[cite:PUB00069601]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035960", "name" "Secretoglobin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR053723", "name" "Secretoglobin Domain-Containing", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21226" "ABPA10-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR00827" "FELALLERGEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major allergen I polypeptide chain 1", "short" "CH1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 292, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 310, "sets" 0, "proteins" 307, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 219}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006178", :literature {"PUB00042589" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kaiser L" "Velickovic TC" "Badia-Martinez D" "Adedoyin J" "Thunberg S" "Hallen D" "Berndt K" "Gronlund H" "Gafvelin G" "van Hage M" "Achour A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
