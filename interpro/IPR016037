This reaction is part of the shikimate pathway which is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. DHQS consists of an N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain and a C-terminal Î±-helical domain. The active site is located in a cleft between the two domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ujn", "name" "Crystal structure of dehydroquinate synthase from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00110" "3-dehydroquinate synthase [aroB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01357" "3-dehydroquinate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-dehydroquinate synthase AroB", "short" "DHQ_synth_AroB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9973, "taxa" 36382, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38795, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28312}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0001", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0001"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
