{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family are DNA- and/or RNA-binding proteins involved in several nuclear processes such as pre-mRNA splicing, apoptosis and transcription regulation [[cite:PUB00082878], [cite:PUB00096635]], containing three RNA recognition motifs [[cite:PUB00009653], [cite:PUB00009654], [cite:PUB00009655]]. In the case of PUF60, in complex with p54, and in the presence of U2AF, it facilitates association of U2 snRNP with pre-mRNA [[cite:PUB00009654]]. Poly(U)-binding-splicing factor rnp-6 from C.elegans is an homologue of mammalian PUF60 and it ensures the correct splicing of genes involved in immunity to promote longevity in response to infection by pathogenic bacteria such as S.aureus [[cite:PUB00096635]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01645" "poly-U binding splicing factor, half-pint family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poly-U binding splicing factor, PUF60-like", "short" "PUF60-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 635, "taxa" 2914, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2573, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2573, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1487}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006532", :literature {"PUB00009653" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Van Buskirk C" "Schupbach T."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
