{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic eIF-5A was initially thought to function as a translation initiation factor, based on its ability to stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis. However, subsequent work revealed a role for eIF5A in translation elongation [[cite:PUB00046010], [cite:PUB00090482]]. Depletion or inactivation of eIF-5A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) resulted in the accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times. Addition of recombinant eIF-5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover, inactivation of eIF-5A mimicked the effects of the eEF2 inhibitor sordarin, indicating that eIF-5A might function together with eEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Finally, it was shown that eIF5A is specifically required to promote peptide-bond formation between consecutive proline residues. It has been proposed to stimulate the peptidyl-transferase activity of the ribosome and facilitate the reactivity of poor substrates like proline [[cite:PUB00082267]].</p>\n\n<p>eIF-5A is a cofactor for the Rev and Rex transactivator proteins of human immunodeficiency virus-1 and T-cell leukaemia virus I, respectively [[cite:PUB00000742], [cite:PUB00003672], [cite:PUB00010716]]. IF-5A is the sole protein in eukaryotes and archaea to contain the unusual amino acid hypusine (Ne-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) that is an absolute functional requirement. The first step in the post-translational modification of lysine to hypusine is catalyzed by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase, the structure of which has been reported [[cite:PUB00005808]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family also includes the Woronin body major protein Hex1, whose sequence and structure are similar to eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), suggesting they share a common ancestor during evolution [[cite:PUB00026734]].
