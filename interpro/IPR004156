{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs). Several have been identified mostly in human and rat. Different OATPs vary in tissue distribution and substrate specificity. Since the numbering of different OATPs in particular species was based originally on the order of discovery, similarly numbered OATPs in humans and rats did not necessarily correspond in function, tissue distribution and substrate specificity (in spite of the name, some OATPs also transport organic cations and neutral molecules) so a scheme of using digits for rat OATPs and letters for human ones was introduced [[cite:PUB00007397]]. Prostaglandin transporter (PGT) proteins are also considered to be OATP family members. In addition, the methotrexate transporter OATK is closely related to OATPs. This family also includes several predicted proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. This similarity was not previously noted. All characterized OATPs are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains and are sodium-independent transport systems [[cite:PUB00087218]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03137" "Organic Anion Transporter Polypeptide (OATP) family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00805" "OAT family organic anion transporter"}, "panther" {"PTHR11388" "ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Organic anion transporter polypeptide", "short" "OATP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 166, "proteomes" 1110, "taxa" 4713, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19838, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17926, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11532}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004156", :literature {"PUB00007397" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tamai I" "Nezu J" "Uchino H" "Sai Y" "Oku A" "Shimane M" "Tsuji A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
