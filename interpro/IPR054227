{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of uncharacterised proteins found in archaea and bacteria. These proteins are predicted to adopt similar structure to the members of SufE/NifU superfamily. They contain three invariant cysteine residues and a fourth semi-conserved residue either cysteine or histidine. These residues are likely to define a potential Zn-binding site similar to the binding site observed in SufU.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22263" "Family of unknown function (DUF6951)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6951", "short" "DUF6951"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 103, "taxa" 891, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 959, "sets" 0, "proteins" 955, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 797}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054227", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054227", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6951", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 110, "alignment:full" 161}}}
