{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Arfaptin-1, Arfaptin-2, and protein kinase C-binding protein 1 (PICK1). They all contain a Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain [[cite:PUB00014978]]. BAR-domain-containing proteins are key players in membrane dynamics as their crescent shape allows them to sense or generate curvature on lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00074028]].</p>\r\n<p>Arfaptin-1 and 2 have been shown to interact with Arf GTPases and Arf-like 1 (Arl1). They are recruited to trans-Golgi membranes through interaction with Arl1 [[cite:PUB00074234]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In neurons, PICK1 forms homodimers and serves as one of the scaffolding proteins that interacts with AMPA receptors and regulates their trafficking in synaptic plasticity [[cite:PUB00074233]]. In pancreatic beta cells, it forms heteromeric BAR-domain complexes with another cytosolic lipid-binding protein, ICA69. Together they are key regulators of the formation and maturation of insulin granules [[cite:PUB00074022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ar4", "name" "Crystal structure of PICK1 in complex with the small molecule inhibitor 1o"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027267", "name" "AH/BAR domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12141" "ARFAPTIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arfaptin family", "short" "Arfaptin_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1037, "taxa" 4168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6348, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6348, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4113}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030798", :literature {"PUB00074233" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Shao X" "Zhu L" "Wang Y" "Lu Y" "Wang W" "Zhu J" "Shen Y" "Xia J" "Luo J."], "ISO_journal" "Neurochem.
