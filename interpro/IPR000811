{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases. These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([ec:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [[cite:PUB00009409]]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Glycosyltransferase family 35 [cazy:GT35]\r\ncomprises enzymes with only one known activity; glycogen and starch phosphorylase ([ec:2.4.1.1]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1l5w", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Maltodextrin Phosphorylase Complexed with the Products of the Enzymatic Reaction between Glucose-1-phosphate and Maltotetraose"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00343" "Carbohydrate phosphorylase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11468" "GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000460" "Glucan phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyl transferase, family 35", "short" "Glyco_trans_35"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 278, "domain_architectures" 180, "proteomes" 8260, "taxa" 34765, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50079, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48367, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33962}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GT35", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GT35.html"}]}, "prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00095", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00095"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1259", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1259"} {"accession" "GenProp1412", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1412"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
