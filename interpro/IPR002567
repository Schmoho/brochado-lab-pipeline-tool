{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) (Human herpes simplex virus 1) glycoprotein K (gK) plays an essential role in viral replication and cell fusion. gK is a very hydrophobic membrane protein that contains a signal sequence and several hydrophobic regions. gK contains three transmembrane domains (amino acids 125-139, 226-239, and 311-325) and another hydrophobic domain (amino acids 241-265), which is relatively less hydrophobic and much longer compared with the transmembrane sequences located in the extracellular loop. The domains may interact with each other to form a complex tertiary structure that is critical for the biological function of gK [[cite:PUB00006395]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01621" "Cell fusion glycoprotein K"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Envelope glycoprotein K", "short" "GK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 213, "sets" 0, "proteins" 213, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002567", :literature {"PUB00006395" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Mo C" "Holland TC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
