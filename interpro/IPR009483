{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several invasion plasmid antigen IpaD proteins found in Shigella [[cite:PUB00019750]] as well as homologues such as SipD from Salmonella [[cite:PUB00106891]] and BipD from Burkholderia [[cite:PUB00065649]]. Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion systems (T3SSs) as protein transport devices for injecting virulence effector proteins into eukaryotic cells during infection. T3SSs consist of a needle complex (NC) and a tip complex (TC). In Shigella the TC is composed of two proteins, each essential to host cell sensing: IpaD and IpaB. IpaD is hydrophilic and required for tip recruitment of the hydrophobic proteins IpaB and IpaC, which later form the pore in host cell membranes [[cite:PUB00091058]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3r9v", "name" "Cocrystal Structure of Proteolytically Truncated Form of IpaD from Shigella flexneri Bound to Deoxycholate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036708", "name" "BipD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06511" "Type III secretion systems tip complex components"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02553" "type III secretion system needle tip protein SctA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion systems tip complex component IpaD/BipD/SipD", "short" "IpaD/BipD/SipD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 58, "taxa" 656, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1006, "sets" 0, "proteins" 979, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 834}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009483", :literature {"PUB00091058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cheung M" "Shen DK" "Makino F" "Kato T" "Roehrich AD" "Martinez-Argudo I" "Walker ML" "Murillo I" "Liu X" "Pain M" "Brown J" "Frazer G" "Mantell J" "Mina P" "Todd T" "Sessions RB" "Namba K" "Blocker AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
