The Par-3/Par-6/aPKC/Cdc42 complex regulates the conversion of primordial adherens junctions (AJs) into belt-like AJs and the formation of linear actin cables. When primordial AJs are formed, Par-3 recruits scaffolding protein FRMD4A which connects Par-3 and the Arf6 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), cytohesin-1 [[cite:PUB00092508]].</p>\n\n<p>FERM domain-containing protein 4B (FRMD4B, also called GRP1-binding protein, GRSP1) is a novel member of GRP1 signalling complexes that are recruited to plasma membrane ruffles in response to insulin receptor signalling. The GRSP1/FRMD4B protein contains a FERM protein domain as well as two coiled coil domains and may function as a scaffolding protein. GRP1 and GRSP1 interact through the coiled coil domains in the two proteins [[cite:PUB00091835]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46079" "FERM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FERM domain-containing protein 4A/B", "short" "FRMD4A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 917, "taxa" 3538, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4795, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3036}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047176", :literature {"PUB00091835" {"URL" nil, "issue" "43", "authors" ["Klarlund JK" "Holik J" "Chawla A" "Park JG" "Buxton J" "Czech MP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
