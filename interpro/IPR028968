A key feature that distinguishes the polymorphic toxins from conventional toxins (whose primary targets are in distantly related organisms) is the presence of immunity proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15581" "Immunity protein 58"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunity protein 58", "short" "Imm58"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 73, "sets" 0, "proteins" 73, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 58}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028968", :literature {"PUB00066726" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhang D" "de Souza RF" "Anantharaman V" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
