{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents RimI, a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) also known as [Ribosomal protein bS18]-alanine N-acetyltransferase which catalyses the acetylation of the N-terminal alanine of ribosomal protein bS18 [[cite:PUB00047206]]. RimI can also acetylate an N-epsilon-lysine on different proteins which constitutes one of the most abundant and important post-translational modifications. This suggests that RimI has N-alpha-amino acid and N-epsilon-lysine acetylation activity, but the substrate specificity of this enzyme is still unclear [[cite:PUB00094463]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5isv", "name" "Crystal structure of the ribosomal-protein-S18-alanine N-acetyltransferase from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02210" "[Ribosomal protein bS18]-alanine N-acetyltransferase [rimI]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetyltransferase RimI", "short" "RimI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1352, "taxa" 6610, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7275, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7275, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5596}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
