{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains Escherichia coli YbhB and YbcL, two bacterial homologues to Raf kinase inhibitor proteins from mammals (RKIP, previously known as PEBP), according to structural similarity. YbhB and YbcL have specific features, for example a substrate binding pocket formed by the dimerization interface and the absence of cis peptide bonds which could correspond to the recognition of multiple cellular partners [[cite:PUB00015041]]. YbcL encoded by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) acts on the uroepithelium and attenuates neutrophil migration during infection [[cite:PUB00106497]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includs LppC from M. tuberculosis, which is likely involved in bacterial recognition and uptake by its host [[cite:PUB00135086]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fjj", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF E.COLI YBHB PROTEIN, A NEW MEMBER OF THE MAMMALIAN PEBP FAMILY"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036610", "name" "PEBP-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00865" "PhosphatidylEthanolamine-Binding Protein (PEBP) domain present in bacteria and archaea"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00481" "YbhB/YbcL family Raf kinase inhibitor-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YbhB/YbcL/LppC-like", "short" "YbhB_YbcL/LppC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4509, "taxa" 19471, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24964, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19524}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005247", :literature {"PUB00135086" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ocampo M" "Curtidor H" "Vanegas M" "Patarroyo MA" "Patarroyo ME."], "ISO_journal" "Chem Biol Drug Des", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Chem Biol Drug Des", "title" "Specific interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoprotein-derived peptides and target cells inhibits mycobacterial entry in vitro.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "626-41", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25041568}, "PUB00015041" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Serre L" "Pereira de Jesus K" "Zelwer C" "Bureaud N" "Schoentgen F" "Benedetti H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
