{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme is proposed here to be a form of aspartate 1-decarboxylase, pyridoxal-dependent, that represents a non-orthologous displacement to the more widely distributed pyruvoyl-dependent form ([ncbifam:TIGR00223]). Aspartate 1-decarboxylase makes beta-alanine, used usually in pathothenate biosynthesis, by decarboxylation from asparatate. A number of species with the PanB and PanC enzymes, however, lack PanD. This protein family occurs in a number of Proteobacteria that lack PanD. This enzyme family appears to be a pyridoxal-dependent enzyme (see [pfam:PF00282]). The family was identified by Partial Phylogenetic Profiling; members in Geobacter sulfurreducens, Geobacter metallireducens, and Pseudoalteromonas atlantica are clustered with the genes for PanB and PanC. We suggest the gene symbol panP (panthothenate biosynthesis enzyme, Pyridoxal-dependent).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03799" "pyridoxal-dependent aspartate 1-decarboxylase PanP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartate 1-decarboxylase, pyridoxal-dependent", "short" "Asp_decarboxylase_pyridox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 285, "taxa" 1376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1204, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1204, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 938}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0124", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0124"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
