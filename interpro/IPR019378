{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of conserved proteins representing the enzyme responsible for adding O-fucose to EGF (epidermal growth factor-like) repeats. Six highly conserved cysteines are present as well as a DXD-like motif (ERD), conserved in mammals, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Both features are characteristic of several glycosyltransferase families. The enzyme is a membrane-bound protein released by proteolysis and, as for most glycosyltransferases, is strongly activated by manganese [[cite:PUB00044411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5kxq", "name" "mouse POFUT1 in complex with GDP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10250" "GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase", "short" "GDP-Fuc_O-FucTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 432, "proteomes" 1872, "taxa" 7149, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26325, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25793, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15785}, "pathways" 204}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
