{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>FtsY is involved in targeting and insertion of nascent membrane proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane. It acts as a receptor for the complex formed by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the ribosome-nascent chain (RNC). In E. coli, interaction with SRP-RNC leads to the transfer of the RNC complex to the Sec translocase for insertion into the membrane, the hydrolysis of GTP by both Ffh and FtsY, and the dissociation of the SRP-FtsY complex into the individual components [[cite:PUB00017615], [cite:PUB00060300], [cite:PUB00060301]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2j7p", "name" "GMPPNP-stabilized NG domain complex of the SRP GTPases Ffh and FtsY"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00920" "Signal recognition particle receptor FtsY [ftsY]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00064" "signal recognition particle-docking protein FtsY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Signal-recognition particle receptor FtsY", "short" "SR_rcpt_FtsY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 44, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9586, "taxa" 36966, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42338, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42338, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32349}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
