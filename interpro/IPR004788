{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, also known as phosphoriboisomerase, catalyses the reversible conversion of D-ribose 5-phosphate to D-ribulose 5-phosphate, the first step in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway [[cite:PUB00028856]]. This reaction enables ribose to be synthesized from sugars, as well as the recycling of sugars during the degradation of nucleotides. There are two unrelated types of ribose 5-phosphate isomerases: type A (RpiA) is the most common and is found in most organisms, while type B (RpiB) is restricted to specific eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. Escherichia coli produces both RpiA and RpiB (also known as AlsB), although RpiA accounts for 99% of total RPI enzymes [[cite:PUB00020248]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents type A (RpiA) enzymes found in eukaryotes (plants, Metazoa and fungi), bacteria and archaea.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1o8b", "name" "Structure of Escherichia coli ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, RpiA, complexed with arabinose-5-phosphate."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037171", "name" "NagB/RpiA transferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01398" "RPI_A"}, "pfam" {"PF06026" "Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A (phosphoriboisomerase A)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00021" "ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A"}, "panther" {"PTHR11934" "RIBOSE-5-PHOSPHATE ISOMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase, type A", "short" "Ribose5P_isomerase_type_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 125, "proteomes" 7114, "taxa" 28504, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28748, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28696, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21636}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"} {"accession" "GenProp1438", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1438"} {"accession" "GenProp1294", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1294"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
