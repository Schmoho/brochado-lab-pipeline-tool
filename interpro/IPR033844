{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human asparaginase-like protein 1 (ASRGL1) [[cite:PUB00081805]] and similar proteins constitute a subfamily of the L-Asparaginase type 2-like enzymes. The wider family includes Glycosylasparaginase, Taspase 1, and  L-Asparaginase type 2 enzymes. The proenzymes undergo autoproteolytic cleavage before a threonine to generate alpha and beta subunits. The threonine becomes the N-terminal residue of the beta subunit and is the catalytic residue [[cite:PUB00067200], [cite:PUB00065252]]. Because of this autolytic cleavage, the ASRGL1 precursor is considered a peptidase (MEROPS identifier T02.002).  ASRGL1, or asparaginase-like 1, has been cloned from mammalian testis cDNA libraries. It has been identified as a sperm antigen that may induce the production of autoantibodies following obstruction of the male reproductive tract, e.g. vasectomy [[cite:PUB00081386]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4o0c", "name" "High resolution crystal structure of uncleaved human L-asparaginase protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029055", "name" "Nucleophile aminohydrolases, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04702" "Metazoan L-Asparaginase type 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Asparaginase-like 1, metazoa", "short" "ASRGL1_meta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 836, "taxa" 3667, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2014, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2006, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1356}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
