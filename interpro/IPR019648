{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family, formerly known as DUF2511, includes Protein YebY from Escherichia coli and similar proteins predominantly found in Gammaproteobacteria.  Together with YebA, encoded by the same operon, YebY is required for the activity of the copper-related NADH dehydrogenase II (NDH-2). The crystal structure of  YebY shows great similarity to that of the lantibiotic self-resistance protein MlbQ, which has a hydrophobic surface patch [[cite:PUB00100157], [cite:PUB00100158]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7n0j", "name" "Structure of YebY from E. coli K12"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10709" "Protein of unknown function (DUF2511)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein YebY", "short" "YebY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 175, "taxa" 1646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1626, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1621, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1247}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019648", :literature {"PUB00100158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pozzi R" "Coles M" "Linke D" "Kulik A" "Nega M" "Wohlleben W" "Stegmann E."], "ISO_journal" "Environ Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Environ Microbiol", "title" "Distinct mechanisms contribute to immunity in the lantibiotic NAI-107 producer strain Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "118-32", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25923468}, "PUB00100157" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hadley RC" "Zhitnitsky D" "Livnat-Levanon N" "Masrati G" "Vigonsky E" "Rose J" "Ben-Tal N" "Rosenzweig AC" "Lewinson O."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The copper-linked E. coli AZY operon: Structure, metal binding, and a possible physiological role in copper delivery.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "101445", "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34822841}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019648", "name" "Protein YebY", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 175}}}
