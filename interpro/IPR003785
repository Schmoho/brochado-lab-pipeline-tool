{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the enzymes creatininase and 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylaminopyrimidin-4(3H)-one 5'-monophosphate deformylase, also known as formamide hydrolase.</p>\n\n<p>Creatinase or creatinine amidohydrolase ([ec:3.5.2.10]) catalyses the hydrolysis of creatinine to creatine, which can then be metabolised to urea and sarcosine by creatinase ([ec:3.5.3.3]). Creatininase is a member of the urease-related amidohydrolase superfamily [[cite:PUB00021871]]. Formamide hydrolase catalyses the hydrolysis of the formamide of 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-monophosphate (FAPy) to form 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate (APy) ([ec:3.5.1.102]) [[cite:PUB00056772]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes 3-dehydro-scyllo-inosose hydrolase from the marine, hyperthermophilic bacterium<i>Thermotoga maritima</i>. The enzyme converts 3-dehydro-scyllo-inosose (diketo-inositol) to 5-dehydro-L-gluconate by catalysing ring-opening hydrolysis, and is a component of the myo-inositol degradation pathway.<i>T.  maritima</i>is unable to grow on myo-inositol as a single carbon source [[cite:PUB00086033]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1v7z", "name" "creatininase-product complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024087", "name" "Creatininase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35005" "3-DEHYDRO-SCYLLO-INOSOSE HYDROLASE"}, "pfam" {"PF02633" "Creatinine amidohydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Creatininase/formamide hydrolase", "short" "Creatininase/forma_Hydrolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 3708, "taxa" 15773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27307, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27211, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20895}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1527", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1527"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
