{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several nucleopolyhedrovirus occlusion-derived virus envelope E25 proteins. The N terminus of this protein is extremely hydrophobic, studies suggest that this defined hydrophobic domain is sufficient to direct the protein to induced membrane microvesicles within a baculovirus-infected cell nucleus and the viral envelope. In addition, movement of the protein into the nuclear envelope may initiate through cytoplasmic membranes, such as endoplasmic reticulum, and that transport into the nucleus may be mediated through the outer and inner nuclear membrane [[cite:PUB00008001]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05274" "Occlusion-derived virus envelope protein E25"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baculovirus occlusion-derived virus envelope, E25", "short" "Baculo_ODV-E25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 156, "sets" 0, "proteins" 155, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007938", :literature {"PUB00008001" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Hong T" "Summers MD" "Braunagel SC."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
