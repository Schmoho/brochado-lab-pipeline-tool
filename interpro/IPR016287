{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Beta-agarase is a glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GH16) member that hydrolyzes the internal beta-1,4-linkage of agarose, a hydrophilic polysaccharide found in the cell wall of Rhodophyceaea, marine red algae [[cite:PUB00029321], [cite:PUB00085081]]. Agarose is a linear chain of galactose units linked by alternating L-alpha-1,3-and D-beta-1,4-linkages that are additionally modified by a 3,6-anhydro-bridge. Agarose forms thermo-reversible gels that are widely used in the food industry or as a laboratory medium. While beta-agarases are also found in two other families derived from the sequence-based classification of glycosyl hydrolases (GH50, and GH86) the GH16 members are most abundant [[cite:PUB00085080]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ate", "name" "High resolution crystal structure of beta-porphyranase A from Zobellia galactanivorans"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02178" "Beta-agarase, member of glycosyl hydrolase family 16"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001097" "Agarase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-agarase", "short" "Beta_agarase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 84, "taxa" 569, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 535, "sets" 0, "proteins" 524, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 431}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
