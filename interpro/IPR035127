Homologs are found in strongylids A. ceylanicum, N. americanus, H. contortus and Angiostrongylus cantonensis, where the corresponding genes in A. cantonensis are expressed in L4 larvae. Thus this family members found in A. ceylaniucum have been named strongylid L4 proteins (SL4Ps). Although SL4Ps do not resemble any domains of known function, they do have a conspicuous number of charged residues (both acidic and basic) in their N-terminal, most highly conserved regions [[cite:PUB00085197]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17618" "Uncharacterized Strongylid L4 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterized strongylid L4 protein", "short" "SL4P"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 101, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 228, "sets" 0, "proteins" 209, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 151}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035127", :literature {"PUB00085197" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Schwarz EM" "Hu Y" "Antoshechkin I" "Miller MM" "Sternberg PW" "Aroian RV."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
