{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Translocation of proteins across the two membranes of Gram-negative bacteria can be carried out via a number of routes. Most proteins marked for export carry a secretion signal at their N terminus, and are secreted by the general secretory pathway. The signal peptide is cleaved as they pass through the outer membrane. Other secretion systems include the type III system found in a select group of Gram-negative plant and animal pathogens, and the CagA system of Helicobacter pylori [[cite:PUB00007662]].</p>\n\n<p>In some bacterial species, however, there exists a system that operates independently of the Sec pathway [[cite:PUB00007663]]. It selectively translocates periplasmic-bound molecules that are synthesised with, or are in close association with, \"partner\" proteins bearing an (S/T)RRXFLK twin arginine motif at the N terminus. The pathway is therefore termed the Twin-Arginine Translocation or TAT system. Surprisingly, the four components that make up the TAT system are structurally and mechanistically related to a pH-dependent import system in plant chloroplast thylakoid membranes [[cite:PUB00007663]]. The gene products responsible for the Sec-independent pathway are called TatA, TatB, TatC and TatE.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the related TatA, TatB and TatE proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02416" "mttA/Hcf106 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sec-independent protein translocase protein TatA/B/E", "short" "TatA/B/E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 78, "proteomes" 8271, "taxa" 32506, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 66950, "sets" 0, "proteins" 66933, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51759}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003369", :literature {"PUB00007663" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Berks BC" "Sargent F" "Palmer T."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
