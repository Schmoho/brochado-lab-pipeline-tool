{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins resident in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contain a C-terminal tetrapeptide, commonly known as Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) in mammals and His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that acts as a signal for their retrieval from subsequent compartments of the secretory pathway. The receptor for this signal is a ~26kDa Golgi membrane protein, initially identified as the ERD2 gene product in S. cerevisiae. The receptor molecule, known variously as the ER lumen protein retaining receptor or the 'KDEL receptor', is believed to cycle between the cis side of the Golgi apparatus and the ER. It has also been characterised in a number of other species, including plants, Plasmodium, Drosophila and mammals. In mammals, 2 highly related forms of the receptor are known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6i6h", "name" "Crystal structure of the KDEL receptor in the peptide bound state"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00952" "ER lumen protein retaining receptor signature 2", "PS00951" "ER lumen protein retaining receptor signature 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR10585" "ER LUMEN PROTEIN RETAINING RECEPTOR"}, "prints" {"PR00660" "ERLUMENR"}, "pfam" {"PF00810" "ER lumen protein retaining receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ER lumen protein retaining receptor", "short" "ER_ret_rcpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 157, "proteomes" 2687, "taxa" 9191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10507, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6931}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00732", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00732"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000133", :literature {"PUB00001233" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Townsley FM" "Wilson DW" "Pelham HR."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=8392934&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Mutational analysis of the human KDEL receptor: distinct structural requirements for Golgi retention, ligand binding and retrograde transport.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "2821-9", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8392934}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046923", "name" "ER retention sequence binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006621", "name" "protein retention in ER lumen", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000133", "name" "ER lumen protein retaining receptor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 200, "alignment:full" 6135}}}
