{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gas vesicles provide cells with buoyancy, enabling them to remain at the water surface. These organelles are generally synthesised by halophilic archaea and cyanobacteria, as well as some other prokaryotes. A cluster of 12-14 gvp genes (gvpMLKJIHGFEDACNO) is responsible for gas vesicle synthesis in Halobacterium sp. [[cite:PUB00014923]]. This family includes Gas vesicle proteins L and F (GvpL and GvpF), which are essential for gas vesicle formation and display sequence similarity to one another, both containing predicted coiled-coil domains that are often involved in self-oligomerisation.
