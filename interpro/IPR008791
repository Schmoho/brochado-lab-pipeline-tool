{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the activation of natural killer and T helper 1 cell responses principally by inducing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Several poxvirus genes encode proteins with sequence similarity to IL-18BPs. It has been shown that vaccinia, ectromelia and cowpox viruses secrete from infected cells a soluble IL-18BP (vIL-18BP) that may modulate the host antiviral response. The expression of vIL-18BPs by distinct poxvirus genera that cause local or general viral dissemination, or persistent or acute infections in the host, emphasises the importance of IL-18 in response to viral infections [[cite:PUB00011430]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3f62", "name" "Crystal Structure of Human IL-18 in complex with Ectromelia virus IL-18 Binding Protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05566" "Orthopoxvirus interleukin 18 binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Orthopoxvirus interleukin 18 binding", "short" "Orthopox_IL18-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 65, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 90, "sets" 0, "proteins" 90, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008791", :literature {"PUB00011430" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Smith VP" "Bryant NA" "Alcami A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
