{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>[interpro:IPR006079] represents the family of all lantibiotics related to gallidermin, including epidermin, mutatin, and nisin. This protein family is largely restricted to gallidermin-family lantibiotic cassettes, but also include orphan transporter cassettes in species that lack candidate lantibiotic precursor and synthetase genes. In most species, this subunit is paralogous to an adjacent gene. This entry represents lantibiotic ABC transporter permease subunits SpaE/MutE/EpiE-like, which are highly hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins, and part of the bacitracin ABC transport system that confers resistance to the Gram-positive bacteria in which this system operates [[cite:PUB00102213], [cite:PUB00102214], [cite:PUB00145703]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21807" "lantibiotic immunity ABC transporter MutE/EpiE family permease (also called ABC-2 transporter MutE/EpiE family permease) subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03732" "lantibiotic immunity ABC transporter MutE/EpiE family permease subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lantibiotic ABC transporter permease subunit, SpaE/MutE/EpiE-like", "short" "Lanti_perm_SpaE/MutE/EpiE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 310, "taxa" 1393, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1312, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1055}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0853", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0853"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021205", :literature {"PUB00102214" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Otto M" "Peschel A" "Gotz F."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "title" "Producer self-protection against the lantibiotic epidermin by the ABC transporter EpiFEG of Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu3298.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "203-11", "volume" "166", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9770275}, "PUB00145703" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["AlKhatib Z" "Lagedroste M" "Zaschke J" "Wagner M" "Abts A" "Fey I" "Kleinschrodt D" "Smits SH."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiologyopen", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiologyopen", "title" "The C-terminus of nisin is important for the ABC transporter NisFEG to confer immunity in Lactococcus lactis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "752-63", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25176038}, "PUB00102213" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["McBride SM" "Sonenshein AL."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Immun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Infect Immun", "title" "Identification of a genetic locus responsible for antimicrobial peptide resistance in Clostridium difficile.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "167-76", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20974818}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021205", "name" "Lantibiotic ABC transporter permease subunit, SpaE/MutE/EpiE-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
