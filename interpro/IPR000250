{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The peptidases in family G1 form a subset of what were formerly termed 'pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinases'. After its discovery in about 1970, the pentapeptide pepstatin soon came to be thought of as a very general inhibitor of the endopeptidases that are active at acidic pH. But more recently several acid-acting endopeptidases from bacteria and fungi had been found to be resistant to pepstatin. The unusual active sites of the 'pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl peptidases' proved difficult to characterise, but it has now been established that the enzymes from bacteria are acid-acting serine peptidases in family S53 (clan SB), [interpro:IPR000209], whereas the fungal enzymes are in family G1 (formerly A4) [[cite:PUB00041696]]. The importance of glutamate ('E') and glutamine ('Q') residues in the active sites of the family G1 enzymes led to the family name, Eqolisin [[cite:PUB00015132]].</p>\n\n<p>This group of glutamate/glutamine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family G1 (eqolisin family, clan GA). An example of this group is scytalidoglutamic peptidase. The proteins are thermostable, pepstatin insensitive and are active at low pH ranges [[cite:PUB00003579]]. The enzyme has a unique heterodimeric structure, with a 39-residue light chain and a 173-residue heavy chain bound to each other non-covalently [[cite:PUB00002659]]. The tertiary structure of the active site of scytalidoglutamic peptidase (MEROPS G01.001) with a bound tripeptide product has been interpreted as showing that Glu136 is the primary catalytic residue. The most likely mechanism is suggested to be nucleophilic attack by a water molecule activated by the Glu136 side chain on the si-face of the scissile peptide bond carbon atom to form the tetrahedral intermediate. Electrophilic assistance, and oxyanion stabilisation, are provided by the side-chain amide of Gln53.</p>\n\n<p>Both scytalidoglutamic peptidase (MEROPS G01.001) and aspergilloglutamic peptidase (MEROPS G01.002) cleave the Tyr26 Thr27 bond in the B chain of oxidized insulin; a bond not cleaved by other acid-acting endopeptidases. Scytalidoglutamic peptidase is most active on casein at pH 2 and is inhibited by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane (EPNP), a compound that also inhibits pepsin.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ifr", "name" "Crystal structure of Scytalido-glutamic peptidase with a peptide based transition state analog"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013320", "name" "Concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038656", "name" "Peptidase G1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37536" "PUTATIVE (AFU_ORTHOLOGUE AFUA_3G02970)-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR00977" "SCYTLDPTASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01828" "Peptidase A4 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase G1", "short" "Peptidase_G1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 826, "taxa" 2554, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4012, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3942, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2506}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
