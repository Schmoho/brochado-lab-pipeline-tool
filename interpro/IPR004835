{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Chitin synthase ([ec:2.4.1.16]), also known as chitin-UDP acetyl-glucosaminyl transferase, is a plasma membrane-bound protein which catalyses the conversion of UDP-N-acettyl-D-glucosamine and  {(1,4)-(N-acetyl- beta-D-glucosaminyl)}(N) to UDP and {(1,4)-(N-acetyl-beta-D-\nglucosaminyl)}(N+1) to produce chitin, an abundant biopolymer found in a diverse group of organisms, ranging from fungal species to insects and crustaceans [[cite:PUB00096620]]. Chitin synthases are grouped into six classes (I-VI), classes I to III comprise one family, which are smaller proteins (average 900 amino acids) and classes IV to VI comprise a second family whose proteins have an average size of nearly 1,200 amino acids [[cite:PUB00096620]]. It plays a major role in cell wall biogenesis in fungi, as chitin is crucial for the maintenance of cell morphology [[cite:PUB00096626], [cite:PUB00096627]] and in C. elegans is essential during embryogenesis providing mechanical support and chemical impermeability [[cite:PUB00096621], [cite:PUB00096622]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22914" "CHITIN SYNTHASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chitin synthase", "short" "Chitin_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1769, "taxa" 7026, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20828, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20828, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9854}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
