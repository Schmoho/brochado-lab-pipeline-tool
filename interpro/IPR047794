{:metadata {:description [{"text" "Members of this family include hydrolases and N-acyltransferases that belong to the Ntn (N-terminal nucleophile) hydrolase family. Members have an invariant Cys residue required both for autoproteolytic processing into alpha and beta chains and for activity. Members of this entry are described by MEROPs as a cysteine protease, family C45, because of its autoproteolytic activity. Characterised members include TAN from Drosophila, which removes beta-alanine from both carcinine and N-beta-alanyl dopamine  [[cite:PUB00105810]], and isopenicillin-N N-acyltransferase from various fungi. The latter has been heavily studied because of its role in penicillin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00105811], [cite:PUB00070795], [cite:PUB00054422]].
