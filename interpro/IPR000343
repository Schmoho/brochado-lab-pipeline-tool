{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the obligatory precursor for the synthesis of all tetrapyrroles including porphyrin derivatives such as chlorophyll and heme. ALA can be synthesized via two different pathways: the Shemin (or C4) pathway which involves the single step condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine and which is catalyzed by ALA synthase and via the C5 pathway from the five-carbon skeleton of glutamate. The C5 pathway operates in the chloroplast of plants and algae, in cyanobacteria, in some eubacteria and in archaebacteria [[cite:PUB00005387]].</p>\n\n<p>The initial step in the C5 pathway is carried out by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) which catalyzes the NADP-dependent conversion of glutamate- tRNA(Glu) to glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) with the concomitant release of tRNA(Glu) which can then be recharged with glutamate by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase [[cite:PUB00005387]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents glutamyl-tRNA reductase ([ec:1.2.1.70]), which required NADPH as a coenzyme [[cite:PUB00009744], [cite:PUB00005387]].
