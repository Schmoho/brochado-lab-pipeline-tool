{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gram-positive bacteria transport macromolecules across the membrane through a multi-subunit membrane protein complex known as the type VII secretion system (T7SS). This family is represents homologues of TipC (also known as TipC1), an immunity protein for the toxin TelC, which is a type VII secretion system (T7SS) effector lipid II phosphatase [[cite:PUB00105378]]. It was shown that TipC localises to the plasma membrane via an N-terminal transmembrane domain and that the upstream soluble region of TipC is sufficient to inhibit the toxic lipid II phosphatase activity of TelC [[cite:PUB00105378], [cite:PUB00151255]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6dhx", "name" "Structure of TipC2 from Streptococcus intermedius B196"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033863" "TipC family immunity protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TipC immunity protein-like", "short" "TipC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 510, "sets" 0, "proteins" 510, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 415}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048042", :literature {"PUB00105378" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Klein TA" "Pazos M" "Surette MG" "Vollmer W" "Whitney JC."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Molecular Basis for Immunity Protein Recognition of a Type VII Secretion System Exported Antibacterial Toxin.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "4344-4358", "volume" "430", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30194969}, "PUB00151255" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Whitney JC" "Peterson SB" "Kim J" "Pazos M" "Verster AJ" "Radey MC" "Kulasekara HD" "Ching MQ" "Bullen NP" "Bryant D" "Goo YA" "Surette MG" "Borenstein E" "Vollmer W" "Mougous JD."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.26938", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "A broadly distributed toxin family mediates contact-dependent antagonism between gram-positive bacteria.
