{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The syntrophin family are intracellular membrane-associated proteins that interact with both ion channels and signalling proteins. As such, syntrophins appear to be important for linking ion channels to intracellular signalling pathways. Syntrophins are concentrated at postsynaptic sites at the neuromuscular junction and may be involved in clustering acetylcholine receptors. In muscle and non-muscle tissues, syntrophin is associated with dystrophin, utrophin, and two homologues of the dystrophin carboxy-terminal region [[cite:PUB00034889]].</p>\n\n<p>The five known syntrophin isoforms share a common domain organisation which includes two tandem pleckstrin homology (PH) domains at the N terminus, a PDZ domain and a C-terminal domain of ~70 amino acids that is unique to syntrophins (syntrophin unique, SU) [[cite:PUB00034890]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qav", "name" "Unexpected Modes of PDZ Domain Scaffolding Revealed by Structure of NNOS-Syntrophin Complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10554" "SYNTROPHIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Syntrophin", "short" "Syntrophin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1025, "taxa" 3981, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6407, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015482", :literature {"PUB00034889" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Adams ME" "Butler MH" "Dwyer TM" "Peters MF" "Murnane AA" "Froehner SC."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0896-6273(93)90157-M", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "Two forms of mouse syntrophin, a 58 kd dystrophin-associated protein, differ in primary structure and tissue distribution.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "531-40", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7691103}, "PUB00034890" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Froehner SC" "Adams ME" "Peters MF" "Gee SH."], "ISO_journal" "Soc.
