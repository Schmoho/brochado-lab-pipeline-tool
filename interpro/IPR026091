{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a disorder of organelle biogenesis in which oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding and pulmonary fibrosis result from defects of melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes [[cite:PUB00059924]]. HPS is common in Puerto Rico, where is mostly caused by mutations in the genes HPS1 or HPS3. Another HPS locus, HPS4 was identified by using mouse models [[cite:PUB00059994]]. It was suggested that HPS4 and HPS1 proteins may function in the same pathway of organelle biogenesis [[cite:PUB00059994]].</p>\n\n<p>This family represents BLOC-3 complex member HPS4, a component of the BLOC-3 complex, a complex that acts as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for RAB32 and RAB38, promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting them from an inactive GDP-bound form into an active GTP-bound form. The BLOC-3 complex plays an important role in the control of melanin production and melanosome biogenesis and promotes the membrane localization of RAB32 and RAB38 [[cite:PUB00094653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14407" "HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 4 PROTEIN LIGHT-EAR PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BLOC-3 complex member HPS4", "short" "HPS4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 842, "taxa" 3427, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1675, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1675, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1076}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026091", :literature {"PUB00059924" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Oh J" "Bailin T" "Fukai K" "Feng GH" "Ho L" "Mao JI" "Frenk E" "Tamura N" "Spritz RA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
