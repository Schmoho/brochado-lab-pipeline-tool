{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes across the cytoplasmic membrane. Most of the bacterial ABC (ATP-binding cassette) importers are composed of one or two transmembrane permease proteins, one or two nucleotide-binding proteins and a highly specific periplasmic solute-binding protein. In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the basis of sequence similarities, the vast majority of these solute-binding proteins can be grouped into eight family clusters [[cite:PUB00003610]], which generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound.
