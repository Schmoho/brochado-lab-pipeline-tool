{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of herpes-type viral small capsid proteins, including UL48A (small capsomere-interacting protein or SCP) from human cytomegalovirus [[cite:PUB00075752]].  By analogy with SCP from human herpesvirus 1, SCP forms a complex with the major capsid protein in the cytoplasm which is translocated to the nucleus. SCP decorates the outer surface of the capsid shell during capsid assembly, forming a layer between the capsid and the tegument.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04021" "Small capsomere-interacting protein [SCP]"}, "pfam" {"PF17086" "Small capsid protein of Herpesviridae"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small capsid protein, Herpesviridae", "short" "HV_small_capsid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 122, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 66, "sets" 0, "proteins" 66, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031385", :literature {"PUB00075752" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Gibson W" "Clopper KS" "Britt WJ" "Baxter MK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
