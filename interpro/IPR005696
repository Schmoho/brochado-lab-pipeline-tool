{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacteriocins are antibacterial proteinaceous compounds produced by bacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, they are divided into four classes. Within the class II, constituted by non-modified peptides produced mainly by lactic acid bacteria, bacteriocins of the subclass IIa (also known as pediocin-like bacteriocins), such as mesentericin Y105, are of particular interest. They are active against the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and share a similar primary structure, with a conserved N-terminal motif (YGNGV). Subclass IIa bacteriocins induce membrane permeabilization of sensitive strains [[cite:PUB00087441]]. Class-IId contains the one-peptide non-cyclic bacteriocins that show no sequence similarity to the pediocin-like bacteriocins, and include lactococcin A (LcnA) [[cite:PUB00034682]].</p>\n\n<p>The translocation of most of the class II bacteriocins requires a type I secretion system which is composed of maturation and secretion protein and an accessory factor. MesD and MesE encode the dedicated transport system of mesentericin Y105 [[cite:PUB00087450]]. Secretion and maturation of LcnA depends on the two membrane proteins LcnC and LcnD [[cite:PUB00087451]]. This family consist of accessory factors such as MesE and LcnD. Their function remains unclear, but they are required for full production of these bacteriocins [[cite:PUB00087450], [cite:PUB00087451]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01000" "bacteriocin secretion accessory protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secretion protein MesE/LcnD", "short" "MesE/LcnD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 340, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 659, "sets" 0, "proteins" 659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 542}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005696", :literature {"PUB00087441" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Fremaux C" "Hechard Y" "Cenatiempo Y."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/13500872-141-7-1637", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Mesentericin Y105 gene clusters in Leuconostoc mesenteroides Y105.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "1637-45", "volume" "141 ( Pt 7)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7551032}, "PUB00034682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Cotter PD" "Hill C" "Ross RP."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
