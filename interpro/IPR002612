{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of adenovirus E1B 55kDa protein or large t-antigen. E1B 55kDa binds p53 the tumor suppressor protein converting it from a transcriptional activator which responds to damaged DNA in to an unregulated repressor of genes with a p53 binding site [[cite:PUB00003708]]. This protects the virus against p53 induced host antiviral responses and prevents apoptosis as induced by the adenovirus E1A protein [[cite:PUB00003708]].\r\nThe E1B region of adenovirus encodes two proteins E1B 55kDa, the large t-antigen as found in this family and E1B 19kDa [interpro:IPR002924], the small t-antigen. Both of these proteins inhibit E1A induced apoptosis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01696" "Adenovirus EB1 55K protein / large t-antigen"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus large t-antigen, E1B 55kDa protein", "short" "Adeno_E1B_55kDa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 369, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 527, "sets" 0, "proteins" 524, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002612", :literature {"PUB00003708" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Martin ME" "Berk AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
