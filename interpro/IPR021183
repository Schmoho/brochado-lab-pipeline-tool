{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) auxiliary subunit, which is a non-catalytic component of the NatA N-terminal acetyltransferase that catalyses acetylation of proteins beginning with Met-Ser, Met-Gly and Met-Ala. N-terminal acetylation plays a role in normal eukaryotic translation and processing, protecting against proteolytic degradation and protein turnover. NAT1 anchors ARD1 and NAT5 to the ribosome, and may present the N terminus of nascent polypeptides for acetylation [[cite:PUB00053448], [cite:PUB00053449]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12569" "N-terminal acetyltransferase A, auxiliary subunit"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000422" "N-terminal acetyltransferase A, auxiliary subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-terminal acetyltransferase A, auxiliary subunit", "short" "NatA_aux_su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 194, "proteomes" 2670, "taxa" 9168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7843, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7077, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4531}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1491", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1491"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021183", :literature {"PUB00053448" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Park EC" "Szostak JW."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "ARD1 and NAT1 proteins form a complex that has N-terminal acetyltransferase activity.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "2087-93", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1600941}, "PUB00053449" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Gautschi M" "Just S" "Mun A" "Ross S" "Rucknagel P" "Dubaquie Y" "Ehrenhofer-Murray A" "Rospert S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
