ADAM-TS proteases are zinc metalloendopeptidases, most of whose substrates are extracellular matrix (ECM) components, whereas ADAM-TS-like proteins lack a metalloprotease domain, reside in the ECM and have regulatory roles [[cite:PUB00090139]]. Examples of ADAM-TS-like proteins are papilin [[cite:PUB00085073]] and punctin [[cite:PUB00090140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix plays a critical role in establishing tissue architecture during development and in tissue degradation in diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and a variety of inflammatory conditions [[cite:PUB00017286], [cite:PUB00098765]]. The proteolytic enzymes responsible for this process are members of diverse protease families, including the secreted zinc metalloproteases (MPs) [[cite:PUB00017286]].</p>\n\n<p>ADAM-TS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) is closely related to the ADAM family (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) and is a subfamily of the MP family, consists of at least 20 members sharing a high degree of sequence similarity and conserved domain organisation [[cite:PUB00017264], [cite:PUB00017277]]. The defining domains of the ADAM-TS family are (from N- to C-termini) a pre-pro metalloprotease domain of the reprolysin type, a snake venom disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin type-I (TS) module, a cysteine-rich region, and a cysteine-free (spacer) domain [[cite:PUB00017277]]. Domain organisation following the spacer domain C terminus shows some variability in certain ADAM-TS members, principally in the number of additional TS domains. These enzymes have a wide-spectrum role in vascular biology and cardiovascular pathophysiology [[cite:PUB00098761]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of the ADAM-TS family have been implicated in a range of diseases [[cite:PUB00098762], [cite:PUB00090139], [cite:PUB00098765]]. For instance, members of this family have been found to participate directly in processes in the central nervous system (CNS) such as the regulation of brain plasticity [[cite:PUB00098764]]. ADAM-TS1 is reported to be involved in inflammation and cancer cachexia [[cite:PUB00017264]], whilst recessively inherited ADAM-TS2 mutations cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a disorder characterised clinically by severe skin fragility [[cite:PUB00017294]].
