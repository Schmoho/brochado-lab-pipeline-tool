{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Terpenes are among the largest groups of natural products and include compounds such as vitamins, cholesterol and carotenoids. The biosynthesis of all terpenoids begins with one or both of the two C5 precursors of the pathway: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In animals, fungi, and certain bacteria, the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP occurs via the well-known mevalonate pathway, however, a second, nonmevalonate terpenoid pathway has been identified in many eubacteria, algae, malaria parasite and the chloroplasts of higher plants [[cite:PUB00007255], [cite:PUB00097871], [cite:PUB00097870]].</p>\n\n<p>LytB(IspH) is the last enzyme in the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) in the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP, the nonmevalonate pathway, also known as MEP) pathway [[cite:PUB00007256]]. This enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster and forms a stable complex with ferredoxin, which suggests that ferredoxin/ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase redox system serves as the physiological electron donor for LytB [[cite:PUB00097870]]. Escherichia coli LytB protein had been found to regulate the activity of RelA (guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate synthetase I), which in turn controls the level of a regulatory metabolite. It is involved in penicillin tolerance and the stringent response [[cite:PUB00015324]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3dnf", "name" "Structure of (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl Diphosphate Reductase, the Terminal Enzyme of the Non-Mevalonate Pathway"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13944" "4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase"}, "panther" {"PTHR30426" "4-HYDROXY-3-METHYLBUT-2-ENYL DIPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00191" "4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase [ispH]"}, "pfam" {"PF02401" "LytB protein"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00216" "4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase", "short" "LytB/IspH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 91, "proteomes" 8390, "taxa" 32382, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40097, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30471}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1295", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1295"} {"accession" "GenProp0048", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0048"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
