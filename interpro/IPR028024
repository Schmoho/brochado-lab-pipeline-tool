{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (formerly known as UPF0694 transmembrane protein C14orf109, or transmembrane protein 251) are required for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes [[cite:PUB00101879], [cite:PUB00101880], [cite:PUB00101878]]. LYSET bridges GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (GNPTAB), to the membrane-bound transcription factor site-1 protease (MBTPS1), thus allowing proteolytic activation of the GNPTAB. GNPTAB is involved in the regulation of M6P-dependent Golgi-to-lysosome trafficking of lysosomal enzymes [[cite:PUB00101879], [cite:PUB00101880], [cite:PUB00101878]]. Members of this entry are essential factors for maturation and delivery of lysosomal hydrolases [[cite:PUB00101879]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15190" "Transmembrane protein 251"}, "panther" {"PTHR31925" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 251"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor", "short" "LYSET"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 610, "taxa" 2216, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 822, "sets" 0, "proteins" 819, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 590}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028024", :literature {"PUB00101880" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang W" "Yang X" "Li Y" "Yu L" "Zhang B" "Zhang J" "Cho WJ" "Venkatarangan V" "Chen L" "Burugula BB" "Bui S" "Wang Y" "Duan C" "Kitzman JO" "Li M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "GCAF(TMEM251) regulates lysosome biogenesis by activating the mannose-6-phosphate pathway.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "5351", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36096887}, "PUB00101878" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6615", "authors" ["Richards CM" "Jabs S" "Qiao W" "Varanese LD" "Schweizer M" "Mosen PR" "Riley NM" "Klussendorf M" "Zengel JR" "Flynn RA" "Rustagi A" "Widen JC" "Peters CE" "Ooi YS" "Xie X" "Shi PY" "Bartenschlager R" "Puschnik AS" "Bogyo M" "Bertozzi CR" "Blish CA" "Winter D" "Nagamine CM" "Braulke T" "Carette JE."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The human disease gene LYSET is essential for lysosomal enzyme transport and viral infection.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "eabn5648", "volume" "378", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36074821}, "PUB00101879" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6615", "authors" ["Pechincha C" "Groessl S" "Kalis R" "de Almeida M" "Zanotti A" "Wittmann M" "Schneider M" "de Campos RP" "Rieser S" "Brandstetter M" "Schleiffer A" "Muller-Decker K" "Helm D" "Jabs S" "Haselbach D" "Lemberg MK" "Zuber J" "Palm W."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor LYSET enables nutritional usage of extracellular proteins.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "eabn5637", "volume" "378", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36074822}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR028024", "name" "Lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 644}}}
