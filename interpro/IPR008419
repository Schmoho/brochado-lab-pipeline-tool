{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of p25 and p26 proteins from the Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), which is a plant pathogenic virus [[cite:PUB00076451]]. It is characterised by a positive-stranded single stranded RNA genome that is rod-shaped and non-enveloped in nature. The virus is transmitted by Polymyxa betae, a fungus from the order Plasmodiophorales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>p25 is an RNA-3-encoded protein that is responsible for the production of rhizomania symptoms of sugar beet roots [[cite:PUB00076453]]. An estimate of the ratio between synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates (omega) with maximum-likelihood models showed that the p25 sequences presented the highest (of three benyvirus proteins) mean omega values with strong positive selection acting on 14 amino acids, and particularly on amino acid 68, where the omega value was the highest so far encountered in plant viruses [[cite:PUB00043609]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05744" "Benyvirus P25/P26 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Benyvirus p25/p26", "short" "BNYVV_p25/p26"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 15, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 416, "sets" 0, "proteins" 416, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008419", :literature {"PUB00076451" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bornemann K" "Varrelmann M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
