{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>One of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the progressive formation in the brain of insoluble amyloid plaques and vascular deposits consisting of beta-amyloid protein (beta-APP) [[cite:PUB00013925]]. Production of beta-APP requires proteolytic cleavage of the large type-1 transmembrane (TM) protein amyloid precursor protein (APP) [[cite:PUB00013732]]. This process is performed by a variety of enzymes known as secretases. To initiate beta-APP formation, beta-secretase cleaves APP to release a soluble N-terminal fragment (APPsBeta) and a C-terminal fragment that remains membrane bound. This fragment is subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to liberate beta-APP.</p>\n\n<p>Several independent studies identified a novel TM aspartic protease as the major beta-secretase [[cite:PUB00013926], [cite:PUB00013927], [cite:PUB00013928]]. This protein, termed beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), shares 64% amino acid sequence similarity with a second enzyme, termed BACE2. Together, BACE1 and BACE2 define a novel family of aspartyl proteases [[cite:PUB00013929]]. Both enzymes share significant sequence similarity with other members of the pepsin family of aspartyl proteases and contain the two characteristic D(T/S)G(T/S) motifs that form the catalytic site. However, by contrast with other aspartyl proteases, BACE1 and BACE2 are type I TM proteins. Each protein comprises a large lumenal domain containing the active centre, a single TM domain and a small cytoplasmic tail.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR021109", "name" "Aspartic peptidase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01815" "Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-secretase BACE", "short" "BACE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 447, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 693, "taxa" 2536, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14023, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2263, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1490}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
