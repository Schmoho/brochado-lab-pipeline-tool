{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the yeast LYS21 gene which carries out the first step of the alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) lysine biosynthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00063143], [cite:PUB00063144]].  A related pathway is found in Thermus thermophilus [[cite:PUB00015490]].  This enzyme is closely related to 2-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA) and citramalate synthase (CimA), both of which are present in the euryarchaeota.
