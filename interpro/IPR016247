{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of two structurally related proteins, Ror1 and Ror2. Ror1 is a pseudokinase that acts as a substrate for the oncogenic tyrosine kinase Met [[cite:PUB00076692]]. It is expressed during development [[cite:PUB00076691]]. It shows no significant expression in normal adult tissues, but it is selectively overexpressed in a number of malignancies [[cite:PUB00076689]]. Ror2 functions as a Wnt receptor required to maintain basal NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission [[cite:PUB00076690]]. For a time its ligand remained elusive, hence the name receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor-2 (Ror2). It is now established that Wnt5A acts a ligand for Ror2 [[cite:PUB00076693]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000624" "Tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine-protein kinase, receptor ROR", "short" "Tyr_kinase_rcpt_ROR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 612, "taxa" 2077, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1810, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1606, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1059}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
