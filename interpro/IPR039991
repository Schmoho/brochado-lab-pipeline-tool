{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Shortage in chiasmata 1 orthologue, the plant SHOC1 orthologue in animals, has been shown to act at mid-stage steps of the crossover (CO) formation process. It also interacts with TEX11, another protein important for the formation of COs. SHOC1 has associated ATPase activity, but lacks endonuclease activity, so it has been speculated that SHOC1 may protect against dissociation by anti-crossover activities instead of having a role in cleaving recombination intermediates to produce COs [[cite:PUB00090399]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17825" "Family of unknown function (DUF5587)"}, "panther" {"PTHR35668" "PROTEIN SHORTAGE IN CHIASMATA 1 ORTHOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein shortage in chiasmata 1 ortholog", "short" "SHOC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 492, "taxa" 1972, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1292, "sets" 0, "proteins" 951, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 349}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039991", :literature {"PUB00090399" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Guiraldelli MF" "Felberg A" "Almeida LP" "Parikh A" "de Castro RO" "Pezza RJ."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007381", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "SHOC1 is a ERCC4-(HhH)2-like protein, integral to the formation of crossover recombination intermediates during mammalian meiosis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "e1007381", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29742103}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016887", "name" "ATP hydrolysis activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000712", "name" "resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000794", "name" "condensed nuclear chromosome", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039991", "name" "Protein shortage in chiasmata 1 ortholog", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 923}}}
