{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of known phosphorylases, and homologues believed to share the function of using inorganic phosphate to cleave an alpha 1,4 linkage between the terminal glucose residue and the rest of the polymer (maltodextrin, glycogen, etc.). The name of the glucose storage polymer substrate, and therefore the name of this enzyme, depends on the chain lengths and branching patterns. A number of the members of this family have been shown to operate on small maltodextrins, as may be obtained by utilization of exogenous sources. This family represents a distinct clade from the related families: Glycogen/starch/alpha-glucan phosphorylase and Glycosyl transferase, family 35.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02094" "alpha-glucan family phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-glucan phosphorylase", "short" "Agluc_phsphrylas"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2803, "taxa" 11922, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16649, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15337, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11016}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
