{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death (PCD), is a common and evolutionarily conserved property of all metazoans [[cite:PUB00017281]]. In many biological processes, apoptosis is required to eliminate supernumerary or dangerous (such as pre-cancerous) cells and to promote normal development. Dysregulation of apoptosis can, therefore, contribute to the development of many major diseases including cancer, autoimmunity and neurodegenerative disorders. In most cases, proteins of the caspase family execute the genetic programme that leads to cell death.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents an ER-localized apoptosis regulator, M-T4 type. M-T4 has both an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal -RDEL sequence, suggesting that M-T4 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. M-T4 is an intracellular virulence factor in myxoma virus that functions from within the endoplasmic reticulum and is necessary for the productive infection of lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00043500]]. The C-terminal RDEL motif of the myxoma virus M-T4 protein may not be solely responsible for retention of M-T4 in the ER. M-T4 may have a dual function in protecting infected lymphocytes from apoptosis and in modulating the inflammatory response to virus infection [[cite:PUB00010024]].
