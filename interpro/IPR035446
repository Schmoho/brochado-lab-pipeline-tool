{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Brassica species, S locus glycoproteins (SLGs) are involved in self-incompatibility, a mechanism that regulates the acceptance or rejection of pollen to prevent self-fertilization [[cite:PUB00073619], [cite:PUB00085386]]. SLGs accumulate in papillar cells of the stigma, at the site where inhibition of self-pollen tube development has been shown to occur [[cite:PUB00085388]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family also includes related proteins from Arabidopsis and epidermis-specific secreted glycoprotein EP1 from carrot, which has sequence homology to Brassica SLGs. EP1 is not involved in self-incompatibility, and its expression in seedlings rules out an specific role in pollination.
