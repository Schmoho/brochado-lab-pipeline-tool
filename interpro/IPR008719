{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NosL is one of the accessory proteins of the nos (nitrous oxide reductase) gene cluster. NosL is a monomeric protein of 18,540 MW that specifically and stoichiometrically binds Cu(I). The copper ion in NosL is ligated by a Cys residue, and one Met and one His are thought to serve as the other ligands. It is possible that NosL is a copper chaperone involved in metallocentre assembly [[cite:PUB00011406]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also contains  HTH-type transcriptional repressors, including YcnK.  YcnK may act as a negative transcriptional regulator of YcnJ in the presence of copper and may use copper as a corepressor. The gene, ycnK, is significantly induced under copper-limiting conditions [[cite:PUB00066868]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7og7", "name" "Crystal structure of the copper chaperone NosL from Shewanella denitrificans"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05573" "NosL"}, "panther" {"PTHR41247" "HTH-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR YCNK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrous oxide reductase accessory protein NosL", "short" "N2O_reductase_NosL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 1322, "taxa" 6057, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7636, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7475, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5727}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008719", :literature {"PUB00011406" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["McGuirl MA" "Bollinger JA" "Cosper N" "Scott RA" "Dooley DM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
