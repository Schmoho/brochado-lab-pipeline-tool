{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ABC transporter family is a group of membrane proteins that use the hydrolysis of ATP to power the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). Eukaryotic ABC proteins are usually organised either as full transporters (containing two NBDs and two TMDs), or as half transporters (containing one NBD and one TMD), that have to form homo- or heterodimers in order to constitute a functional protein [[cite:PUB00072552]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes Tap1/2 (transporter associated with antigen processing 1/2) and its homologue, Mdl2, from budding yeasts.
