{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents interleukin-23 subunit alpha, IL-23A (also known as Interleukin-23 subunit p19) associates with IL-12B to form the IL-23 interleukin, a heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate and adaptive immunity [[cite:PUB00013064]]. IL-23 may constitute with IL-17 an acute response to infection in peripheral tissues. IL-23 binds to a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL12RB1 and IL23R, activates the Jak-Stat signaling cascade, stimulates memory rather than naive T-cells and promotes production of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-23 induces autoimmune inflammation and thus may be responsible for autoimmune inflammatory diseases and may be important for tumorigenesis [[cite:PUB00067932]]. Similar to IL-12, human IL-23 stimulates IFN-gamma production and proliferation in PHA blast T cells, as well as in CD45RO (memory) T cells [[cite:PUB00013064]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3d85", "name" "Crystal structure of IL-23 in complex with neutralizing FAB"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16649" "Interleukin 23 subunit alpha"}, "panther" {"PTHR15947" "SGRF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-23 alpha", "short" "IL-23_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 296, "taxa" 1038, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 366, "sets" 0, "proteins" 357, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 264}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010831", :literature {"PUB00013064" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Oppmann B" "Lesley R" "Blom B" "Timans JC" "Xu Y" "Hunte B" "Vega F" "Yu N" "Wang J" "Singh K" "Zonin F" "Vaisberg E" "Churakova T" "Liu M" "Gorman D" "Wagner J" "Zurawski S" "Liu Y" "Abrams JS" "Moore KW" "Rennick D" "de Waal-Malefyt R" "Hannum C" "Bazan JF" "Kastelein RA."], "ISO_journal" "Immunity", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1074-7613(00)00070-4", "medline_journal" "Immunity", "title" "Novel p19 protein engages IL-12p40 to form a cytokine, IL-23, with biological activities similar as well as distinct from IL-12.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "715-25", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11114383}, "PUB00067932" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Piskin G" "Sylva-Steenland RM" "Bos JD" "Teunissen MB."], "ISO_journal" "J.
