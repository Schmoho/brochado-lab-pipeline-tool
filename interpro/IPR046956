{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of Leucine rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like proteins (RLP) from plants, including RLP23 from Arabidopsis, which is a component of the RLP23-SOBIR1-BAK1 complex that mediates NLP-triggered immunity [[cite:PUB00098440], [cite:PUB00098441]]. Many members confer resistance to fungal pathogens. In Arabidopsis, at least 57 members have been described, some of them are known to be involved in basal developmental processes, whereas others are involved in defence responses [[cite:PUB00101463]]. RLP42 recognises fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs) and acts as a novel microbe-associated molecular pattern receptor [[cite:PUB00098442]]. Receptor-like protein 9DC3/9DC2 and Cf-9 homologue from Solanum pimpinellifolium are also included in this family. 9DC3 is involved in plant defence; it confers resistance to the fungal pathogen C.fulvum through recognition of the AVR9 elicitor protein [[cite:PUB00101465]]. Receptor-like protein EIX1 from Solanum lycopersicum confers resistance to the fungal pathogen T.viride through recognition of the EIX elicitor protein [[cite:PUB00155215]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5y9w", "name" "Crystal 1 for AtLURE1.2-AtPRK6LRR"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032675", "name" "Leucine-rich repeat domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48063" "LRR RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE", "PTHR48061" "LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT RECEPTOR PROTEIN KINASE EMS1-LIKE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor-like protein 23-like", "short" "RLP23-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 373, "taxa" 1963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24931, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24931, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15066}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046956", :literature {"PUB00098440" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Albert I" "Bohm H" "Albert M" "Feiler CE" "Imkampe J" "Wallmeroth N" "Brancato C" "Raaymakers TM" "Oome S" "Zhang H" "Krol E" "Grefen C" "Gust AA" "Chai J" "Hedrich R" "Van den Ackerveken G" "Nurnberger T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Plants", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Plants", "title" "An RLP23-SOBIR1-BAK1 complex mediates NLP-triggered immunity.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "15140", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27251392}, "PUB00098441" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ono E" "Mise K" "Takano Y."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "RLP23 is required for Arabidopsis immunity against the grey mould pathogen Botrytis cinerea.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "13798", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32796867}, "PUB00098442" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang L" "Kars I" "Essenstam B" "Liebrand TW" "Wagemakers L" "Elberse J" "Tagkalaki P" "Tjoitang D" "van den Ackerveken G" "van Kan JA."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Fungal endopolygalacturonases are recognized as microbe-associated molecular patterns by the arabidopsis receptor-like protein RESPONSIVENESS TO BOTRYTIS POLYGALACTURONASES1.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "352-64", "volume" "164", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24259685}, "PUB00101463" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Steidele CE" "Stam R."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Genomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Genomics", "title" "Multi-omics approach highlights differences between RLP classes in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "557", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34284718}, "PUB00101465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kruijt M" "Brandwagt BF" "de Wit PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Rearrangements in the Cf-9 disease resistance gene cluster of wild tomato have resulted in three genes that mediate Avr9 responsiveness.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1655-63", "volume" "168", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15579714}, "PUB00155215" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ron M" "Avni A."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.022475", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The receptor for the fungal elicitor ethylene-inducing xylanase is a member of a resistance-like gene family in tomato.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1604-15", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15155877}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046956", "name" "Receptor-like protein 23-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
