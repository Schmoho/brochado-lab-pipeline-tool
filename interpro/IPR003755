{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bifunctional HPr serine kinase/phosphorylase (HprK/P). It catalyses the phosphorylation of a specific serine residue in HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). It also catalyses thedephosphorylation of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P-Ser-HPr). The two antagonistic activities of HprK/P are regulated by several intracellular metabolites, which change their concentration in response to the absence or presence of rapidly metabolisable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, etc.) in the growth medium. HprK/P is the sensor in a multicomponent phosphorelay system that controls catabolite repression, sugar transport and carbon metabolism in Gram-positive bacteria [[cite:PUB00017535], [cite:PUB00068780]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ko7", "name" "X-ray structure of the HPr kinase/phosphatase from Staphylococcus xylosus at 1.95 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01249" "HPr kinase/phosphorylase [hprK]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00679" "HPr(Ser) kinase/phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HPr(Ser) kinase/phosphorylase", "short" "HPr(Ser)_kin/Pase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2751, "taxa" 10728, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12008, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12008, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9157}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0119", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0119"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
