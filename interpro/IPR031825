{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RXLR proteins constitute a family of phytopathogen avirulence or effector proteins. They are defined by a secretion signal peptide followed by a conserved N-terminal domain with the sequence motif RXLR (Arg-Xaa-Leu-Arg) consensus sequence. The RXLR part is required for translocation inside plant cells, although it appears to be dispensable for the biochemical activity of the effectors when expressed directly inside host cells.  The effector activity resides in the C-terminal part of the family, which activate effector-triggered immunity in plants that carry a corresponding resistance (R) protein. The C-terminal region exhibits a fold appears to be able to evolve to outwit the host as the latter tries to acquire new immunity [[cite:PUB00076071]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zr8", "name" "Crystal structure of RxLR effector Avr3a11 from Phytophthora capsici"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16810" "RXLR phytopathogen effector protein, Avirulence activity"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RXLR phytopathogen effector protein", "short" "RXLR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 41, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3175, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3096, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2456}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031825", :literature {"PUB00076071" {"URL" nil, "issue" "41", "authors" ["Boutemy LS" "King SR" "Win J" "Hughes RK" "Clarke TA" "Blumenschein TM" "Kamoun S" "Banfield MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
