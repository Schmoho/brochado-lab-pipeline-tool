{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In prokaryotes, the major role of DNA methylation is to protect host DNA against degradation by restriction enzymes. There are 2 major classes of DNA methyltransferase that differ in the nature of the modifications they effect. The members of one class (C-MTases) methylate a ring carbon and form C5-methylcytosine (see [interpro:IPR001525]). Members of the second class (N-MTases) methylate exocyclic nitrogens and form either N4-methylcytosine (N4-MTases) or N6-methyladenine (N6-MTases). Both classes of MTase utilise the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and are active as monomeric enzymes [[cite:PUB00000092]].</p>\n\n<p>N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylases ([ec:2.1.1.72]) (A-Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA. They include enzymes are found in bacterial restriction-modification systems, as well as solitary enzymes that do not have a restriction enzyme counterpart [[cite:PUB00033229]].</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this entry are homologous to Dam methyltransferase ([swissprot:P0AEE8]) from Escherichia coli which recognises the sequence GATC and methylates the adenine moeity. This protein is not part of a restriction modification system and its activity influences cellular functions such as gene transcription, DNA mismatch repair, initiation of chromosome replication and nucleoid structure [[cite:PUB00033230]]. It is dispensible in E. coli, but has been shown to be required for viability in Yersinia and Vibrio species, virulence in Salmonella, and replication in some bacteriophages. Dam methyltransferase consists of a seven-stranded β sheet sandwiched between two layers of α helices [[cite:PUB00023029], [cite:PUB00022490]]. The β sheet contains the catalytic domain, while the target recognition domain is composed of five α helices and a β hairpin. The methyl donor binds to a region of the β sheet, surrounded by conserved residues, which is next to a narrow surface pocket thought to contain the active site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2g1p", "name" "Structure of E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (DAM)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023095", "name" "Adenine-specific methyltransferase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000398" "Modification methylase (adenine-specific), M.EcoRV type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenine modification methylase, M.EcoRV-type", "short" "M_m6A_EcoRV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2518, "taxa" 14312, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17535, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17493, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13090}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
