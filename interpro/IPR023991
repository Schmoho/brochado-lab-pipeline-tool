{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are described variably as bacteriocins per se, one chain of a two-chain bacteriocin, or bacteriocin enhancer proteins. All members of the seed alignment occur in paired gene contexts with another member of the same protein family. This family includes bacteriocins that appear not to undergo post-translational modification, other than cleavage at a Gly-Gly motif coupled to sec-independent export. For many members, the N-terminal bacteriocin cleavage motif region is recognised by [ncbifam:TIGR01847]. C-terminal to the cleavage motif, these proteins are hydrophobic and low in complexity, consistent with pore-forming activity as a mechanism of bacteriocin action.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03949" "class IIb bacteriocin, lactobin A/cerein 7B family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriocin, class IIb, lactobin A/cerein 7B family", "short" "Bacteriocin_IIb_lactobn/cerein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 120, "taxa" 1074, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1066, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1066, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 890}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023991", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023991", "name" "Bacteriocin, class IIb, lactobin A/cerein 7B family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
