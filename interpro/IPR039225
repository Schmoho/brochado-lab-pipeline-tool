{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcription factor Gibbin, also known as AT-hook DNA-binding motif-containing protein 1 (AHDC1), is a transcription factor required for the proper patterning of the epidermis, which plays a key role in early epithelial morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00101327]]. It directly binds promoter and enhancer regions and acts by maintaining local enhancer-promoter chromatin architecture. It interacts with many sequence-specific zinc-finger transcription factors and methyl-CpG-binding proteins to regulate the expression of mesoderm genes that wire surface ectoderm stratification [[cite:PUB00101327]]. Truncating mutations in the gene lead to a syndrome in which patients suffered hypotonia, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, mildly dysmorphic facial features and in some cases sleep apnea [[cite:PUB00089321]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15617" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GIBBIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor Gibbin", "short" "AHDC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 476, "taxa" 1742, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 714, "sets" 0, "proteins" 714, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 107}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039225", :literature {"PUB00101327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7912", "authors" ["Collier A" "Liu A" "Torkelson J" "Pattison J" "Gaddam S" "Zhen H" "Patel T" "McCarthy K" "Ghanim H" "Oro AE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Gibbin mesodermal regulation patterns epithelial development.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "188-196", "volume" "606", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35585237}, "PUB00089321" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Xia F" "Bainbridge MN" "Tan TY" "Wangler MF" "Scheuerle AE" "Zackai EH" "Harr MH" "Sutton VR" "Nalam RL" "Zhu W" "Nash M" "Ryan MM" "Yaplito-Lee J" "Hunter JV" "Deardorff MA" "Penney SJ" "Beaudet AL" "Plon SE" "Boerwinkle EA" "Lupski JR" "Eng CM" "Muzny DM" "Yang Y" "Gibbs RA."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
