{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A), now considered to be an elongation factor (see [interpro:IPR001884]), contains an unusual amino acid, hypusine [N epsilon-(4-aminobutyl-2-hydroxy)lysine]. The first step in the post-translational formation of hypusine is catalysed by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DS, [ec:2.5.1.46]). The enzyme catalyses the following reaction:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<reaction>\r\nSpermidine + [eIF-5A]-lysine = 1,3-diaminopropane + [eIF-5A]-deoxyhypusine\r\n</reaction>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The modified version of eIF-5A, and DS, are required for eukaryotic cell proliferation [[cite:PUB00005808]].
