{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein is predicted to span the membrane several times. It is only found in genomes of species that perform sporulation, such as Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium tetani, and other members of the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive bacteria). Mutation of this sigmaE-dependent gene blocks development of the spore cortex. The length of the C-terminal region, which includes some hydrophobic regions, is variable. This entry includes the Bacillus subtilis YabQ, which is essential for formation of the spore cortex [[cite:PUB00034419]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09578" "Spore cortex protein YabQ"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02893" "spore cortex biosynthesis protein YabQ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spore cortex biosynthesis protein, YabQ", "short" "YabQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 1100, "taxa" 3551, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3602, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3602, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2629}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019074", :literature {"PUB00034419" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Asai K" "Takamatsu H" "Iwano M" "Kodama T" "Watabe K" "Ogasawara N."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/147/4/919", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "The Bacillus subtilis yabQ gene is essential for formation of the spore cortex.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "919-27", "volume" "147", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11283287}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019074", "name" "Spore cortex biosynthesis protein, YabQ", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 150, "alignment:full" 1136}}}
