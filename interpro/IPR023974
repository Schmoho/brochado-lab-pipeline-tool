{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This rare conserved hypothetical protein of small size occurs exclusively, and perhaps universally, in the context of a pair of (uncharacterised) radical SAM proteins, HxsC ([interpro:IPR024032]) and HxsB ([interpro:IPR024023]). Many members of this family have invariant motifs LYW and LLNDYxLRE, but PSI-BLAST starting from family members well below 20% pairwise sequence identity to this group eventually brings in the entire family as modeled here.
