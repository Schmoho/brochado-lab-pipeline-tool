{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The RNA polymerase I specific transcription initiation factor Rrn11 is a member of a multiprotein complex essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I, together with Rrn6 and Rrn7 subunits [[cite:PUB00099775], [cite:PUB00100002]]. Binding to the DNA template is dependent on the initial binding of other factors [[cite:PUB00020262]]. Rrn11 contains a tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and interacts with Rrn6 and Rrn7 to form the core factor (CF), which resembles a right hand holding the DNA molecule between the fingers and the palm. The palm is composed of the N-terminal regions of both Rrn11 and Rrn6, the thumb is composed of the C-terminal of Rrn11, and the fingers and knuckles are composed of Rrn7 and the C-terminal half of Rrn6, respectively [[cite:PUB00100002]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF027133" "Core factor complex, Rrn11 component"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation factor Rrn11, budding yeast", "short" "TIF_Rrn11_budding_yeast"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016850", :literature {"PUB00020262" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Boukhgalter B" "Liu M" "Guo A" "Tripp M" "Tran K" "Huynh C" "Pape L."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(02)00597-8", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Characterization of a fission yeast subunit of an RNA polymerase I essential transcription initiation factor, SpRrn7h/TAF(I)68, that bridges yeast and mammals: association with SpRrn11h and the core ribosomal RNA gene promoter.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "187-201", "volume" "291", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12095692}, "PUB00099775" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Engel C" "Gubbey T" "Neyer S" "Sainsbury S" "Oberthuer C" "Baejen C" "Bernecky C" "Cramer P."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structural Basis of RNA Polymerase I Transcription Initiation.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "120-131.e22", "volume" "169", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28340337}, "PUB00100002" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Han Y" "Yan C" "Nguyen THD" "Jackobel AJ" "Ivanov I" "Knutson BA" "He Y."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Structural mechanism of ATP-independent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase I.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28623663}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007224", "name" "Transcription initiation factor Rrn11", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016850", "name" "Transcription initiation factor Rrn11, budding yeast", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
