{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group contains homologues of Escherichia coli YrdC with an additional unique short (~100 aa) C-terminal domain. In accordance with its proposed role as a translation factor, YrdC preferentially binds dsRNA, likely via a depression on the surface of the protein [[cite:PUB00011086]]. However, members of both this group lack the C-terminal domain that has been shown to be essential for the regulatory (probably translational) function of the related two-domain protein SUA5 ([pirsf:PIRSF004930]) [[cite:PUB00011089]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017945", "name" "DHBP synthase RibB-like alpha/beta domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036543" "Predicted RNA-binding protein, Chlamydia YrdC type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Predicted RNA-binding protein YdrC-type, Chlamydia", "short" "YdrC-type_chlamyd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 27, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011416", :literature {"PUB00011086" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Teplova M" "Tereshko V" "Sanishvili R" "Joachimiak A" "Bushueva T" "Anderson WF" "Egli M."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11206077", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "The structure of the yrdC gene product from Escherichia coli reveals a new fold and suggests a role in RNA binding.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2557-66", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11206077}, "PUB00011089" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Na JG" "Pinto I" "Hampsey M."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://intl.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/131/4/791", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "Isolation and characterization of SUA5, a novel gene required for normal growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "791-801", "volume" "131", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1325384}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR011416", "name" "Predicted RNA-binding protein YdrC-type, Chlamydia", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
