{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ketol-acid reductoisomerases (KARI) catalyses two steps in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. The reaction involves an Mg2+ dependent alkyl migration followed by an NADPH-dependent reduction of the 2-keto group. There are two groups of KARI enzymes: class I is a short form found in fungi and most bacteria, and class II is a long form found in plants and certain bacteria (although their sequences differ) [[cite:PUB00034453], [cite:PUB00036035]]. However, there has also been a long form found in certain bacteria, but these differ from class II sequences found in plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry consists of bacterial and archaeal KARI.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8pru", "name" "Engineered form of T thermophiles AHIR"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008927", "name" "6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000116" "Ketol-acid reductoisomerase, Gammaproteobacteria type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ketol-acid reductoisomerase, prokaryotic", "short" "KARI_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6892, "taxa" 25991, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 54270, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27810, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21706}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
