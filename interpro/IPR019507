{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The IA3 polypeptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as Pai3) is an 8kDa inhibitor of the vacuolar aspartic proteinase (proteinase A or saccharopepsin, MEROPS peptidase family A1). It belongs to MEROPS inhibitor family I34, clan JA. No other aspartic proteinase has been found to be inhibited by IA3, and at least 15 aspartic proteinases related to YprA cleave IA3 as a substrate. Ligand- free IA3 has little intrinsic secondary structure, however, upon contact with proteinase A, residues 2-32 of the inhibitor become ordered and adopt a near perfect Î±-helical conformation occupying the active site cleft of the enzyme. This potent, specific interaction is directed primarily by hydrophobic interactions made by three key features in the inhibitory sequence [[cite:PUB00010637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dpj", "name" "THE STRUCTURE OF PROTEINASE A COMPLEXED WITH IA3 PEPTIDE INHIBITOR"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008956", "name" "Protease A inhibitor IA3 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10466" "Saccharopepsin inhibitor I34"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protease A inhibitor IA3", "short" "Pai3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019507", :literature {"PUB00010637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Phylip LH" "Lees WE" "Brownsey BG" "Bur D" "Dunn BM" "Winther JR" "Gustchina A" "Li M" "Copeland T" "Wlodawer A" "Kay J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
