{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arp2/3 binds to pre-existing actin filaments and nucleates new daughter filaments, and thus becomes incorporated into the dynamic actin network at the leading edge of motile cells and other actin-based protrusive structures [[cite:PUB00035127]]. In order to nucleate filaments, Arp2/3 must bind to a member of the N-WASp/SCAR family protein [[cite:PUB00020552]]. Arp2 and Arp3 are thought to be brought together after activation, forming an actin-like nucleus for actin monomers to bind and create a new actin filament. In the absence of an activating protein, Arp2/3 shows very little nucleation activity. Recent research has focused on the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Arp2 and Arp3 [[cite:PUB00035128]], and crystal structures of the Arp2/3 complex have been solved [[cite:PUB00022758]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The human Arp2/3 complex composed of ARP2, ARP3, ARPC1B/p41-ARC, ARPC2/p34-ARC, ARPC3/p21-ARC, ARPC4/p20-ARC and ARPC5/p16-ARC.
