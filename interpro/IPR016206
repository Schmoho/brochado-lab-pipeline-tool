{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ketol-acid reductoisomerases (KARI) catalyses two steps in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. The reaction involves an Mg2+ dependent alkyl migration followed by an NADPH-dependent reduction of the 2-keto group. There are two groups of KARI enzymes: class I is a short form found in fungi and most bacteria, and class II is a long form found in plants and certain bacteria (although their sequences differ) [[cite:PUB00034453], [cite:PUB00036035]].
