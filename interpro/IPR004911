{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In humans, GILT (gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase) functions in MHC class II-restricted antigen processing and MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation by reducing disulfide bonds of endocytosed proteins and facilitating their unfolding and optimal degradation [[cite:PUB00083909], [cite:PUB00083906]]. Several other functions of GILT have also been found, for instance, GILT can act as a host factor for Listeria monocytogenes infection and is involved in the maintenance of cellular glutathione (GSH) levels [[cite:PUB00083909]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GILT is characterised by a CXXC motif in the active site and an enzymatic mechanism in which the pair of active site cysteine residues cooperate to reduce substrate disulfide bonds [[cite:PUB00083909]]. The GIL homologues from Drosophila melanogaster may play a role in the innate immune response upon bacterial challenge [[cite:PUB00083905]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nwx", "name" "Structure of mouse GILT, an enzyme involved in antigen processing"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13234" "GAMMA-INTERFERON INDUCIBLE LYSOSOMAL THIOL REDUCTASE GILT"}, "pfam" {"PF03227" "Gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase GILT", "short" "Interferon-induced_GILT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 142, "proteomes" 2255, "taxa" 8175, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8695, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8257, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5393}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004911", :literature {"PUB00083909" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["West LC" "Cresswell P."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
