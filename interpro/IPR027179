{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family adopt a coiled coil structure, with two antiparallel Î±-helices that are tightly strapped together by two disulfide bridges at each end. The protein sequence shows a cysteine motif, required for the stabilisation of the coiled-coil-like structure. Additional inter-helix hydrophobic contacts impart stability to this scaffold [[cite:PUB00024565]].</p>\n\n<p>The precise function of this family is, as yet, unknown [[cite:PUB00013217]]. Cx9C motif-containing protein 4 (CMC4, also known as Mature T-cell proliferation 1 neighbor protein or Mature T-cell proliferation-1 type A) is found in mitochondria.
