{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Tiki1/2 from humans, TraB/PrgY from the gut flora Enterococcus faecalis and gumN from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas. Tiki1 is homologous to TraB/PrgY. They have a pair of widely spaced GX2H motifs and a conserved glutamate. From the structural study, this group of proteins have been identified as an ancient metalloprotease clan with a common protein architecture -cobbled from the folds of the EreA/ChaN/PMT group- that mediates proteolytic activities [[cite:PUB00095434]].</p>\n\n<p>Tiki1 is a membrane-associated protease that inhibits Wnt via the cleavage of its amino terminus, diminishing Wnt's binding to receptors [[cite:PUB00091071]].</p>\n\n<p>TraB/PrgY is an inhibitor peptide that may act as a protease to inactivate the mating pheromone [[cite:PUB00095434]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01963" "TraB/PrgY/gumN family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TraB/PrgY/GumN family", "short" "TraB/PrgY/GumN_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 117, "proteomes" 4584, "taxa" 18855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25230, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24559, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18265}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002816", :literature {"PUB00095434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bazan JF" "Macdonald BT" "He X."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
