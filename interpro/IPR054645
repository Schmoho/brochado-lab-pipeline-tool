{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents heparin and heparin-sulfate lyase (HepB, also known as heparinase II), which cleaves both heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans through a beta-elimination mechanism. It cleaves heparin at alpha-D-GlcNp2S6S(1->4) alpha-L-IdoAp2S and heparan sulfate at alpha-D-GlcNp2Ac(or 2S)6OH(1->4)beta-D-GlcAp [[cite:PUB00016410]]. HepC specifically cleaves heparan sulfate-rich regions of acidic polysaccharides, it does not act on N,O-desulfated glucosamine or N-acetyl-O-sulfated glucosamine linkages. HepC functions in cleaving metazoan heparan sulfate and providing carbon, nitrogen and sulfate sources for microorganisms [[cite:PUB00154826]]. The structure of Heparinase II has been solved [[cite:PUB00040822]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045571" "heparin/heparin-sulfate lyase HepB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Heparin/heparin-sulfate lyase HepB", "short" "HepB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 35, "taxa" 182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 153, "sets" 0, "proteins" 153, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
