{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the CST complex subunit Ten1 homologue from plants and animals [[cite:PUB00067779]]. Even though the protein sequence similarity is very low between budding yeast Ten1 ([interpro:IPR024222]) and animal/plant Ten1, they are evolutionarily related. Ten1 is essential for telomere integrity and it negatively regulates telomerase activity [[cite:PUB00096792]].</p>\n\n<p>Two distinct telomere capping complexes have evolved: CST complex in budding yeast and shelterin complex in vertebrates. Budding yeast CST is composed of Cdc13, Ten1 and Stn1 [[cite:PUB00067779]]. The homologues of Ten1 and Stn1 have been identified in vertebrates and plants. The vertebrate CST complex does not appear to play a primary role in telomere protection, but may complement the function of shelterin complex [[cite:PUB00053884]].</p>\n\n<p>Similar to budding yeast Ten1, mammalian Ten1 forms the CST complex with Stn1 homologue and binds to single strand DNA (ssDNA). However, unlike budding yeast CST, the binding of mammalian CST to ssDNA is not sequence specific. The mammalian CST complex may have both telomeric and non-telomeric functions [[cite:PUB00053884]].</p>\n\n<p>In plants, the CST complex is structurally analogous to mammalian CST and it plays a role in chromosome end protection [[cite:PUB00096792]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33905" "CST COMPLEX SUBUNIT TEN1"}, "pfam" {"PF15490" "Telomere-capping, CST complex subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CST complex subunit Ten1, animal and plant type", "short" "Ten1_animal_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 1074, "taxa" 4003, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1699, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1692, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1126}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029146", :literature {"PUB00053884" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Miyake Y" "Nakamura M" "Nabetani A" "Shimamura S" "Tamura M" "Yonehara S" "Saito M" "Ishikawa F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
