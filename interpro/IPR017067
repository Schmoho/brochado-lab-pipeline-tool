{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1; [ec:3.1.26.4]) from eukaryotes. RNase H1 specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids through endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-phosphomonoester in the presence of magnesium. Human RNase H1 has a DNA-binding channel that, together with the conserved phosphate-binding pocket, confers specificity for the B form and 2'-deoxy form of DNA; the RNA strand is recognised by four consecutive 2'-OH groups and cleaved by a two-metal ion mechanism [[cite:PUB00042692]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the yeasts<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>and<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, this enzyme is named ribonuclease H (RNH1).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vrd", "name" "Crystal structure of RNase H/RNA/PS-ASO complex at an atomic level"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036397", "name" "Ribonuclease H superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012337", "name" "Ribonuclease H-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036852" "Ribonuclease H1, eukaryotic type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease H1, eukaryote", "short" "RNase_H1_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1416, "taxa" 5681, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3464, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2861, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2012}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
