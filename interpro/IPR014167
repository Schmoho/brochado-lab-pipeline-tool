{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are the TolB periplasmic protein of Gram-negative bacteria. TolB is part of the Tol-Pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein) multiprotein complex, comprising five envelope proteins, TolQ, TolR, TolA, TolB and Pal, which form two complexes. The TolQ, TolR and TolA inner-membrane proteins interact via their transmembrane domains. The Î²-propeller domain of the periplasmic protein TolB is responsible for its interaction with Pal. TolB also interacts with the outer-membrane peptidoglycan-associated proteins Lpp and OmpA. TolA undergoes a conformational change in response to changes in the proton-motive force, and interacts with Pal in an energy-dependent manner. The C-terminal periplasmic domain of TolA also interacts with the N-terminal domain of TolB. The Tol-PAL system is required for bacterial outer membrane integrity. Escherichia coli TolB is involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3 and K), and is necessary for the colicins to reach their respective targets after initial binding to the bacteria. It is also involved in uptake of filamentous DNA. Study of its structure suggests that the TolB protein might be involved in the recycling of peptidoglycan or in its covalent linking with lipoproteins. The Tol-Pal system is also implicated in pathogenesis of E. coli, Haemophilus ducreyi, Salmonella enterica and Vibrio cholerae, but the mechanism(s) is unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4pwz", "name" "Crystal structure of TolB protein from Yersinia pestis CO92"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011042", "name" "Six-bladed beta-propeller, TolB-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00671" "Tol-Pal system protein TolB [tolB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02800" "Tol-Pal system beta propeller repeat protein TolB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tol-Pal system protein TolB", "short" "Tol-Pal_TolB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3299, "taxa" 13446, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14747, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14747, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11443}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0542", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0542"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014167", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0017038", "name" "protein import", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0042597", "name" "periplasmic space", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014167", "name" "Tol-Pal system protein TolB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
