{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several proteins (P47 and OrfX cluster) from various Clostridium species [[cite:PUB00019318]] as well as related sequences from other bacteria. P47 and OrfX cluster proteins adopt a complex fold which has an internal structural duplication. They share structural similarity to lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and have been shown to bind to several types of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate (PIP) lipids [[cite:PUB00103915]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ekt", "name" "Structure of P47 from Clostridium botulinum A2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06597" "Clostridium P-47 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Clostridium P47 protein", "short" "Clostridium_P47"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 367, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 381, "sets" 0, "proteins" 374, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010567", :literature {"PUB00103915" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Gustafsson R" "Berntsson RP" "Martinez-Carranza M" "El Tekle G" "Odegrip R" "Johnson EA" "Stenmark P."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Crystal structures of OrfX2 and P47 from a Botulinum neurotoxin OrfX-type gene cluster.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "3781-3792", "volume" "591", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29067689}, "PUB00019318" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Santos-Buelga JA" "Collins MD" "East AK."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
