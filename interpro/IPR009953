{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT) proteins. Members of this family seem to be specific to Rhodospirillum, Rhodobacter and Azospirillum species. Dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyl transferase (DRAT) carries out the transfer of the ADP-ribose from NAD to the Arg-101 residue of one subunit of the dinitrogenase reductase homodimer, resulting in inactivation of that enzyme. Dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase (DRAG) removes the ADP-ribose group attached to dinitrogenase reductase, thus restoring nitrogenase activity. The DRAT-DRAG system negatively regulates nitrogenase activity in response to exogenous NH4+ or energy limitation in the form of a shift to darkness or to anaerobic conditions [[cite:PUB00013113]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07357" "Dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase", "short" "DRA_trans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 239, "taxa" 1015, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 738, "sets" 0, "proteins" 736, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 588}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
