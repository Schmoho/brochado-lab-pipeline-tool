{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA-binding protein E3 from Vaccinia virus (E3L, also known as RNA-binding protein OPG065) is a dsRNA-binding protein capable of inhibiting protein kinase R and is an effective IRF3 and -7 phosphorylation inhibitor [[cite:PUB00078884]]. It inhibits NF-kappa-B activation and the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, which is an early antiviral protein [[cite:PUB00103651], [cite:PUB00103650]]. The C terminus of E3 binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), while the N-terminal Z-nucleic acid binding domain of E3 is required for the additional regulation of eIF2alpha phosphorylation and the recognition and binding of Z-RNA structures. RNA-binding activity is required to escape host ZBP1-dependent necroptosis [[cite:PUB00078885], [cite:PUB00103649], [cite:PUB00103648]].</p>\n\n<p>Protein E3 from Variola virus is also included in this family. It plays a role in the inhibition of multiple cellular antiviral responses activated by dsRNA, such as inhibition of PKR activation, apoptosis, and IFN-mediated antiviral activities [[cite:PUB00100310]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004008" "Interferon resistance/PKR inhibitor, vaccinia E3L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein E3", "short" "E3L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 84, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 261, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009179", :literature {"PUB00078884" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Smith EJ" "Marie I" "Prakash A" "Garcia-Sastre A" "Levy DE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
