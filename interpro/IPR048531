{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Protein ea8.5 from Bacteriophage lambda ([swissprot:P03755]) and similar sequences mostly from tailed bacteriophages and bacterial prophages. It ranges from around 45 to 90 residues in length and is associated with nucleic acid binding function, playing an essential role in the inhibition of the initiation of DNA synthesis in the phage host. NMR analysis shows it adopts a hybrid homeodomain/zinc-finger fold, which suggests a regulatory role [[cite:PUB00151603], [cite:PUB00151604], [cite:PUB00151605]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR048532", "name" "Protein ea8.5-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20735" "Bacteriophage lambda ea8.5-related domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein ea8.5-like", "short" "ea8_5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 238, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 73}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048531", :literature {"PUB00151603" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Kwan JJ" "Smirnova E" "Khazai S" "Evanics F" "Maxwell KL" "Donaldson LW."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "The solution structures of two prophage homologues of the bacteriophage Î» Ea8.5 protein reveal a newly discovered hybrid homeodomain/zinc-finger fold.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "3612-4", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23672713}, "PUB00151604" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Licznerska K" "Dydecka A" "Bloch S" "Topka G" "Nejman-Falenczyk B" "Wegrzyn A" "Wegrzyn G."], "ISO_journal" "Oxid Med Cell Longev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oxid Med Cell Longev", "title" "The Role of the Exo-Xis Region in Oxidative Stress-Mediated Induction of Shiga Toxin-Converting Prophages.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "8453135", "volume" "2016", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26798427}, "PUB00151605" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Tong J" "Nejman-Falenczyk B" "Bloch S" "Wegrzyn A" "Wegrzyn G" "Donaldson LW."], "ISO_journal" "ACS Omega", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "ACS Omega", "title" "Ea22 Proteins from Lambda and Shiga Toxin-Producing Bacteriophages Balance Structural Diversity with Functional Similarity.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "12236-12244", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32548406}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048531", "name" "Protein ea8.5-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 12}}}
