{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting proteins (FHIP, also known as FAM160) found in metazoa and fungi, which are components of the FTS/Hook/FHIP complex (FHF complex). The FHF complex may function to promote vesicle trafficking and/or fusion via the homotypic vesicular protein sorting complex (the HOPS complex). FHF complex promotes the distribution of AP-4 complex to the perinuclear area of the cell [[cite:PUB00097950]]. FHIP2A (FAM160B1) is required for proper functioning of the nervous system [[cite:PUB00097949]]. FHIP2B, previously described as retinoic acid-induced protein 16, is able to activate MAPK/ERK and TGFB signalling pathways and may play a role in cell proliferation [[cite:PUB00097951]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10257" "Retinoic acid induced 16-like protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR21705" "RAI16 PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein", "short" "FHIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 109, "proteomes" 2126, "taxa" 6946, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9229, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8437, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5495}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019384", :literature {"PUB00097950" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Mattera R" "Williamson CD" "Ren X" "Bonifacino JS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "The FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex interacts with AP-4 to mediate perinuclear distribution of AP-4 and its cargo ATG9A.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "963-979", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32073997}, "PUB00097949" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Mavioglu RN" "Kara B" "Akansel G" "Nalbant G" "Tolun A."], "ISO_journal" "Clin Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Clin Genet", "title" "FAM160B1 deficit associated with microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, ataxia, behavioral abnormalities and speech problems.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "456-460", "volume" "96", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31353455}, "PUB00097951" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Wang W" "Zhao LJ" "Yang Y" "Wang RY" "Ren H" "Zhao P" "Zhou WP" "Qi ZT."], "ISO_journal" "Carcinogenesis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Carcinogenesis", "title" "Retinoic acid induced 16 enhances tumorigenesis and serves as a novel tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "2578-85", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22971576}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019384", "name" "FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 19, "alignment:full" 4627}}}
