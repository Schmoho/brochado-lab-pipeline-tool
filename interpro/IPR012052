{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are response regulators/transcription factors that contain CheY-like receiver (phosphoacceptor) domain and a unique DNA-binding domain. Spo0A controls the entry of Bacillus subtilis into the developmental process of sporulation [[cite:PUB00014652]]. Activation of the Spo0A transcription factor by phosphorylation serves as a developmental checkpoint and to integrate several physiological signals that control entry into the sporulation pathway. The signals are generated by conditions of nutrient deprivation, high cell density, the Krebs cycle, DNA replication, DNA damage, and some aspect of the chromosome partitioning machinery [[cite:PUB00014649]].</p>\n\n<p>Activated Spo0A has multiple functions [[cite:PUB00014649]]. It represses promoters (such as the abrB promoter) by binding to sites (0A boxes) downstream from the transcription start site. Spo0A also activates transcription from promoters used by two forms of RNA polymerase that differ by containing either the major sigma factor, sigma A (e.g. the spoIIE and spoIIG promoters) or the alternate sigma factor, sigma H (e.g. the spoIIA promoter). At promoters activated by Spo0A, the 0A boxes lie upstream of the transcription-initiation site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fc3", "name" "THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF TRANS-ACTIVATION DOMAIN OF THE SPORULATION RESPONSE REGULATOR, SPO0A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002937" "Sporulation response regulator, Spo0A type transcription factor"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02875" "sporulation transcription factor Spo0A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation transcription factor Spo0A", "short" "Spore_0_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1209, "taxa" 3927, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4298, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4295, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3159}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012052", :literature {"PUB00014652" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Errington J."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
