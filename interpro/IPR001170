{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the natriuretic peptide receptors (ANP-A, ANP-B and ANP-C) from animals [[cite:PUB00077556], [cite:PUB00077557]] and guanylate cyclases 2G (GUC2G) from rodents. GUC2G is closely related to the natriuretic peptide receptors, but all ligands known to activate other receptors failed to stimulate its enzymic activity [[cite:PUB00077555]].</p>\n\n<p>Natriuretic peptides are hormones involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. These hormones stimulate the intracellular production of cyclic GMP as a second messenger. They belong to a family that includes extracellular ligand binding domains of a wide range of receptors. Three peptide receptors are known, two of which express quanylate cyclase activity (GC-A or ANP-A, and GC-B or ANP-B), while the third (ANP-C) is probably responsible for the clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from the circulation and does not play a role in signal transduction [[cite:PUB00002592], [cite:PUB00001497]].</p>\n\n<p>GC-A and GC-B are plasma membrane-bound proteins that share the following topology: an N-terminal extracellular domain which acts as the ligand binding region, then a transmembrane domain followed by a large cytoplasmic C-terminal region that can be subdivided into two domains: a protein kinase-like domain [interpro:IPR000719] that appears important for proper signalling and a guanylate cyclase catalytic domain [interpro:IPR001054]. The topology of ANP-C is different: like GC-A and -B it possesses an extracellular ligand-binding region and a transmembrane domain, but its cytoplasmic domain is very short.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00458" "Natriuretic peptides receptors signature"}, "prints" {"PR00255" "NATPEPTIDER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylyl cyclase class-4/guanylyl cyclase", "short" "ANPR/GUC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 954, "taxa" 3780, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23206, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5936, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3281}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00430", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00430"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
