{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peptide chain release factors (RFs) are required for the termination of protein biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00004944]]. At present two classes of RFs can be distinguished. Class I RFs bind to ribosomes that have encountered a stop codon at their decoding site and induce release of the nascent polypeptide. Class II RFs are GTP-binding proteins that interact with class I RFs and enhance class I RF activity. In prokaryotes there are two class I RFs that act in a codon specific manner [[cite:PUB00003804]]: RF-1 (gene prfA) mediates UAA and UAG-dependent termination while RF-2 (gene prfB), which is represented by this entry, mediates UAA and UGA-dependent termination.
