{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is the long form of Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase. Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase catalyses the formation of dTDP-glucose, from dTTP and glucose 1-phosphate. It is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, a cell wall constituent and a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00026041]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two forms of Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase in bacteria and archeae, a short form (see [interpro:IPR005907]) and a long form. The homotetrameric short form is found in numerous bacterial species that incorporate dTDP-L-rhamnose, which it helps synthesize, into the cell wall. It is subject to feedback inhibition. The long form, in contrast, is found in many species for which it serves as a sugar-activating enzyme for antibiotic biosynthesis and or other, unknown pathways, and in which dTDP-L-rhamnose is not necessarily produced.  The long from enzymes also have a left-handed parallel helix domain at the C terminus, whereas, the short form enzymes do not have this domain [[cite:PUB00080745], [cite:PUB00025526], [cite:PUB00028942], [cite:PUB00026041], [cite:PUB00021622]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04189" "G1P_TT_long represents the long form of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01208" "glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, long form", "short" "G1P_thy_trans_l"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 767, "taxa" 4114, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4352, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4352, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3234}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0950", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0950"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
