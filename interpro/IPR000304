{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) ([ec:1.5.1.2]) [[cite:PUB00003735], [cite:PUB00001785]] is the enzyme that catalyses the terminal step in the biosynthesis of proline from glutamate, the NAD(P)  dependent oxidation of 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate into proline. This enzyme is also able to convert delta-1-piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C) into pipecolic acid [[cite:PUB00081473]]; this activity is part of pathway for the biosynthesis of the cyclic tetrapeptide apicidin F in the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi [[cite:PUB00081474]]. This entry also includes the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase ucsG from Acremonium sp., which is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of UCS1025A, a member of the pyrrolizidinone family that is a strong telomerase inhibitor and displays potent antibacterial and antitumor properties [[cite:PUB00094509]]. This entry also includes Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase kk1I, part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of KK-1, a novel cyclic depsipeptide with 10 residues which is a promising active compound with high activity against many plant pathogens, especially Botrytis cinerea [[cite:PUB00153734], [cite:PUB00153735]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3gt0", "name" "Crystal structure of pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase from Bacillus cereus.
