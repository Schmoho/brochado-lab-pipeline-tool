{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein A (GbpA) of various pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, which is the etiologic agent of cholera in humans. GbpA binds to chitin and specifically to the chitin monomer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a sugar residue that is also found on the surface of epithelial cells. Intestinal colonization of V. cholerae occurs in a stepwise fashion, initiating with attachment to the small intestinal epithelium [[cite:PUB00056779]]. This attachment is followed by expression of the toxin co-regulated pilus, microcolony formation, and cholera toxin production.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01905" "GlcNAc-binding protein A [gbpA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein A", "short" "GlcNAc-bd_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 167, "sets" 0, "proteins" 167, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 123}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020879", :literature {"PUB00056779" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7069", "authors" ["Kirn TJ" "Jude BA" "Taylor RK."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature04249", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A colonization factor links Vibrio cholerae environmental survival and human infection.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "863-6", "volume" "438", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16341015}, "PUB00053150" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Jude BA" "Martinez RM" "Skorupski K" "Taylor RK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
