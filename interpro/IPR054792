{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small group of short bacterial selenoproteins with a UxxC selenocysteine-containing motif immediately preceded by a signature motif HSGNPX. Most members contain selenocysteine. At least five members are fusion proteins with a C-terminal thioredoxin-disulfide reductase region ([interpro:IPR005982]). Members of this family are given the gene symbol TsoX (Three Selenoprotein Operon protein X), as it occasionally occurs in the same operon as selenoproteins TsoA, TsoB, and TsoC.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045809" "HSGNPxU motif (seleno)protein TsoX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HSGNP motif-containing (seleno)protein TsoX", "short" "TsoX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 125, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054792", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054792", "name" "HSGNP motif-containing (seleno)protein TsoX", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
