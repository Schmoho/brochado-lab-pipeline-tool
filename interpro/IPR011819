{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of proteins restricted to and found as paralogous pairs (typically close together) in species of Pyrococcus, a hyperthermophilic archaeal genus. Members are always found close to other genes of threonine biosynthesis and appear to represent the Pyrococcal form of aspartate kinase. Alignment to aspartokinase III from Escherichia coli shows that 300 N-terminal and 20 C-terminal amino acids are homologous, but the form in Pyrococcus lacks ~100 amino acids in between.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036393", "name" "Acetylglutamate kinase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02078" "putative Pyrococcus aspartate kinase subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyrococcus aspartate kinase subunit, putative", "short" "AspKin_pair"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 45, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49, "sets" 0, "proteins" 49, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0160", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0160"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011819", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR011819", "name" "Pyrococcus aspartate kinase subunit, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
