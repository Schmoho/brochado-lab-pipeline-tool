{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of thiopurine S-methyltransferase proteins from both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyses S-methylation of aromatic and heterocyclic sulphydryl compounds, including anticancer and immunosuppressive thiopurines [[cite:PUB00011488]]. Thiopurine is commonly used to suppress the immune system in the case of autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease and to prevent transplanted organ rejection [[cite:PUB00043377]]. Thiopurine drugs can be toxic to cells but their effect can be mediated by the incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides into DNA [[cite:PUB00043378]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bzg", "name" "Crystal structure of thiopurine S-methyltransferase."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00812" "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase [tpm]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF023956" "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase", "short" "Thiopurine_S-MeTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1420, "taxa" 6516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5234, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4024}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
