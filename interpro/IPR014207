{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit 1 (CyoB) of the cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex, which is a component of the aerobic respiratory chain that reacts with oxygen, reducing it to water with the concomitant transport of 4 protons across the membrane. Also known as the cytochrome bo complex, cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase contains four subunits, two haem B cofactors and a copper atom which is believed to be the oxygen active site. This complex is structurally related to the cytochrome caa3 oxidases which utilise cytochrome c as the reductant and contain haem A cofactors, as well as the intermediate form aa3 oxidases which also react directly with quinones as the reductant.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036927", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase-like, subunit I superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02843" "cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase, subunit I", "short" "Cyt_c_ubiqinol_oxidase_su1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1250, "taxa" 6603, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7336, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7336, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5918}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1641", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1641"} {"accession" "GenProp1563", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1563"} {"accession" "GenProp0618", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0618"} {"accession" "GenProp1401", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1401"} {"accession" "GenProp1164", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1164"} {"accession" "GenProp1367", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1367"} {"accession" "GenProp1493", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1493"} {"accession" "GenProp1751", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1751"} {"accession" "GenProp1256", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1256"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
