{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes ArgK (also known as YgfD) from E. coli, Methylmalonic aciduria type A protein (MMA) from human and similar proteins [[cite:PUB00106871]], which belong to the G3E family of P-loop GTPases, a family defined by the glutamate residue in the Walker B motif and an intact NKxD, members of which include: UreG, HypB, CobW, and MeaB [[cite:PUB00057891]]. These may function as G-protein chaperones that assist AdoCbl cofactor delivery to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and reactivation of the enzyme during catalysis [[cite:PUB00100594], [cite:PUB00054406], [cite:PUB00057891]]</p>\n\n<p>ArgK is involved in the transport of positively charged amino acids (lysine, arginine, and ornithine) and has arginine kinase activity. It is found in a small, but phylogenetically diverse array of bacteria and archaea, and in Caenorhabditis and Leishmania among the eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00013952]]. Although ArgK was characterised as an ATPase originally [[cite:PUB00019162]], it has been shown to bind and cleave GTP. Therefore, its actual substrate in vivo is GTP rather than ATP [[cite:PUB00057891]].</p>\n\n<p>MMA is involved in intracellular vitamin B12 metabolism where it mediates the transport of cobalamin (Cbl) into mitochondria for the final steps of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) synthesis [[cite:PUB00100594], [cite:PUB00054406]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3p32", "name" "Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by an MCM-associated and MeaB- and MMAA-like G-protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00750" "methylmalonyl Co-A mutase-associated GTPase MeaB"}, "panther" {"PTHR23408" "METHYLMALONYL-COA MUTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SIMIBI class G3E GTPase, ArgK/MeaB", "short" "GTPase_ArgK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5230, "taxa" 19026, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22715, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22698, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17015}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
