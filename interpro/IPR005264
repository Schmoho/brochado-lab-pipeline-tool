{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N-acetylneuraminate lyase (or N-Acetylneuraminic acid aldolase, NAL) catalyzes the cleavage of N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) to form pyruvate and N-acetyl-D-mannosamine. The enzyme plays an important role in the regulation of sialic acid metabolism in bacteria.  It has a widespread application as biocatalyst for the synthesis of sialic acid and its derivatives [[cite:PUB00081235]]. This enzyme has been shown to be quite specific for pyruvate as the donor, but flexible to a variety of D-and, to some extent, L-hexoses and pentoses as acceptor substrates. NAL is member of dihydrodipicolinate synthase family that comprises several pyruvate-dependent class I aldolases [[cite:PUB00021758]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1f6k", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE LYASE FROM HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE: CRYSTAL FORM II"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00954" "N-Acetylneuraminic acid aldolase, also called N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NAL)"}, "hamap" {"MF_01237" "N-acetylneuraminate lyase [nanA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00683" "N-acetylneuraminate lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylneuraminate lyase", "short" "NanA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 244, "taxa" 1678, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1450, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1450, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1127}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
