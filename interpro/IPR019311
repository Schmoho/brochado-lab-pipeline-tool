{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a human Ferry endosomal RAB5 effector complex subunit 3 (Fy-3) and similar sequences from animals and some fungal species. \nFy-3 is a component of the FERRY complex (Five-subunit Endosomal Rab5 and RNA/ribosome intermediary), which directly interacts with mRNAs and RAB5A, and functions as a RAB5A effector involved in the localisation and the distribution of specific mRNAs most likely by mediating their endosomal transport. The complex recruits mRNAs and ribosomes to early endosomes through direct mRNA-interaction [[cite:PUB00153730]].\nThis family was previously known as DUF2362.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10154" "Ferry endosomal RAB5 effector complex subunit 3"}, "panther" {"PTHR16525" "PROTEIN C12ORF4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferry endosomal RAB5 effector complex subunit 3", "short" "Fy-3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 1104, "taxa" 4287, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2251, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1408}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019311", :literature {"PUB00153730" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Schuhmacher JS" "Tom Dieck S" "Christoforidis S" "Landerer C" "Davila Gallesio J" "Hersemann L" "Seifert S" "Schafer R" "Giner A" "Toth-Petroczy A" "Kalaidzidis Y" "Bohnsack KE" "Bohnsack MT" "Schuman EM" "Zerial M."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.05.012", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "The Rab5 effector FERRY links early endosomes with mRNA localization.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "1839-1855.e13", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37267905}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019311", "name" "Ferry endosomal RAB5 effector complex subunit 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 11, "alignment:full" 1586}}}
