{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ActR, PrrA, and RegA are examples of lineage-specific names given to a response regulator transcription factor that acts as a global regulator and belongs to a sensor-regulator pair with ActS/PrrB/RegB respectively, that is highly conserved in the alphaproteobacteria. Examples of this regulator include ActR (acid tolerance regulator) in Sinorhizobium meliloti [[cite:PUB00105326]], stationary phase response regulator SpdR in Caulobacter crescentus (also known as C. vibroides) [[cite:PUB00105325]], and RegA, member of the two-component regulatory system RegB/RegA involved in transactivating anaerobic expression of the photosynthetic apparatus [[cite:PUB00105328]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033791" "ActR/PrrA/RegA family redox response regulator transcription factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ActR/PrrA/RegA redox response regulator transcription factor", "short" "ActR_PrrA_rreg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1019, "taxa" 3262, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3194, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2534}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047772", :literature {"PUB00105325" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["da Silva CA" "Lourenco RF" "Mazzon RR" "Ribeiro RA" "Marques MV."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Microbiol", "title" "Transcriptomic analysis of the stationary phase response regulator SpdR in Caulobacter crescentus.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "66", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27072651}, "PUB00105326" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Tang G" "Wang S" "Lu D" "Huang L" "Li N" "Luo L."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiol Res", "title" "Two-component regulatory system ActS/ActR is required for Sinorhizobium meliloti adaptation to oxidative stress.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1-7", "volume" "198", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28285657}, "PUB00105328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Elsen S" "Swem LR" "Swem DL" "Bauer CE."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol Mol Biol Rev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiol Mol Biol Rev", "title" "RegB/RegA, a highly conserved redox-responding global two-component regulatory system.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "263-79", "volume" "68", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15187184}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000160", "name" "phosphorelay signal transduction system", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047772", "name" "ActR/PrrA/RegA redox response regulator transcription factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
