{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Exodeoxyribonuclease V, or RecBCD holoenzyme, ([ec:3.1.11.5]) is a multifunctional nuclease with potent ATP-dependent exodeoxyribonuclease activity. Ejection of RecD, as occurs at chi recombinational hotspots, cripples exonuclease activity in favor of recombinagenic helicase activity. All proteins in this family for which functions are known are DNA-DNA helicases that are used as part of an exonuclease-helicase complex (made up of RecBCD homologues) that function to generate substrates for the initiation of recombination and recombinational repair. The complex catalyses exonucleolytic cleavage in either the 5' to 3' or 3' to 5' direction to yield 5-phosphooligonucleotides in the presence of ATP. This is the beta subunit [[cite:PUB00033616]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01485" "RecBCD enzyme subunit RecB [recB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00609" "exodeoxyribonuclease V subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RecBCD enzyme subunit RecB", "short" "RecB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1874, "taxa" 8964, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9678, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9678, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6997}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0216", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0216"} {"accession" "GenProp1188", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1188"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
