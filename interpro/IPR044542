{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein N(alpha)-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotic cells. This entry includes N-alpha-acetyltransferase 30 (NAA30), also known as Mak3, and related proteins. In budding yeast it's the catalytic subunit of the NatC Nalpha-terminal acetyltransferase [[cite:PUB00009844]]. Human NatC (hNatC) complex also contains the catalytic subunit hMak3 and the auxiliary subunits hMak10 and hMak31 [[cite:PUB00091098]].
