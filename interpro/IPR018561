{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the oxidative stress regulator AosR from Mycobacterium, a transcription factor crucial for intra-mycobacterial redox homeostasis and protection against host-derived oxidative and nitrosative radicals [[cite:PUB00151551]]. In response to oxidative stress, it interacts with the ECF sigma factor SigH and, in conjunction with SigH, binds to an auxiliary promoter upstream of mec-cysO-cysM, leading to the transcriptional activation of these genes encoding a non-canonical actinomycete-specific cysteine biosynthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00151551]]. Increased production of cysteine protects mycobacteria cells from host phagocyte-derived oxidative and nitrosative stress, thus facilitating the mycobacterial growth in the host [[cite:PUB00151551]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09438" "Domain of unknown function (DUF2017)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oxidative stress regulator AosR", "short" "AosR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 1813, "taxa" 5214, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5539, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4314}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018561", :literature {"PUB00151551" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Khan MZ" "Singha B" "Ali MF" "Taunk K" "Rapole S" "Gourinath S" "Nandicoori VK."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020106111", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Redox homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is modulated by a novel actinomycete-specific transcription factor.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e106111", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34018220}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018561", "name" "Oxidative stress regulator AosR", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 62, "alignment:full" 1812}}}
