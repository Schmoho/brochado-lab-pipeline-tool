{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase hydrolyses the non-canonical purine nucleotides inosine triphosphate (ITP), deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) as well as 2'-deoxy-N-6-hydroxylaminopurine triposphate (dHAPTP) and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP) to their respective monophosphate derivatives. The enzyme does not distinguish between the deoxy- and ribose forms. It probably excludes non-canonical purines from RNA and DNA precursor pools, thus preventing their incorporation into RNA and DNA and avoiding chromosomal lesions [[cite:PUB00053239]]. In yeast, it also hydrolyses 5-bromodeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (BrdUTP) [[cite:PUB00064772], [cite:PUB00064770]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2car", "name" "Crystal Structure Of Human Inosine Triphosphatase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029001", "name" "Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03148" "Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase [ITPA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase", "short" "ITPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2289, "taxa" 8034, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3994, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3993, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2468}, "pathways" 29}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
