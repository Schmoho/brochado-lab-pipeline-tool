{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents NifA, a DNA-binding regulatory protein for nitrogen fixation. Not included in this group are: the homologue in Aquifex aeolicus (which lacks nitrogenase), transcriptional activators of alternative nitrogenases (VFe or FeFe instead of MoFe), and truncated forms.</p>\r\n<p>In diazotrophic proteobacteria, the sigma54-dependent activator NifA activates transcription of the nif (nitrogen fixation) genes by a conserved mechanism common to members of the enhancer binding protein family. Although NifA proteins have similar domain structures, both transcriptional regulation of nifA expression and posttranslational regulation of NifA activity by oxygen and fixed nitrogen vary significantly from one organism to another. In Klebsiella pneumoniae and Azotobacter vinelandii, nifA is co-ordinately transcribed with a second gene, nifL, whose product inhibits NifA activity in response to oxygen and fixed nitrogen [[cite:PUB00015127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01817" "nif-specific transcriptional activator NifA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nif-specific regulatory protein", "short" "Nif-specific_regulatory_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 391, "taxa" 2124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1804, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1804, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1479}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010113", :literature {"PUB00015127" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Reyes-Ramirez F" "Little R" "Dixon R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
