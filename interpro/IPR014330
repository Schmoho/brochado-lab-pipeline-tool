{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>YaaA has a single S4 domain ([interpro:IPR002942]). It may be a ribosome maturation protein that its overexpression can restore both the growth and the sporulation defects caused by mutation of rplB, encoding ribosomal protein L2 [[cite:PUB00089807]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The S4 domain may bind RNA. Members of this protein are found almost exclusively in the Firmicutes, and almost invariably just a few nucleotides upstream of the gene for the DNA replication and repair protein RecF. The few members that are not near recF are found instead near dnaA and/or dnaN, the usual neighbours of recF, near the origin of replication. The conserved location suggests a possible role in replication in the Firmicutes lineage.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036986", "name" "RNA-binding S4 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02988" "S4 domain-containing protein YaaA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding S4-related,YaaA", "short" "RNA-bd_S4-rel_YaaA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1038, "taxa" 3841, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3518, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3518, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2801}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014330", :literature {"PUB00089807" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 6", "authors" ["Suzuki S" "Tanigawa O" "Akanuma G" "Nanamiya H" "Kawamura F" "Tagami K" "Nomura N" "Kawabata T" "Sekine Y."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.076463-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Enhanced expression of Bacillus subtilis yaaA can restore both the growth and the sporulation defects caused by mutation of rplB, encoding ribosomal protein L2.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1040-53", "volume" "160", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24637032}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014330", "name" "RNA-binding S4-related,YaaA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
