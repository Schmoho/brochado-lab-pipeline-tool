{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ODF1 is a component of the outer dense fibres (ODF), which are cytoskeletal structures specifically found in the sperm tails of vertebrates. ODF1 has been assigned to the heat shock protein family based on its overall structural features and especially on its conserved alpha-crystallin domain, and it is also known as HSPB10 [[cite:PUB00086853]].
