{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifer protein 2 (SAMP2) is involved in sulfur transfer during molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. SAMP2 has been demonstrated to form covalent conjugates with substrate proteins through an isopeptide linkage via C-terminal di-glycine motif in a streamlined archaeal E1-dependent pathway. SAMP2 also forms homo-conjugates through the intermolecular isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine and the Lys58 side chain, a feature that likely resembles polyubiquitination. This protein adopt a typical ubiquitin-like fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016155", "name" "Molybdopterin synthase/thiamin biosynthesis sulphur carrier, beta-grasp", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR053752", "name" "Small archaeal modifier domain-containing protein", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21965" "Small archaeal modifier protein 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small archaeal modifier protein 2", "short" "SAMP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 176, "taxa" 1174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 983, "sets" 0, "proteins" 983, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 868}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053833", :literature {"PUB00138937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Li Y" "Maciejewski MW" "Martin J" "Jin K" "Zhang Y" "Maupin-Furlow JA" "Hao B."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Crystal structure of the ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifier protein 2 from Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1206-17", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23821306}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053833", "name" "Small archaeal modifier protein 2", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR053834", "name" "Ubiquitin-like small modifier protein 2, halobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 100, "alignment:full" 175}}}
