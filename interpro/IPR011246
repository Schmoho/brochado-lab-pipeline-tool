{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a predicted bifunctional diaminopimelate decarboxylase/aspartate kinase from the Gammaproteobacteria.</p>\r\n<p>Bifunctional enzymes permit the direct channelling of intermediates between catalytic centres involved in consecutive reactions in a pathway, offering an efficient means of directing the flow of catalysis and protecting intermediates from degradation [[cite:PUB00014557]]. Both diaminopimelate decarboxylase and aspartate kinase are involved in lysine biosynthesis in bacteria, which can be synthesized from aspartate via the formation of the intermediate diaminopimelate (DAP), a metabolite that is also involved in peptidoglycan formation [[cite:PUB00014558]]. Aspartate kinase catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to aspartic acid, while diaminopimelate decarboxylase catalyses the conversion of diaminopimelate to lysine.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036459" "Predicted bifunctional diaminopimelate decarboxylase/aspartate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional diaminopimelate decarboxylase/aspartate kinase", "short" "DAP_dec_asp_kin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 171, "taxa" 716, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 685, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 505}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011246", :literature {"PUB00014557" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Nagradova N."], "ISO_journal" "IUBMB Life", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15216540310001602805", "medline_journal" "IUBMB Life", "title" "Interdomain communications in bifunctional enzymes: how are different activities coordinated?", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "459-66", "volume" "55", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14609201}, "PUB00014558" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Scapin G" "Blanchard JS."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
