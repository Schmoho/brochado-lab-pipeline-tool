{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ApbA, the ketopantoate reductase enzyme [ec:1.1.1.169] of Salmonella typhimurium is required for the synthesis of thiamine via the alternative pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway [[cite:PUB00020970]]. Precursors to the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine are synthesized de novo by the purine biosynthetic pathway or the alternative pyrimidine biosynthetic (APB) pathway. The ApbA protein catalyzes the NADPH-specific reduction of ketopantoic acid to pantoic acid. This activity had previously been associated with the pantothenate biosynthetic gene panE [[cite:PUB00020974]]. ApbA and PanE are allelic [[cite:PUB00020974]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also include budding yeast Pan5, which is a 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase involved in the (R)-pantothenate biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00086634]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ks9", "name" "Ketopantoate Reductase from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00745" "2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ketopantoate reductase ApbA/PanE", "short" "ApbA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5778, "taxa" 23652, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37013, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37013, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27649}, "pathways" 148}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0124", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0124"} {"accession" "GenProp1748", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1748"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
