They may be toxic but also may be used as sources of phosphorus and energy by various bacteria. Phosphonate utilization systems typically are encoded in 14 or more genes, including a three gene ABC transporter. This family includes the periplasmic binding protein component of ABC transporters for phosphonates [[cite:PUB00042957]] as well as other, related binding components for closely related substances such as phosphate [[cite:PUB00043018]] and phosphite. A subset of this entry in which nearly all members exhibit genomic context with elements of phosphonate metabolism, particularly the C-P lyase system (GenProp0232, [[cite:PUB00043019]]) is shown in ([interpro:IPR017797]).
