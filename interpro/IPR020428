{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent a group of atypical dual-specificity phosphatases from plant and fungi. Proteins in this entry include Siw14 and related proteins [[cite:PUB00088172]]. Siw14 is a inositol pyrophosphate phosphatase that modulates inositol pyrophosphate metabolism by dephosphorylating the IP7isoform 5PP-IP5to IP6 [[cite:PUB00088170]]. This entry also includes DSP1/2/3/4/5 from Arabidopsis. All DSPs tested (AtPFA-DSP1,  -2,  -3,  and  -5) displayed phosphatase activity toward PI(3,5)P2, with AtPFA-DSP2 showing a higher activity [[cite:PUB00088172]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029021", "name" "Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01911" "Plant and fungal dual specificity phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Atypical dual-specificity phosphatase Siw14-like, plant and fungi", "short" "PFA-DSPs"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 794, "taxa" 2766, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12667, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3648, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2385}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
