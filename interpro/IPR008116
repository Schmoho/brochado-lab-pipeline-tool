{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The sequence-specific single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSDP) family is thought to be involved in transciption regulation. SSDP specifically binds single-stranded pyrimidine-rich mirror repeat elements commonly found in promoter regions, and is believed to regulate alpha-2(I) collagen [[cite:PUB00010325]]. It has been identified as a target for unbalanced translocations and deletions in acute myelogenous leukemia cells, implying a role as a tumour suppressor gene. It is expressed in spleen, lymph node, peripheral blood, bone marrow, thymus and foetal liver. Family members have been identified in chicken, human, rat, mouse and Drosophila. The highest sequence identity is observed in the first 100 N-terminal residues, which contains a tryptophan-rich region in its centre. The C terminus is more viariable, with glycine/ proline-rich low complexity regions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6iwv", "name" "Crystal structure of a single strand DNA binding protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01743" "SSDNABINDING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sequence-specific single-strand DNA-binding protein", "short" "SSDP_DNA-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 782, "taxa" 3346, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24604, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5307, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3004}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008116", :literature {"PUB00010325" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Bayarsaihan D" "Soto RJ" "Lukens LN."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
