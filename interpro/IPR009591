P6 is a small protein (6kDa) localised in the endoplasmic reticulum. It has a single-span N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal hydrophilic domain which faces the cytosol. It is involved, together with Hsp70h, CP, CPm, and P64, in cell to cell movement of the viral genome without any budding, being essential for this process. The mechanism of action of this protein is not clear.
