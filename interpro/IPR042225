{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes budding yeast Ncb2 and its homologues. Ncb2 is a component of the NC2 complex which represses RNA polymerase II transcription through binding to Spt15/TBP and thereby inhibiting the assembly of the preinitiation complex [[cite:PUB00062943]]. Its human homologue, DR1, associates with DRAP1 through histone fold motifs to form the NC2 complex, which negatively regulates transcription initiation [[cite:PUB00060941]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes proteins from fungi, such as NctB from Neosartorya fumigata and Ncb2 from Candida albicans. NctB forms a complex with NctA, and this complex acts as a general transcriptional cofactor [[cite:PUB00093952]].  In Candida albicans, conditional Ncb2 null mutants have been shown to display decreased susceptibility toward azole and an enhanced transcription of CDR1 [[cite:PUB00093953]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009072", "name" "Histone-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46138" "PROTEIN DR1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Negative cofactor 2 complex subunit beta", "short" "Ncb2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2201, "taxa" 7321, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3188, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3188, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2118}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042225", :literature {"PUB00062943" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Cang Y" "Prelich G."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
