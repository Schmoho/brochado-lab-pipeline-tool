{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diphosphate--fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase catalyses the addition of phosphate from diphosphate (PPi) to fructose 6-phosphate to give fructose 1,6-bisphosphate ([ec:2.7.1.90]). The enzyme is also known as pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase. The usage of PPi-dependent enzymes in glycolysis presumably frees up ATP for other processes [[cite:PUB00014390]]. [interpro:IPR012828] represents the ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase enzyme contained within Phosphofructokinase. This entry contains primarily bacterial, plant alpha, and plant beta sequences. These may be dimeric nonallosteric enzymes (bacteria) or allosteric heterotetramers (plants) [[cite:PUB00014411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035966", "name" "Phosphofructokinase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02477" "diphosphate--fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005677" "Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, PfpB type"}, "hamap" {"MF_01980" "Pyrophosphate--fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase [pfp]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase PfpB", "short" "PfpB_PPi_PFK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 625, "taxa" 2843, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3333, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2145}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
