{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\n\n<p>Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis, resulting in increased production of platelets, as well as activating osteoclasts, inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and inhibiting macrophage mediator production. These functions may be particularly important in mediating the hematopoietic, osseous and mucosal protective effects of IL-11 [[cite:PUB00013131]]. The cytokine also possesses anti-inflammatory activity, and has been proposed as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis [[cite:PUB00046036]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents interleukin-11.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8dpv", "name" "The crystal structure of Interleukin-11, W147A mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16922" "INTERLEUKIN 11"}, "pfam" {"PF07400" "Interleukin 11"}, "prints" {"PR01927" "Interleukin-11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-11", "short" "IL-11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 290, "taxa" 1195, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 674, "sets" 0, "proteins" 652, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 393}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020438", :literature {"PUB00013131" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8-9", "authors" ["Leng SX" "Elias JA."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
