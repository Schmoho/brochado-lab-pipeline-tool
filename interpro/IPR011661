{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The crystal structure of the sulphur oxygenase/reductase (SOR) of the thermo-acidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens has been determined to 1.7-A resolution [[cite:PUB00027805]]. Twenty-four monomers form a large hollow sphere enclosing a positively charged nanocompartment. Apolar channels provide access for linear sulphur species. A cysteine persulphide and a low-potential mononuclear non-heme iron site ligated by a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad in a pocket of each subunit constitute the active sites, accessible from the inside of the sphere. The iron is likely the site of both sulphur oxidation and sulphur reduction.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At 85 degrees C<i>in vitro</i>, elemental sulphur is oxidised to sulphite, thiosulphate and hydrogen sulphide with no external cofactors needed. The proposed equation is:  4S + O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O ---> 2 HSO3- + 2 H2S + 2 H<sup>+</sup>.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6qjc", "name" "Dimethyl disulfide inhibited sulfur oxygenase reductase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07682" "Sulphur oxygenase reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphur oxygenase reductase", "short" "S_Oase_red"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 250, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 135, "sets" 0, "proteins" 135, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 108}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
