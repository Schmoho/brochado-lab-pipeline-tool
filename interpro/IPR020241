{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Subunit Pop7 is a component of ribonuclease P, a protein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends. It is also a component of RNase MRP, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences [[cite:PUB00046121], [cite:PUB00045988]]. In yeasts, RNase P consists of an RNA moiety and at least 9 protein subunits including Pop1, Pop3, Pop4, Pop5, Pop6, Pop7, Pop8, Rpp1 and Rpp2. The RNase MRP complex consists of an RNA moiety and at least 10 protein subunits including Pop1, Pop3, Pop4, Pop5, Pop6, Pop7, Pop8, Rmp1, Rpp1 and Snm1, many of which are shared with the RNase P complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036882", "name" "Alba-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28256" "RIBONUCLEASES P/MRP PROTEIN SUBUNIT POP7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease P/MRP subunit Pop7, fungi", "short" "RNase_P/MRP_Pop7_fungi"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 735, "taxa" 1928, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1092, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1092, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 712}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
