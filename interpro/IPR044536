{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peroxisomal proteins catalyse metabolic reactions. The import of proteins from the cytosol into the peroxisomes matrix depends on more than a dozen peroxin (PEX) proteins, among which PEX5 and PEX7 serve as receptors that shuttle proteins bearing one of two peroxisome-targeting signals (PTSs) into the organelle. PEX5 is the PTS1 receptor, while PEX7 is the PTS2 receptor. In plants, PEX7 depends on PEX5 binding to deliver PTS2 cargo into the peroxisome, and PEX7 also facilitates PEX5 accumulation and import of PTS1 cargo into peroxisomes [[cite:PUB00096373], [cite:PUB00096372]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents PEX7 from animals, fungi and plants.
