{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Intermediate filaments (IF) [[cite:PUB00004976], [cite:PUB00000058], [cite:PUB00001053]] are proteins which are primordial components of the cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope. All IF proteins are structurally similar in that they consist of: a central rod domain comprising some 300 to 350 residues which is arranged in coiled-coiled Î±-helices, with at least two short characteristic interruptions; a N-terminal non-helical domain (head) of variable length; and a C-terminal domain (tail) which is also non-helical, and which shows extreme length variation between different IF proteins. While IF proteins are evolutionary and structurally related, they have limited sequence homologies except in several regions of the rod domain.</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents a family of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins of invertebrates, and includes both A and B types [[cite:PUB00059259], [cite:PUB00059260]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005546" "Intermediate filament protein, ifb-2 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intermediate filament, ifa/ifb", "short" "Intermed_filament_ifa/ifb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 104, "taxa" 460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 553, "sets" 0, "proteins" 508, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 337}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016451", :literature {"PUB00059259" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Weber K" "Plessmann U" "Ulrich W."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins of invertebrates are closer to nuclear lamins than are vertebrate intermediate filament proteins; sequence characterization of two muscle proteins of a nematode.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "3221-7", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2583097}, "PUB00059260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Karabinos A" "Schmidt H" "Harborth J" "Schnabel R" "Weber K."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
