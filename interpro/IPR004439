{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) ([ec:1.1.1.42]) can be classified into two types on the basis of their subunit structure. One is a homodimer, consisting of subunits of about 40-45kDa, which exists in many bacterial species, including Escherichia coli. The other is a monomer with a molecular mass of 80-100kDa, which has been reported in several bacteria, including Azotobacter vinelandii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Although bacterial monomeric and dimeric IDHs catalyse the same reaction, homology of amino acid sequence is hardly found between both types of IDHs [[cite:PUB00055420]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pb1", "name" "A four location model to explain the stereospecificity of proteins."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43504" "ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE [NADP]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00183" "isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+))"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isocitrate dehydrogenase NADP-dependent, dimeric, prokaryotic", "short" "Isocitrate_DH_NADP_dimer_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 48, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2774, "taxa" 13953, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17123, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17123, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13328}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1267", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1267"} {"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
