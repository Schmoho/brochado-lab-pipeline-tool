{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Subunit RPB6/RPABC2 is a common component of eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors, mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs, and small RNAs, respectively. In RNA polymerase II (Pol II), RPB6/RPABC2 is part of the clamp element and together with parts of RPB1 and RPB2 forms a pocket to which the RPB4-RPB7 subcomplex binds [[cite:PUB00068177]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to RNA polymerases I, II, and III, the essential RNA polymerases present in all eukaryotes, plants have two additional nuclear RNA polymerases, abbreviated as Pol IV and Pol V, that play nonredundant roles in siRNA-directed DNA methylation and gene silencing. Pol IV and Pol V are composed of subunits that are paralogous or identical to the 12 subunits of Pol II, including subunit RPB6 [[cite:PUB00068178]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036161", "name" "RPB6/omega subunit-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500154" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, RPB6 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, subunit RPB6", "short" "RPB6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 442, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2152, "taxa" 7676, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3573, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3538, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2278}, "pathways" 214}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028363", :literature {"PUB00068177" {"URL" nil, "issue" "51", "authors" ["Kershnar E" "Wu SY" "Chiang CM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
