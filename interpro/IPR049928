{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Type III secretion system effector XopP and related proteins found in beta- and gammaproteobacteria. XopP is a highly conserved core-effector protein produced by X. campestris, the causal agent of black rot disease of crucifers such as Brassica spp., radish, and turnip. This protein is essential for virulence and  inhibits the function of the host-plant exocyst complex by direct targeting of Exo70B, a subunit of the exocyst complex, which plays a significant role in plant immunity [[cite:PUB00106354]]. XopP interferes with exocyst-dependent exocytosis and efficiently inhibits the host's pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity [[cite:PUB00106354], [cite:PUB00106353]]</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041354" "type III secretion system effector XopP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system effector XopP-like", "short" "XopP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 81, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 78}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049928", :literature {"PUB00106353" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ishikawa K" "Yamaguchi K" "Sakamoto K" "Yoshimura S" "Inoue K" "Tsuge S" "Kojima C" "Kawasaki T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Bacterial effector modulation of host E3 ligase activity suppresses PAMP-triggered immunity in rice.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "5430", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25388636}, "PUB00106354" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Michalopoulou VA" "Mermigka G" "Kotsaridis K" "Mentzelopoulou A" "Celie PHN" "Moschou PN" "Jones JDG" "Sarris PF."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The host exocyst complex is targeted by a conserved bacterial type-III effector that promotes virulence.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "3400-3424", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35640532}, "PUB00106343" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["White FF" "Potnis N" "Jones JB" "Koebnik R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Plant Pathol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Plant Pathol", "title" "The type III effectors of Xanthomonas.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "749-66", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19849782}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049928", "name" "Type III secretion system effector XopP-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
