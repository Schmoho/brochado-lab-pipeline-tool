{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1 (BABAM1, also known as MERIT40 and NBA1) was initially identified as a gene required for resistance to ionizing radiation [[cite:PUB00054088]]. It is a component of the BRCA1-A complex, which also contains Brca1/Bard1, Abra1, RAP80, BRCC36, and BRE [[cite:PUB00054088]]. The BRCA1-A complex recognises 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions sites, leading to target the brca1-bard1 heterodimer to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs), facilitating DNA damage repair. The BRCA1-A complex is also involved in G2/M transition DNA damage checkpoint control. BABAM1 may also play a role as a component of the BRISC complex (contains the FAM175B/ABRO1, BRCC3/BRCC36, BRE/BRCC45 and MERIT40/NBA1 proteins), a multiprotein complex that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin. In these 2 complexes, BABAM1 is probably required to maintain the stability of BRE/BRCC45 and help the 'Lys-63'-linked deubiquitinase activity mediated by BRCC3/BRCC36 component [[cite:PUB00060076], [cite:PUB00060688]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15660" "BRISC AND BRCA1-A COMPLEX MEMBER 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1", "short" "BABAM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 941, "taxa" 3885, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1763, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1763, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1119}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026126", :literature {"PUB00060688" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Shao G" "Patterson-Fortin J" "Messick TE" "Feng D" "Shanbhag N" "Wang Y" "Greenberg RA."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1739609", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "MERIT40 controls BRCA1-Rap80 complex integrity and recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "740-54", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19261746}, "PUB00054088" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wang B" "Hurov K" "Hofmann K" "Elledge SJ."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1770309", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "NBA1, a new player in the Brca1 A complex, is required for DNA damage resistance and checkpoint control.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "729-39", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19261749}, "PUB00060076" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Feng L" "Huang J" "Chen J."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1770609", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "MERIT40 facilitates BRCA1 localization and DNA damage repair.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "719-28", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19261748}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045739", "name" "positive regulation of DNA repair", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0070531", "name" "BRCA1-A complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0070552", "name" "BRISC complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026126", "name" "BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
