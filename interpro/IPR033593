{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Ras association domain (RASSF) proteins are named due to the presence of a Ras association (RA) domain in their N or C terminus that can potentially interact with the Ras GTPase family of proteins. These GTPases control a variety of cellular processes, such as membrane trafficking, apoptosis, and proliferation. RASSF proteins contain several other functional domains that modulate associations with other proteins. RASSF proteins with the RA domain at the C terminus (which are termed C-terminal or classical RASSF) usually also include a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain involved in several protein-protein interactions and for homo- and heterodimerisation of RASSF isoforms. N-terminal RASSF proteins (with the RA domain in the N terminus) do not usually contain a SARAH domain [[cite:PUB00079301]].</p>\n\n<p>At least 10 RASSF family members have been characterised (with multiple splice variants), many of which have been shown to play a role in tumour suppression. RASSF proteins also act as scaffolding agents in microtubule stability, regulate mitotic cell division, control cell migration and cell adhesion, and modulate NF-KB activity and the duration of inflammation. Loss of RASSF expression through promoter methylation has been shown in numerous types of cancer, including leukemia, melanoma, breast and prostate cancer [[cite:PUB00079218]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry refers to the N-terminal RASSF family of proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15286" "RAS-ASSOCIATING DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-terminal RASSF family", "short" "N-RASSF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 990, "taxa" 3912, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5099, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5099, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3304}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033593", :literature {"PUB00079218" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Volodko N" "Gordon M" "Salla M" "Ghazaleh HA" "Baksh S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.041", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "RASSF tumor suppressor gene family: biological functions and regulation.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "2671-84", "volume" "588", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24607545}, "PUB00079301" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Chan JJ" "Flatters D" "Rodrigues-Lima F" "Yan J" "Thalassinos K" "Katan M."], "ISO_journal" "Adv Biol Regul", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbior.2012.12.001", "medline_journal" "Adv Biol Regul", "title" "Comparative analysis of interactions of RASSF1-10.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "190-201", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23357313}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR033593", "name" "N-terminal RASSF family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
