{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein family of phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthases (SAICAR synthetase or PUR7), significantly different in sequence from ([interpro:IPR001636]), which is predominantly found in the gammaproteobacteria Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella, Colwellia, and also in the primitive eukaryote Guillardia theta (Cryptomonas phi). This enzyme catalyses the seventh step in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway; the ATP-dependent conversion of 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxylic acid and aspartic acid to SAICAR [[cite:PUB00004940], [cite:PUB00070198]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02735" "phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase, Vibrio-type", "short" "SAICAR_synthase_Vibrio-typ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 251, "taxa" 1196, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1057, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 790}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0110", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0110"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
