{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These sequences, from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, represent the alpha subunit of the holoenzyme citrate lyase composed of alpha ([ec:2.8.3.10]), beta, and acyl carrier protein subunits in a stoichiometric relationship of 6:6:6. Citrate lyase is an enzyme which converts citrate to oxaloacetate. In bacteria, this reaction is involved in citrate fermentation. The alpha subunit catalyzes the reaction Acetyl-CoA + citrate = acetate + (3S)-citryl-CoA. The proteins from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (Streptococcus lactis) [[cite:PUB00009735]] and Klebsiella pneumoniae has been experimentally characterised [[cite:PUB00014613]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037171", "name" "NagB/RpiA transferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40596" "CITRATE LYASE ALPHA CHAIN"}, "pfam" {"PF04223" "Citrate lyase, alpha subunit (CitF)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009451" "Citrate lyase, alpha subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01584" "citrate lyase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate lyase, alpha subunit", "short" "Citrate_lyase_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 596, "taxa" 3809, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4961, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3971}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0672"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
