{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase ([ec:1.4.3.5]) is an enzyme that is involved in the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and pyridoxal phosphate. It oxidizes pyridoxamine-5-P (PMP) and pyridoxine-5-P (PNP) to pyridoxal-5-P. The enzyme requires the presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor, although there is some evidence that coenzyme F420 may perform this role in some species [[cite:PUB00055044]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents a subfamily of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidases, mainly from species that lack the capability to synthesize F420. Family members therefore most likely bind FMN.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012349", "name" "FMN-binding split barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04025" "MSMEG_1061 family FMN-dependent PPOX-type flavoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyridoxamine 5-phosphate oxidase, FMN-dependent", "short" "Pyridox_Oxase_FMN-dep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1892, "taxa" 6956, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8256, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8256, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6461}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024029", :literature {"PUB00055044" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Selengut JD" "Haft DH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
