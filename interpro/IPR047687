{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of bacterial isomerases, including OMA isomerases (also known as 4-oxalomesaconate tautomerase GalD in Pseudomonas putida and LigU from Sphingomonas sp. (strain KA1)). GalD catalyses the tautomerization of the 4-oxalomesaconic acid keto (OMAketo) generated by GalA dioxygenase to 4-oxalomesaconic acid enol (OMAenol) [[cite:PUB00084659]] and mediates the second step in gallate degradation pathway. LigU contributes to the degradation of lignin at the level of the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway. It catalyses the isomerization of the double bond between C4 and C5 in (4E)-oxalomesaconate (OMA) to (3Z)-2-keto-4-carboxy-3-hexenedioate (KCH), where the double bond has migrated between C3 and C4 via a 1,3-allylic isomerization [[cite:PUB00151016]]. The uncharacterised isomerase YbhH from E. coli is also a member of this entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6p3h", "name" "Crystal structure of LigU(K66M) bound to substrate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033377" "4-oxalomesaconate tautomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-oxalomesaconate tautomerase-like", "short" "OMA_tautomer-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1000, "taxa" 4392, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4167, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4167, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3062}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
