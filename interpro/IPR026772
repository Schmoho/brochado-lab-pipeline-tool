{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fin bud initiation factor (Fibin) forms disulfide-linked homodimers. It seems to also exist as monomers [[cite:PUB00061775]]. It localises in endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus [[cite:PUB00061776], [cite:PUB00061775]]. In zebrafish, Fibin is essential for the initiation of pectoral fin bud formation. It potentially acts downstream of retinoic acid and Wnt signaling and is required for tbx5 expression in the lateral plate mesoderm of presumptive pectoral fin bud regions [[cite:PUB00061776]]. In mammals is expressed in cerebellum, skeletal muscle and other embryonic and adult tissues, suggesting a relevant role during embryogenesis and adult life [[cite:PUB00061775]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15819" "Fin bud initiation factor homologue"}, "panther" {"PTHR31185" "FIN BUD INITIATION FACTOR FIBIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fin bud initiation factor", "short" "Fibin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 520, "taxa" 1862, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 810, "sets" 0, "proteins" 783, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 536}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026772", :literature {"PUB00061775" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lakner J" "Seyer C" "Hermsdorf T" "Schoneberg T."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biochem.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2091-12-26", "medline_journal" "BMC Biochem", "title" "Characterization of the expression, promoter activity and molecular architecture of fibin.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "26", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21615908}, "PUB00061776" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wakahara T" "Kusu N" "Yamauchi H" "Kimura I" "Konishi M" "Miyake A" "Itoh N."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
