{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The essential enzyme dUTP pyrophosphatase ([ec:3.6.1.23], dUTPase) is specific for dUTP and is critical for the fidelity of DNA replication and repair. dUTPase hydrolyzes dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, simultaneously reducing dUTP levels and providing the dUMP for dTTP biosynthesis. dUTPase decreases the intracellular concentration of dUPT so that uracil cannot be incorporated into DNA [[cite:PUB00005269]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of human dUTPase reveals that each subunit of the dUTPase trimer folds into an eight-stranded jelly-roll β-barrel, with the C-terminal β-strands interchanged among the subunits. The structure is similar to that of the Escherichia coli enzyme, despite low sequence homology between the two enzymes [[cite:PUB00005269]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8qky", "name" "Bacteriophage T5 dUTPase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036157", "name" "dUTPase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00116" "Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase [dut]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00576" "dUTP diphosphatase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11241" "DEOXYURIDINE 5'-TRIPHOSPHATE NUCLEOTIDOHYDROLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase", "short" "dUTPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 122, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10625, "taxa" 40782, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43141, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43071, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30519}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1617"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
