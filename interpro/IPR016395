{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3 (UL11) is conserved throughout the herpesvirus family. It is a membrane-associated tegument protein that is incorporated into the HSV virion. UL11 and UL51, either singly or in combination, are involved in virion envelopment and/or egress. Both proteins are fatty acylated. UL11 is both acylated by myristoic and palmitoic acids while UL51 is mono-acylated by palmitoic acid [[cite:PUB00045941], [cite:PUB00100124], [cite:PUB00100121], [cite:PUB00100123]].].</p>\n\n<p>UL11 participates also in viral entry at the fusion step probably by regulating the core fusion machinery [[cite:PUB00100122]]. It binds to either to gE or gI, promote the transport of virus particles in neuronal axons [[cite:PUB00100120]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003496" "Myristoylated tegument protein UL11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3, Simplexvirus", "short" "UL11_simplexvirus"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 31, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016395", :literature {"PUB00045941" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Koshizuka T" "Kawaguchi Y" "Nozawa N" "Mori I" "Nishiyama Y."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Genes", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-007-0156-2", "medline_journal" "Virus Genes", "title" "Herpes simplex virus protein UL11 but not UL51 is associated with lipid rafts.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "571-5", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17694428}, "PUB00100123" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Han J" "Chadha P" "Starkey JL" "Wills JW."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Function of glycoprotein E of herpes simplex virus requires coordinated assembly of three tegument proteins on its cytoplasmic tail.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "19798-803", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23150560}, "PUB00100120" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["DuRaine G" "Wisner TW" "Johnson DC."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Characterization of the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Tegument Proteins That Bind to gE/gI and US9, Which Promote Assembly of HSV and Transport into Neuronal Axons.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "94", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32938770}, "PUB00100124" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Baines JD" "Roizman B."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "The UL11 gene of herpes simplex virus 1 encodes a function that facilitates nucleocapsid envelopment and egress from cells.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "5168-74", "volume" "66", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1321297}, "PUB00100121" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Loomis JS" "Courtney RJ" "Wills JW."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Packaging determinants in the UL11 tegument protein of herpes simplex virus type 1.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "10534-41", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16928743}, "PUB00100122" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Kim IJ" "Chouljenko VN" "Walker JD" "Kousoulas KG."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein M and the membrane-associated protein UL11 are required for virus-induced cell fusion and efficient virus entry.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "8029-37", "volume" "87", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23678175}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009653", "name" "anatomical structure morphogenesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019033", "name" "viral tegument", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024351", "name" "Tegument protein UL11, Herpesvirus", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016395", "name" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3, Simplexvirus", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
