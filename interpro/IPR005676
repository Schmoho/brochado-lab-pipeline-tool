Based on sequence alignments, the aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase family appears to have at least three distinct subfamilies. Most studies have been performed on enzymes isolated from Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00034673], [cite:PUB00029242], [cite:PUB00029661], [cite:PUB00034674]]. The N-terminal domain forms the active site and NADP-binding pocket, while C-terminal domain is primarily involved in hydrophobic intersubunit contacts. The catalytic mechanism involves the formation of a covalent thioester acyl-enzyme intermediate mediated through nucleophilic attack by an active site cysteine residue on the substrate aspartyl phosphate. Release of inorganic phosphate is followed by hydride transfer from NADPH to yield the product. The recently described archaeal structure suggests that the two subgroups of aspartate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase share similar structures and have an identical catalytic mechanism, despite their relatively low sequence identity [[cite:PUB00034675]]. Unlike the bacterial enzymes, the archaeal enzyme utilised both NAD and NADP as cofactor.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4dpl", "name" "Structure of malonyl-coenzyme A reductase from crenarchaeota in complex with NadP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00978" "aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, peptidoglycan lacking", "short" "Asp_semi-ald_DH_pep-lack"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2144, "taxa" 8266, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7526, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7526, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5589}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0160", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0160"} {"accession" "GenProp1553", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1553"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
