{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The proteins in this family are functionally uncharacterised. The proteins are around 450 amino acids long and includes Streptococcus pneumoniae Sp0239 ([swissprot:Q97ST4]) and similar uncharacterized proteins. Sp0239 is structurally similar to ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), which are believed to have diverged from a common ancestor. RNR and PFL possess a ten-stranded α/β barrel domain that hosts the active site, and are radical enzymes. RNRs are found in all organisms and provide the only mechanism by which nucleotides are converted to deoxynucleotides. PFL is an essential enzyme in anaerobic bacteria that catalyses the conversion of pyruvate and CoA to acteylCoA and formate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08025" "Uncharacterized proteins with similarity to Ribonucleotide reductase and Pyruvate formate lyase"}, "pfam" {"PF05167" "Uncharacterised ACR (DUF711)"}, "panther" {"PTHR37560" "UPF0210 PROTEIN SPR0218"}, "hamap" {"MF_01221" "UPF0210 protein <locus_tag>"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0210", "short" "UPF0210"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 1603, "taxa" 7439, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7861, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7854, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6025}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007841", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007841", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0210", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR014537", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP027893", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 123, "alignment:full" 1700}}}
