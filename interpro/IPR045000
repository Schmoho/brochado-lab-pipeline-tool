{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of tropinone reductase-like short-chain dehydrogenases (SDRs) from bacteria and plants. This entry includes tropinone reductase 1/2 (TR1/2) from Datura stramonium (Common thornapple). TR1 catalyses the stereospecific reduction of tropinone to tropine [[cite:PUB00097695]]. The Arabidopsis thaliana homologues show high sequence similarity, but do not reduce tropinone [[cite:PUB00097696]]. One of the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue, SAG13 (At2g29350), has been shown to reduce small lipophilic ketones and several monoterpene ketones [[cite:PUB00097698]]. This entry also includes noroxomaritidine/norcraugsodine reductase (NR) rom Narcissus aff. pseudonarcissus MK-2014 (Daffodil). NR catalyses the conversion of noroxomaritidine to oxomaritidine, a precursor of haemanthamine- and crinamine-type alkaloids, promising anticancer agents [[cite:PUB00097697]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5fff", "name" "Noroxomaritidine/Norcraugsodine Reductase in complex with NADP+ and piperonal"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42898" "TROPINONE REDUCTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tropinone reductase", "short" "TR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 605, "taxa" 2960, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6570, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6570, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3995}, "pathways" 150}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
