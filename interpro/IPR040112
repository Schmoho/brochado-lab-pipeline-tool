{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents WetA and related proteins mostly from fungi. BrlA, abaA and wetA are pivotal regulators of conidiophore development and conidium maturation. They act individually and together to regulate their own expression and that of numerous other sporulation-specific genes [[cite:PUB00090538]]. WetA is responsible for activating a set of genes whose products make up the final two conidial wall layers or direct their assembly and, through this activity, is responsible for acquisition of spore dormancy [[cite:PUB00090539], [cite:PUB00090540], [cite:PUB00090541]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22934" "PROTEIN ESC1/WETA-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Developmental regulatory protein WetA", "short" "WetA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 557, "taxa" 1614, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1236, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1236, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 679}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040112", :literature {"PUB00090538" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Mirabito PM" "Adams TH" "Timberlake WE."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(89)90800-3", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Interactions of three sequentially expressed genes control temporal and spatial specificity in Aspergillus development.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "859-68", "volume" "57", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2655931}, "PUB00090539" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Marshall MA" "Timberlake WE."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
