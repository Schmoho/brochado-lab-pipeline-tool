{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) sequences. LEAP-2 is a cysteine-rich, and cationic protein. LEAP-2 contains a core structure with two disulphide bonds formed by cysteine residues in relative 1-3 and 2-4 positions. LEAP-2 is synthesised as a 77-residue precursor, which is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly conserved among mammals. The largest native LEAP-2 form of 40 amino acid residues is generated from the precursor at a putative cleavage site for a furin-like endoprotease. In contrast to smaller LEAP-2 variants, this peptide exhibits dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against selected microbial model organisms [[cite:PUB00013114]]. The exact function of this family is unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07359" "Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 precursor (LEAP-2)"}, "panther" {"PTHR21007" "LIVER EXPRESSED ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2", "short" "LEAP-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 494, "taxa" 1887, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 890, "sets" 0, "proteins" 890, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 605}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009955", :literature {"PUB00013114" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Krause A" "Sillard R" "Kleemeier B" "Kluver E" "Maronde E" "Conejo-Garcia JR" "Forssmann WG" "Schulz-Knappe P" "Nehls MC" "Wattler F" "Wattler S" "Adermann K."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1110/ps.0213603", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Isolation and biochemical characterization of LEAP-2, a novel blood peptide expressed in the liver.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "143-52", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12493837}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042742", "name" "defense response to bacterium", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009955", "name" "Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 640}}}
