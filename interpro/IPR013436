{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family, designated mobile mystery protein B, are more often encoded within mobilisation-related contexts than not. This includes a CRISPR-associated gene region in Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA, and plasmids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Coxiella burnetii. They are always found together with mobile mystery protein A ([interpro:IPR013435]), a helix-turn-helix putative DNA binding protein. This protein is encoded by the downstream member of the gene pair and belongs to the Fic protein family, where Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) is a regulator of cell division. The characteristics of having a two-gene operon in a varied context, often on plasmids, with one member affecting cell division and the other able to bind DNA, suggests similarity to addiction modules.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036597", "name" "Fido-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02613" "mobile mystery protein B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mobile mystery protein B", "short" "Mobile_mystery_prot_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 241, "taxa" 1880, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1269, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1269, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 947}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013436", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040198", "name" "Fido domain-containing protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR013436", "name" "Mobile mystery protein B", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026287", "name" "Protein adenylyltransferase SoFic-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
