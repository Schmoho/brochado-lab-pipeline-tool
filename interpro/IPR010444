{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Bacteriophage lambda Kil protein like sequences. A cessation of division, followed by one or two fairly synchronous cell divisions in Escherichia coli is due to two genetically separable events: a temporary block of cell division and, at the same time, a block to the initiation of new rounds of DNA replication. The cell division block is a result of the transient expression of the lambda kil gene [[cite:PUB00043652]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lambda kil gene has been shown to be responsible for premature lysis on the addition of chloramphenicol between 15 and 20 min after thermal induction of a lambda prophage [[cite:PUB00043653]]. Induction of a lambda prophage causes the death of the host cell even in the absence of phage replication and lytic functions due to expression of functions from the lambda p(L) operon. The kil gene causes cell death and filamentation [[cite:PUB00012314]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06301" "Bacteriophage lambda Kil protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage lambda Kil", "short" "Phage_lambda_Kil"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 64, "taxa" 403, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 356, "sets" 0, "proteins" 356, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 176}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010444", :literature {"PUB00012314" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Sergueev K" "Yu D" "Austin S" "Court D."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00535-2", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Cell toxicity caused by products of the p(L) operon of bacteriophage lambda.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "227-35", "volume" "272", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11470529}, "PUB00043652" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sergueev K" "Court D" "Reaves L" "Austin S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
