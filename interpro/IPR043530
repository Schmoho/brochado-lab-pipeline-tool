{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CD74 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells and was initially demonstrated to function as an MHC class II chaperone [[cite:PUB00094175]]. It was originally described as the MHC class II-associated invariant chain and its binding to MHC II alpha and beta chains is crucial for the MHCII antigen presentation pathway. Besides chaperone function, it is also involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking, cell migration and cellular signalling as surface receptor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) [[cite:PUB00094177]]. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor binding to CD74 induces its intramembrane cleavage and the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD), which interacts with the transcription factors RUNX (Runt related transcription factor) and NF-kappaB and binds to proximal and distal regulatory sites enriched for genes involved in apoptosis, immune response, and cell migration. Recently, CD74 has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis [[cite:PUB00094174]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036613", "name" "MHC class II-associated invariant chain, trimerisation domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001992" "HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, gamma subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, gamma subunit", "short" "CD74_antigen"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 582, "taxa" 2072, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1182, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 831}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043530", :literature {"PUB00094175" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Stumptner-Cuvelette P" "Benaroch P."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
