{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of conserved hypothetical proteins that almost invariably pair with an uncharacterised radical SAM protein. The pair occurs in about twenty percent of completed prokaryotic genomes. About forty percent of the members of this family occur as fusion proteins, where the C-terminal domain belongs to the uracil-DNA glycosylase family, a DNA repair family (because uracil in DNA is deamidated cytosine). The linkage by gene clustering and correlated species distribution to a radical SAM protein, and by gene fusion to a DNA repair protein family, suggests a role in DNA modification and/or repair.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03915" "TIGR03915 family putative DNA repair protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA repair protein, putative", "short" "DNA_repair_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2080, "taxa" 8242, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7885, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7885, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6323}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0903", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0903"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023875", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023875", "name" "DNA repair protein, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
