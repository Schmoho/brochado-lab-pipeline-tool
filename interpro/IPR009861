{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hematopoietic cell signal transducer (HCST, also known as DAP10) is a transmembrane adaptor that associates with an activation receptor, NKG2D, which is found on NK and subsets of T cells. The ligands for this receptor include MHC class I chain-related (MIC) protein A and protein B and UL16-binding proteins [[cite:PUB00075576]]. In activated mouse natural killer (NK) cells, the NKG2D receptor associates with two intracellular adaptors, DAP10 and DAP12, which trigger phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and Syk family protein tyrosine kinases, respectively. It has been suggested that the DAP10-PI3K pathway is sufficient to initiate NKG2D-mediated killing of target cells [[cite:PUB00013044]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07213" "DAP10 membrane protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR21409" "HEMATOPOIETIC CELL SIGNAL TRANSDUCER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hematopoietic cell signal transducer", "short" "HCST"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 218, "taxa" 963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 433, "sets" 0, "proteins" 425, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 243}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009861", :literature {"PUB00075576" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Marusina AI" "Burgess SJ" "Pathmanathan I" "Borrego F" "Coligan JE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
