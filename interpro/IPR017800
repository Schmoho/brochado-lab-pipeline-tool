{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These proteins are found mostly in three species of Acidobacteria, namely Acidobacteria bacterium (strain Ellin345), Acidobacterium capsulatum ATCC 51196, and Solibacter usitatus (strain Ellin6076), where they form large paralogous families. Each protein contains two copies of a predicted ABC transporter permease doamain. However unlike other proteins containing this domain these proteins are essentially never encoded fused or adjacent to ABC transporter ATP-binding protein ([interpro:IPR003439]) genes. This entry is termed ADOP, for Acidobacterial Duplicated Orphan Permease, to reflect the restricted lineage, internal duplication, lack of associated ATP-binding cassette proteins, and permease homology. The function of these proteins is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03434" "ADOP family duplicated permease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acidobacterial duplicated orphan permease", "short" "ADOP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 112, "taxa" 777, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10612, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10609, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8535}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0751", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0751"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017800", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017800", "name" "Acidobacterial duplicated orphan permease", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
