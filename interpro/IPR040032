{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes proteins containing an N-terminal tripartite DENN domain, including DENND1A (also known as connecdenn 1), DENND1B (connecdenn 2) and DENND1C (connecdenn 3).  These proteins act as guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for Rab35 through the DENN domain.  Inactive GDP-bound RAB35 is converted into its active GTP-bound form by the exchange of GDP to GTP. The DENN domains of DENND1A and DENND1B, but not DENND1C, bind Rab35, indicating that binding and activation are separate.  The C-termini of DENND1A, DENND1B and DENND1C differ significantly, but each binds to clathrin and to the clathrin adaptor AP-2.  This is a means to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and exit from early endosomes [[cite:PUB00090440]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ekk", "name" "Crystal structure of GEF domain of DENND 1A in complex with Rab GTPase Rab35-GDP bound state."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13196" "DENN DOMAIN-CONTAINING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DENN domain-containing protein 1A/1B/1C", "short" "DENND1A/B/C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1079, "taxa" 4361, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5306, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3306}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040032", :literature {"PUB00090440" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Marat AL" "McPherson PS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
