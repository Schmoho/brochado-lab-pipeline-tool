{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the thiamine thiazole synthase, which is involved in biosynthesis of the thiamine precursor thiazole in fungi and in chloroplasts. It catalyses the conversion of NAD and glycine to adenosine diphosphate 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole-2-carboxylic acid (ADT), an adenylated thiazole intermediate. The reaction includes an iron-dependent sulfide transfer from a conserved cysteine residue of the protein to a thiazole intermediate. The enzyme can only undergo a single turnover, which suggests it is a suicide enzyme. It may have additional roles in adaptation to various stress conditions and in DNA damage tolerance [[cite:PUB00064744], [cite:PUB00064745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3fpz", "name" "Saccharomyces cerevisiae THI4p is a suicide thiamin thiazole synthase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03158" "Thiamine thiazole synthase, chloroplastic [THI4]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thiamine thiazole synthase", "short" "Sti35"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1138, "taxa" 3399, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2006, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2006, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1287}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
