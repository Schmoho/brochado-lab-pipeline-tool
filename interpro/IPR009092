{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The baculovirus, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), telokin-like protein (Tlp20) lies in a region of the baculoviral genome that is expressed late in the viral replication cycle, however its function is unknown. Tlp20 was discovered using anti-telokin antibodies, telokin being the C-terminal domain of smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase [[cite:PUB00012259]]. Both Tlp20 and telokin display a seven-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure, although the 3-dimensional structures of the β-barrels are different and there is no sequence homology between the two. Tlp20 is structurally similar to dUTPase in its fold and trimeric assembly [[cite:PUB00037786]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036731", "name" "Baculovirus telokin-like protein 20 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00235" "TLP-20"}, "pfam" {"PF06088" "Nucleopolyhedrovirus telokin-like protein-20 (TLP20)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Telokin-like protein, Tlp20, baculovirus", "short" "Telokin-like_Tlp20_baculovir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 66, "taxa" 210, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 159, "sets" 0, "proteins" 159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009092", :literature {"PUB00012259" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Raynes DA" "Hartshorne DJ" "Guerriero V Jr."], "ISO_journal" "J.
