{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the FpoO subunit of membrane-bound multi-subunit F420H2 dehydrogenase, which oxidises the reduced coenzyme F420H2 to coenzyme F420 and feeds the electrons via an FeS cluster into an energy-conserving electron transport chain [[cite:PUB00044800], [cite:PUB00044673]]. This enzyme plays a role in the methanogenic pathway in methanogenic archaea. Reduced coenzyme F420H2 is the major cytoplasmic electron carrier of methanogens and a reversible hydride donor, much like NADH [[cite:PUB00043561]]. \r\n\r\n<reaction>F420H2 + COB-S-S-CoM = F420 + CoM-SH + CoB-SH</reaction></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where CoB-S-S-CoM (the heterosulphide of 2-mercaptoethanesulphonate and 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate) is the terminal electron acceptor of the methanogenic pathway, and is reduced with the concomitant generation of a transmembrane proton potential and ATP synthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10621" "F420H2 dehydrogenase subunit FpoO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "F420-dehydrogenase, subunit FpoO", "short" "F420H2-DH_FpoO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 162, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 153}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
