{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The biotin operon of Escherichia coli contains 5 structural genes involved in the synthesis of biotin. Transcription of the operon is regulated via one of these proteins, the biotin ligase BirA. BirA is an asymetric protein with 3 specific domains -an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central catalytic domain and a C-terminal of unknown function. The ligase reaction intermediate, biotinyl-5'-AMP, is the co-repressor that triggers DNA binding by BirA.\r\nThe α-helical N-terminal domain of the BirA protein has the helix-turn-helix structure of DNA-binding proteins with a central DNA recognition helix. BirA undergoes several conformational changes related to repressor function and the N-terminal DNA-binding function is connected to the rest of the molecule through a hinge which will allow relocation of the domains during the reaction [[cite:PUB00005496]]. Biotin-binding causes a large structural change thought to facilitate ATP-binding.</p>\r\n<p>Two repressor molecules form the operator-repressor complex, with dimer formation occuring simultaneously with DNA binding. DNA-binding may also cause a conformational change which allows this co-operative interaction. In the dimer structure, the β-sheets in the central domain of each monomer are arranged side-by-side to form a single, seamless β-sheet.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ej9", "name" "Crystal Structure Of Biotin Protein Ligase From Methanococcus jannaschii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045864", "name" "Class II Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/Biotinyl protein ligase (BPL) and lipoyl protein ligase (LPL)", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16442" "biotin protein ligase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00121" "biotin--[acetyl-CoA-carboxylase] ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biotin--acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ligase", "short" "Biotin_CoA_COase_ligase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 75, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11114, "taxa" 41897, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45655, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45653, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 34364}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0036", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0036"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
