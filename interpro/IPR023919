{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a subfamily of a C-N bond-cleaving hydrolases (see [interpro:IPR003010]) that includes nitrilase from Burkholderia phymatum. It catalyses the hydrolysis of a broad range of nitriles to yield their corresponding carboxylic acid and ammonia [[cite:PUB00103888], [cite:PUB00103889]]. The preferred substrate is trans-cinnamonitrile, followed by mono/di-cyanopyridines and aromatic substituted nitriles, with a moderate activity toward 3-phenylpropionitrile [[cite:PUB00103888]]. It shows weak activity toward some aliphatic nitriles, including adiponitrile and glutaronitrile, and the arylacetonitrile 2-thiopheneacetonitrile [[cite:PUB00103888]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036526", "name" "Carbon-nitrogen hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04048" "Nit6803 family nitrilase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrilase", "short" "Nitrilase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 310, "taxa" 1559, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1099, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1099, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 862}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0939", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0939"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
