{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of stress-response A/B barrel domain-containing proteins, including HS1 (also known as Protein HEAT STABLE 1 or Pop3 family protein At3g17210) and DABB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00096739], [cite:PUB00096738]]. Proteins in this family have two stress responsive dimeric A/B barrel domains (Dabb) whose function is not yet clear [[cite:PUB00096738]]. In general, stress-response A/B barrel domain-containing proteins in plants are involved in defense against fungal pathogens. This entry also includes Cannabis sativa olivetolic acid cyclase (OAC), which is an A/B barrel domain-containing protein structurally similar to HS1 and contains amino acid residues that are conserved in plant stress-responsive DABB proteins [[cite:PUB00096737]]. OAC functions in concert with OLS/TKS to form olivetolic acid, an alkylresorcinolic acid that forms the polyketide nucleus of the cannabinoids [[cite:PUB00096737]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes related proteins from bacteria and fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5b08", "name" "Polyketide cyclase OAC from Cannabis sativa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33178" "PTHR33178"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stress-response A/B barrel domain-containing protein HS1/DABB1-like", "short" "HS1/DABB1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2098, "taxa" 7774, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9400, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9400, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6481}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
