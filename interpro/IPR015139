{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Helicobacter pylori (Campylobacter pylori) clinical isolates can be classified into two types according to their degree of pathogenicity. Type I strains are associated with a severe disease pathology, express functional VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin A) and contain an insertion of 40 kb of foreign DNA: the cag (cytotoxin-associated gene) pathogenicity island (cagPAI). Type II strains lack the 40 kb insert, cagPAI. The cagPAI may be divided into two regions, cag I and cag II and contain approximately 16 and 15 genes, respectively. The cagPAI encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS), which delivers CagA into the cytosol of gastric epithelial cells through a rigid needle structure covered by Cag7 or CagY, a VirB10-homologous protein, and CagT, a VirB7-homologous protein, at the base [[cite:PUB00035538]]. The CagA protein is the virulence factor that induces morphological changes in host cells, which may be associated with the development of peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma [[cite:PUB00035539]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>CagZ is a 23kDa protein consisting of a single compact L-shaped domain, composed of seven α-helices that run antiparallel to each other and 70% of the residues are in α-helix conformation: no β-sheet is present.
