{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Endopolyphosphatases are enzymes that hydrolyse long inorganic phosphate chains to shorter chains of (predominantly) 60 or 3 phosphate units. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) member, Ppn1p, is an essential vacuolar enzyme [[cite:PUB00016147]]. It is a homodimer of chains of about 350 amino acids derived by proteolysis, from the amino end, of the precursor sequence. This region contains the metallophosphoesterase domain, which is found in a large number of proteins with phosphoesterase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF027093" "Endopolyphosphatase, Ppn1p type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endopolyphosphatase, Ppn1p-related", "short" "EndopolyPtase_N1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 849, "taxa" 2298, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1521, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1267, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 806}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
