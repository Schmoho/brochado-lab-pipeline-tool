{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase [ec:2.3.1.41] (KAS) [[cite:PUB00000791]] is the enzyme that catalyses the condensation of malonyl-ACP with the growing fatty acid chain. It is found as a component of a number of enzymatic systems, including fatty acid synthetase (FAS), which catalyses the formation of long-chain fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH; the multi-functional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from Penicillium patulum [[cite:PUB00001385]], which is involved in the biosynthesis of a polyketide antibiotic; polyketide antibiotic synthase enzyme systems; Emericella nidulans multifunctional protein Wa, which is involved in the biosynthesis of conidial green pigment; Rhizobium nodulation protein nodE, which probably acts as a beta-ketoacyl synthase in the synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain; narbonolide/10-deoxymethynolide synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of narbomycin and pikromycin in Streptomyces venezuelae [[cite:PUB00080271]]; and yeast mitochondrial protein CEM1. The condensation reaction is a two step process, first the acyl component of an activated acyl primer is transferred to a cysteine residue of the enzyme and is then condensed with an activated malonyl donor with the concomitant release of carbon dioxide.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ix4", "name" "Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial beta-ketoacyl ACP synthase hexanoic acid complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016039", "name" "Thiolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00834" "KAS_I_II"}, "panther" {"PTHR11712" "POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-ketoacyl synthase", "short" "Beta-ketoacyl_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 192, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11115, "taxa" 42551, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 122039, "sets" 0, "proteins" 121673, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 93423}, "pathways" 238}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
