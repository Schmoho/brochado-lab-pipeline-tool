{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The YneA protein is responsible for cell division suppression during the SOS response in Bacillus subtilis. Localization of the FtsZ protein to the cell division site was reduced in dinR-disrupted or yneA-expressing cells, further suggesting that the YneA protein suppresses cell division through the suppression of FtsZ ring formation. Interestingly, the B. subtilis YneA protein is structurally and phylogenetically unrelated to its functional counterpart in Escherichia coli, SulA [[cite:PUB00053936]] (see [interpro:IPR004596]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036779", "name" "LysM domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02014" "Cell division suppressor protein YneA [yneA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division suppressor protein, YneA", "short" "Cell_div_suppressor_YneA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 123, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 80}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022887", :literature {"PUB00053936" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kawai Y" "Moriya S" "Ogasawara N."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
