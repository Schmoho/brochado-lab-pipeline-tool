{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NKAIN (Na,K-Atpase INteracting) proteins are a family of evolutionary conserved transmembrane proteins that localise to neurons, that are critical for neuronal function, and that interact with the beta subunits, beta1 in vertebrates and beta in Drosophila, of Na,K-ATPase. NKAINs have highly conserved trans-membrane domains but otherwise no other characterised domains. NKAINs may function as subunits of pore or channel structures in neurons or they may affect the function of other membrane proteins. They are likely to function within the membrane bilayer [[cite:PUB00044756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05640" "Na,K-Atpase Interacting protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR13084" "T-CELL LYMPHOMA BREAKPOINT-ASSOCIATED TARGET 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Na,K-Atpase Interacting protein", "short" "Na/K-Atpase_Interacting"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 933, "taxa" 3726, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4718, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4510, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2952}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008516", :literature {"PUB00044756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Gorokhova S" "Bibert S" "Geering K" "Heintz N."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
