{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>eL32 is a protein from the large ribosomal subunit that contains a surface-exposed globular domain and a finger-like projection that extends into the RNA core to stabilize the tertiary structure. eL32 does not appear to play a role in forming the A (aminacyl), P (peptidyl) or E (exit) sites of the ribosome, but does interact with 23S rRNA, which has a \"kink-turn\" secondary structure motif. eL32 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and has been identified as a stably expressed housekeeping gene in macrophages of human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, eL32 has also been suggested to play a role as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus.

The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites [[cite:PUB00007068], [cite:PUB00007069]]. About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits.</p>\n\n<p>Many ribosomal proteins, particularly those of the large subunit, are composed of a globular, surfaced-exposed domain with long finger-like projections that extend into the rRNA core to stabilise its structure. Most of the proteins interact with multiple RNA elements, often from different domains. In the large subunit, about 1/3 of the 23S rRNA nucleotides are at least in van der Waal's contact with protein, and L22 interacts with all six domains of the 23S rRNA. Proteins S4 and S7, which initiate assembly of the 16S rRNA, are located at junctions of five and four RNA helices, respectively. In this way proteins serve to organise and stabilise the rRNA tertiary structure. While the crucial activities of decoding and peptide transfer are RNA based, proteins play an active role in functions that may have evolved to streamline the process of protein synthesis. In addition to their function in the ribosome, many ribosomal proteins have some function 'outside' the ribosome [[cite:PUB00007069], [cite:PUB00007070]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9axu", "name" "Non-translating S. pombe ribosome large subunit"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036351", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein eL32 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00513" "Ribosomal_L32_L32e"}, "smart" {"SM01393" "Ribosomal_L32e"}, "panther" {"PTHR23413" "60S RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L32 AND DNA-DIRECTED RNA POLYMERASE II, SUBUNIT N"}, "pfam" {"PF01655" "Ribosomal protein L32"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein eL32", "short" "Ribosomal_eL32"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 605, "domain_architectures" 148, "proteomes" 2958, "taxa" 11920, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9439, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6786}, "pathways" 72}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00502", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00502"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001515", :literature {"PUB00028498" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5481", "authors" ["Ban N" "Nissen P" "Hansen J" "Moore PB" "Steitz TA."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5481.905", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The complete atomic structure of the large ribosomal subunit at 2.4 A resolution.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "905-20", "volume" "289", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10937989}, "PUB00079523" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wang J" "Jing W" "Yuan S" "Sheng Y" "Jiang S" "Jang S."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2006.02.040", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "The ribosomal protein L32-2 (RPL32-2) of S. pombe exhibits a novel extraribosomal function by acting as a potential transcriptional regulator.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1827-32", "volume" "580", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16516201}, "PUB00079521" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Karan D" "Kelly DL" "Rizzino A" "Lin MF" "Batra SK."], "ISO_journal" "Carcinogenesis", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/carcin/23.6.967", "medline_journal" "Carcinogenesis", "title" "Expression profile of differentially-regulated genes during progression of androgen-independent growth in human prostate cancer cells.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "967-75", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12082018}, "PUB00007068" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ramakrishnan V" "Moore PB."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
