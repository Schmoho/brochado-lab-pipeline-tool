{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of di-c-heme containing proteins MauG and cytochrome peroxidases.</p>\n\n<p>MauG catalyses a six-electron oxidation required for posttranslational modification of a precursor of methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) to complete the biosynthesis of its protein-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor involved in methylamine metabolism  [[cite:PUB00060310]]. MauG contains two heme c binding sites with a Ca2+ ion linked to the two heme. This structure is also found in heme-containing peroxidases. It seems that tightly-bound Ca2+ is critical for the activity of a variety of peroxidases [[cite:PUB00060309]]. MauG does not function primarily as a peroxidase, but can use H2O2 to catalyse posttranslational modifications of its protein substrate. This suggests that MauG may have originally been a peroxidase and then evolved to acquire its new function [[cite:PUB00060309]].</p>\n\n<p>Cytochrome-c peroxidase IdrP1/2 from Pseudomonas are involved in iodate respiration. They may reduce the H2O2 produced by IdrA/IdrB to H2O, using a reduced cytochrome c as the electron donor [[cite:PUB00100773]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hq9", "name" "CcpA from G. sulfurreducens, S134P variant"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000294" "Di-c-type haem protein, MauG/cytochrome c peroxidase type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Di-c-type haem protein, MauG/cytochrome c peroxidase", "short" "MauG/Cytc_peroxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 23, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2025, "taxa" 8972, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15121, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14111, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10577}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
