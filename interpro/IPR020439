{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has a variety of biological functions, including stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses [[cite:PUB00019742]]. It is required for division of CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype, a process that is increased by inhibition of IL-2 [[cite:PUB00046028]].
