{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small group of anthranilate synthases mainly from alpha proteobacteria and Nostoc (a cyanobacterium). Anthranilate synthase catalyses the first step in the pathway for the biosynthesis of tryprophan from chorismate. The genes involved in this enzymatic reaction are trpE and trpG, which encode component I and II of the anthranilate synthase. This group of proteins consists of a TrpE(G) fused protein [[cite:PUB00067852]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR005801", "name" "ADC synthase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036934" "Bacterial anthranilate synthase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01815" "anthranilate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anthranilate synthase, bacteria", "short" "TrpE-G_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 590, "taxa" 2457, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2076, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2074, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1631}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0037", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0037"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
