{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NodN (nodulation factor N) contains a single hot dog fold similar to those of the peroxisomal Hydratase-Dehydrogenase-Epimerase (HDE) protein, and the fatty acid synthase beta subunit [[cite:PUB00055611]].  Rhizobium and related species form nodules on the roots of their legume hosts, a symbiotic process that requires production of Nod factors, which are signal molecules involved in root hair deformation and meristematic cell division.  The nodulation gene products, including NodN, are involved in producing the Nod factors, however the role played by NodN is unclear [[cite:PUB00089555], [cite:PUB00089556], [cite:PUB00089557], [cite:PUB00089558]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2c2i", "name" "Structure and function of Rv0130, a conserved hypothetical protein from M.tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029069", "name" "HotDog domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03450" "NodN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nodulation protein N-like", "short" "NodN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3069, "taxa" 11301, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15864, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12361}, "pathways" 64}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
