{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the non-structural protein ORF5 from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and similar proteins from betacoronaviruses in the merbecovirus subgenera (C lineage). ORF5 is also called non-structural protein 3d (NS3d) or accessory protein 3d in some bat merbecoviruses. MERS-CoV is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus with pathogenic mechanisms that may be driven by innate immune pathways. MERS-CoV ORF5 acts as an interferon antagonist and may play a role in circumventing the innate immunity of host cells [[cite:PUB00095876], [cite:PUB00095877]]. ORF5/NS3d from merbecovirus (betacoronavirus, lineage C) may not be related to ORF5 proteins from other lineages.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21645" "Non-structural protein ORF5 from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and related betacoronaviruses in the C lineage"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Non-structural protein ORF5, MERS-CoV-like", "short" "MERS-CoV-like_ORF5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 66, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 139, "sets" 0, "proteins" 139, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044323", :literature {"PUB00095876" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Menachery VD" "Mitchell HD" "Cockrell AS" "Gralinski LE" "Yount BL Jr" "Graham RL" "McAnarney ET" "Douglas MG" "Scobey T" "Beall A" "Dinnon K 3rd" "Kocher JF" "Hale AE" "Stratton KG" "Waters KM" "Baric RS."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "MERS-CoV Accessory ORFs Play Key Role for Infection and Pathogenesis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28830941}, "PUB00095877" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Yang Y" "Zhang L" "Geng H" "Deng Y" "Huang B" "Guo Y" "Zhao Z" "Tan W."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Cell", "title" "The structural and accessory proteins M, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are potent interferon antagonists.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "951-61", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24318862}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044323", "name" "Non-structural protein ORF5, MERS-CoV-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
