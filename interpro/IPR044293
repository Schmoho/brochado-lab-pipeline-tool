{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the paclobutrazol-resistant (PRE) family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) factors, including PRE1-6 from Arabidopsis and Increased Leaf Inclination (ILI) family of atypical bHLH transcription factors in rice. The members of this family ILI1/2/3/4/5/6/7 lack the basic region for DNA binding and have been implicated in brassinosteroids signalling [[cite:PUB00155554]]. They are involved in development in Arabidopsis and rice [[cite:PUB00095759], [cite:PUB00095760]]. They lack the basic domain required for DNA binding but dimerises with DNA binding bHLH factors to inhibit their DNA binding. Moreover, they also antagonize their interacting HLH or bHLH proteins [[cite:PUB00074410]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036638", "name" "Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23174" "ILI bHLH domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR46446" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR PRE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor PRE", "short" "PRE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 237, "taxa" 904, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2345, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2334, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1434}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044293", :literature {"PUB00095759" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Lee S" "Lee S" "Yang KY" "Kim YM" "Park SY" "Kim SY" "Soh MS."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "Overexpression of PRE1 and its homologous genes activates Gibberellin-dependent responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "591-600", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16527868}, "PUB00095760" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zhang LY" "Bai MY" "Wu J" "Zhu JY" "Wang H" "Zhang Z" "Wang W" "Sun Y" "Zhao J" "Sun X" "Yang H" "Xu Y" "Kim SH" "Fujioka S" "Lin WH" "Chong K" "Lu T" "Wang ZY."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3767-80", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20009022}, "PUB00074410" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Bai MY" "Fan M" "Oh E" "Wang ZY."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.112.105163", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "A triple helix-loop-helix/basic helix-loop-helix cascade controls cell elongation downstream of multiple hormonal and environmental signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "4917-29", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23221598}, "PUB00155554" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Liu M" "Lu M" "Zhao Z" "Luo Q" "Liu F" "Zhao J" "He Y" "Tian Y" "Zhan H."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/plphys/kiad635", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Rice ILI atypical bHLH transcription factors antagonize OsbHLH157/OsbHLH158 during brassinosteroid signaling.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "1545-1562", "volume" "194", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38039100}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0046983", "name" "protein dimerization activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0040008", "name" "regulation of growth", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044293", "name" "Transcription factor PRE", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 1447}}}
