{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interferon (INF)-gamma is a dimeric glycoprotein produced by activated T cells and natural killer cells. Although originally isolated based on its antiviral activity, INF-gamma also displays powerful anti-proliferative and immuno-modulatory activities, which are essential for developing appropriate cellular defences against a variety of infectious agents. The first step in eliciting these responses is the specific high affinity interaction of INF-gamma with its cell-surface receptor (INF-gammaRalpha); the complex then interacts with at least one of a family of additional species-specific accessory factors (AF-1 or INF-gammabeta), which convey different cellular responses. One such response is the association and phosphorylation of two protein tyrosine kinases (Jak-1 and Jak-2), which in turn stimulate nuclear transcription activators [[cite:PUB00011614], [cite:PUB00095243]].</p>\n\n<p>The human INF-gammaR, is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily. It is expressed in a membrane-bound form in many cell types, and is over-expressed in tumour cells. It comprises an extracellular portion of 229 residues, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain of 221 residues. As with other members of its superfamily, the cytokine-binding sites are formed by a small set of closely-spaced surface loops that extend from a Î²-sheet core, much like antigen-binding sites on antibodies. The extracellular INF-gammaR monomer comprises two domains (domain D1 from residue 14-102, and domain D2 from residue 114-221), each resembling an Ig fold with fibronectin type III topology [[cite:PUB00011615]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry refers to the interferon gamma receptor alpha subunit, also known as interferon gamma receptor 1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01777" "INTERFERONGR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interferon gamma receptor alpha subunit", "short" "Interferon_gamma_rcpt_asu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 380, "taxa" 1222, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1886, "sets" 0, "proteins" 540, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 388}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008355", :literature {"PUB00011614" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6537", "authors" ["Walter MR" "Windsor WT" "Nagabhushan TL" "Lundell DJ" "Lunn CA" "Zauodny PJ" "Narula SK."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/376230a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Crystal structure of a complex between interferon-gamma and its soluble high-affinity receptor.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "230-5", "volume" "376", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7617032}, "PUB00011615" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sogabe S" "Stuart F" "Henke C" "Bridges A" "Williams G" "Birch A" "Winkler FK" "Robinson JA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
