{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In many molybdopterin-containing enzymes, including nitrate reductase and dimethylsulfoxide reductase, the cofactor is molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotide (molybdopterin modified by attachment of a GMP group to the terminal phosphate). This entry represents the molybdenum cofactor guanylyltransferase MobA. In E. coli, MobA transfers a GMP moiety from GTP to the Mo-molybdopterin (Mo-MPT) cofactor (Moco or molybdenum cofactor) to form the Mo-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (Mo-MGD) cofactor. MobA is also involved in the biosynthesis of the bis-MGD form of the Moco cofactor (Mo-bisMGD) in which the metal is symmetrically ligated by the dithiolene groups of two MGD molecules. It is necessary and sufficient for the in vitro activation of the DMSOR molybdoenzyme that uses the Mo-bisMGD form of molybdenum cofactor, which implies formation and efficient insertion of the cofactor into the enzyme without the need of a chaperone. It is specific for GTP since other nucleotides such as ATP and GMP can not be utilised [[cite:PUB00015694], [cite:PUB00060606], [cite:PUB00060607], [cite:PUB00060608]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fr9", "name" "STRUCTURE OF E.
