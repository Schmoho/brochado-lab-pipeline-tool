{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family, including paralogues KPN_01023 ([swissprot:A6T787]) and KPN_01923 ([swissprot:A6T9T3]) from Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578, are small proteins, typically about 40 amino acid residues in length. They contain a highly hydrophobic region with a composition typical of transmembrane segments, followed by a highly basic region. Analogous proteins of similar size, with apparently similar hydrophobic regions, have been described as membrane-associated proteins expressed in response to various types of cell envelope stress. The function of these proteins is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033853" "small membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small membrane protein KPN01023-like", "short" "KPN01023-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 73, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 274, "sets" 0, "proteins" 274, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 170}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049833", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049833", "name" "Small membrane protein KPN01023-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
