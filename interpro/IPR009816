{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes spermatogenesis-associated serine-rich protein 2 (SPATS2) and its paralogue, SPATS2-like protein (SPAT2L) from mammals. SPATS2 is involved in spermatogenesis and likely to be a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein [[cite:PUB00101497], [cite:PUB00101498]]. SPATS2 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and may function as an oncogene. It constitutes a novel diagnostic prognostic marker in liver cancer and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC [[cite:PUB00101499]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15623" "SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED SERINE-RICH PROTEIN 2-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF07139" "Spermatogenesis-associated serine-rich protein 2-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SPATS2-like", "short" "SPATS2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 799, "taxa" 2819, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2173, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1483}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009816", :literature {"PUB00101498" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yan J" "Huang QY" "Huang YJ" "Wang CS" "Liu PX."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "SPATS2 is positively activated by long noncoding RNA SNHG5 via regulating DNMT3a expression to promote hepatocellular carcinoma progression.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e0262262", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35077478}, "PUB00101499" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Xing J" "Tian Y" "Ji W" "Wang X."], "ISO_journal" "Medicine (Baltimore)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Medicine (Baltimore)", "title" "Comprehensive evaluation of SPATS2 expression and its prognostic potential in liver cancer.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "e19230", "volume" "99", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32118724}, "PUB00101497" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Dong G" "Zhang S" "Shen S" "Sun L" "Wang X" "Wang H" "Wu J" "Liu T" "Wang C" "Wang H" "Lu T" "Rao B" "Ren Z."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Dis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Death Dis", "title" "SPATS2, negatively regulated by miR-145-5p, promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression through regulating cell cycle.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "837", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33037180}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009816", "name" "SPATS2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 17, "alignment:full" 1696}}}
