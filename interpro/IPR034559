{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These enzymes are involved in the repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage during spore germination. They can repair thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine (known as spore photoproduct (SP)) by in situ monomerization of spore photoproduct to two thymines. This family of enzymes uses the SAM as a cofactor (rather than in a stoichiometric manner). This set of SPL enzymes is distinguished from the other SPL family because its fourth conserved Cys residue occurs before the CxxxCxxC motif, unlike in the other SPL family, in which is occurs after the CxxxCxxC motif [[cite:PUB00065909]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents spore photoproduct lyases mostly from Clostridia.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00412" "spore photoproduct lyase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spore photoproduct lyase, Clostridia type", "short" "SPL_Clostridia"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 197, "taxa" 765, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 550, "sets" 0, "proteins" 550, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 434}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
