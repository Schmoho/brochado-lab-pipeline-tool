{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a cell division protein, designated SepF, which is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria. SepF accumulates at the cell division site in an FtsZ-dependent manner and is required for proper septum formation [[cite:PUB00043574], [cite:PUB00099724]]. This protein uses an amphipathic helix for membrane binding and polymerises into large rings that bundle FtsZ filaments [[cite:PUB00099725]]. Mutants are viable but the formation of the septum is much slower and occurs with a very abnormal morphology. This entry also includes archaeal related proteins, such as SepF from Haloferax volcanii [[cite:PUB00099723]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6scq", "name" "Cell Division Protein SepF in complex with C-terminal domain of FtsZ"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038594", "name" "SepF-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04472" "Cell division protein SepF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein SepF/SepF-related", "short" "Cell_div_SepF/SepF-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 4181, "taxa" 15414, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18808, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18801, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14259}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007561", :literature {"PUB00043574" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hamoen LW" "Meile JC" "de Jong W" "Noirot P" "Errington J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
