{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzyme responsible for bioluminescence in motile Gram-negative luminous bacteria is bacterial luciferase [[cite:PUB00028002], [cite:PUB00001517], [cite:PUB00028001]] ([ec:1.14.14.3]), which catalyses the oxidation of reduced riboflavin phosphate (FMNH2) and a long chain fatty aldehyde with the emission of blue green light (490 nm). Luciferase is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of an alpha subunit (gene luxA) and a beta subunit (gene luxB). The two subunits appear to have arisen by gene duplication.</p>\n\n<p>The bioluminescence operon of some species of Photobacterium encodes a protein known as the non-fluorescent flavoprotein (NFP) (gene luxF). NFP, whose function is not yet known, contains an unusual non-covalently bound flavin.
