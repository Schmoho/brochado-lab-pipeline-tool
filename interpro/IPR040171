{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Harmonin-binding protein USHBP1 also known as MCC2) and colorectal mutant cancer protein known as MCC.</p>\n\n<p>MCC has been found to suppresses cell proliferation and the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer cells [[cite:PUB00090645], [cite:PUB00101149]]. It may works as a scaffold protein regulating cell movement and able to bind Scrib, beta-catenin and NHERF1/2 [[cite:PUB00090644]]. MCC1 inhibits DNA binding of b-catenin/TCF/LEF transcription factors, and it is involved in cell migration independently of RAC1, CDC42 and p21-activated kinase (PAK) activation [[cite:PUB00090645], [cite:PUB00090644], [cite:PUB00101148]].</p>\n\n<p>MCC2 protein binds the first PDZ domain of AIE-75 with its C-terminal amino acids -DTFL. A possible role of MCC2 as a tumour suppressor has been put forward. The carboxyl terminus of the predicted protein was DTFL which matched the consensus motif X-S/T-X-phi (phi: hydrophobic amino acid residue) for binding to the PDZ domain of AIE-75 [[cite:PUB00045022], [cite:PUB00045023]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23347" "COLORECTAL MUTANT CANCER PROTEIN MCC PROTEIN -RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Harmonin-binding protein USHBP1-like", "short" "USBP1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 806, "taxa" 3200, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2429, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1470}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040171", :literature {"PUB00101148" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Pangon L" "Van Kralingen C" "Abas M" "Daly RJ" "Musgrove EA" "Kohonen-Corish MR."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta", "title" "The PDZ-binding motif of MCC is phosphorylated at position -1 and controls lamellipodia formation in colon epithelial cells.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1058-67", "volume" "1823", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22480440}, "PUB00101149" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pangon L" "Mladenova D" "Watkins L" "Van Kralingen C" "Currey N" "Al-Sohaily S" "Lecine P" "Borg JP" "Kohonen-Corish MR."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Cancer", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Cancer", "title" "MCC inhibits beta-catenin transcriptional activity by sequestering DBC1 in the cytoplasm.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "55-64", "volume" "136", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24824780}, "PUB00090645" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Fukuyama R" "Niculaita R" "Ng KP" "Obusez E" "Sanchez J" "Kalady M" "Aung PP" "Casey G" "Sizemore N."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2008.204", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Mutated in colorectal cancer, a putative tumor suppressor for serrated colorectal cancer, selectively represses beta-catenin-dependent transcription.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "6044-55", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18591935}, "PUB00090644" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Arnaud C" "Sebbagh M" "Nola S" "Audebert S" "Bidaut G" "Hermant A" "Gayet O" "Dusetti NJ" "Ollendorff V" "Santoni MJ" "Borg JP" "Lecine P."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2009.06.034", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "MCC, a new interacting protein for Scrib, is required for cell migration in epithelial cells.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "2326-32", "volume" "583", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19555689}, "PUB00045022" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ishikawa S" "Kobayashi I" "Hamada J" "Tada M" "Hirai A" "Furuuchi K" "Takahashi Y" "Ba Y" "Moriuchi T."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00378-X", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Interaction of MCC2, a novel homologue of MCC tumor suppressor, with PDZ-domain Protein AIE-75.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "101-10", "volume" "267", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11311560}, "PUB00045023" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hirai A" "Tada M" "Furuuchi K" "Ishikawa S" "Makiyama K" "Hamada J" "Okada F" "Kobayashi I" "Fukuda H" "Moriuchi T."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2004.02.005", "medline_journal" "Cancer Lett", "title" "Expression of AIE-75 PDZ-domain protein induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in human colorectal adenocarcinoma SW480 cells.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "209-18", "volume" "211", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15219944}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040171", "name" "Harmonin-binding protein USHBP1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
