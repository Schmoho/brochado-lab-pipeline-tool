{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents GRB2-associated-binding proteins 1-4 (Gab1-4) and similar proteins from animals. Proteins in this family contain one PH domain. GAB1 from humans and its orthologues dos and soc-1 from Drosophila and C. elegans [[cite:PUB00086574]], respectively, function as adapter proteins that modulate intracellular signalling cascades triggered by activated receptor-type kinases. Gab1 from human plays a role in FGFR1 signalling, is involved in the MET/HGF-signalling pathway and functions as an important upstream regulator in EGF-mediated activation of mTORCs [[cite:PUB00099894], [cite:PUB00099895]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45960" "GRB2-ASSOCIATED-BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GRB2-associated-binding protein 1-4-like", "short" "Gab1-4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 938, "taxa" 3773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4642, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4642, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3018}, "pathways" 94}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046355", :literature {"PUB00086574" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hopper NA."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.106.055822", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The adaptor protein soc-1/Gab1 modifies growth factor receptor output in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "163-75", "volume" "173", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16547100}, "PUB00099894" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Yousaf R" "Ahmed ZM" "Giese AP" "Morell RJ" "Lagziel A" "Dabdoub A" "Wilcox ER" "Riazuddin S" "Friedman TB" "Riazuddin S."], "ISO_journal" "J Clin Invest", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Clin Invest", "title" "Modifier variant of METTL13 suppresses human GAB1-associated profound deafness.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1509-1522", "volume" "128", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29408807}, "PUB00099895" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chang CH" "Chan PC" "Li JR" "Chen CJ" "Shieh JJ" "Fu YC" "Chen HC" "Wu MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Oncotarget", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncotarget", "title" "Gab1 is essential for membrane translocation, activity and integrity of mTORCs after EGF stimulation in urothelial cell carcinoma.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1478-89", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25596749}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046355", "name" "GRB2-associated-binding protein 1-4-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
