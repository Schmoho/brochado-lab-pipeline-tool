{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The transport of peptides into cells is a well-documented biological phenomenon which is accomplished by specific, energy-dependent transporters found in a number of organisms as diverse as bacteria and humans.  The amino acid/peptide transporter family of proteins is distinct from the ABC-type peptide transporters and was uncovered by sequence analysis of a number of recently discovered peptide transport proteins [[cite:PUB00003872]]. This family consists of bacterial proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters, although they are found in yeast, plants and animals. They function by proton symport in a 1:1 stoichiometry, which is variable in different species. Structurally, these transporters present a conserved architecture consisting of 14 transmembrane α-helices with N-terminal and C-terminal six-helix bundles connected by two transmembrane α-helices (HA and HB) [[cite:PUB00094229]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Dipeptide and tripeptide permease A (DtpA) is a proton-dependent permease that transports di- and tripeptides, and structurally related peptidomimetics such as aminocephalosporins into the cell [[cite:PUB00054272], [cite:PUB00054273], [cite:PUB00054274]].
