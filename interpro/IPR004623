{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Kdp is a high affinity ATP-driven K+ transport system in Escherichia coli. It is a membrane complex (KdpFABC) composed of four subunits, KdpA, KdpB, KdpC and KdpF, although KdpF is not present in some species [[cite:PUB00099204]]. It maintains intracellular homeostasis, cell shape and turgor under potassium-limiting conditions. KdpA is the K+-transporting subunit of this complex, while KdpB is a P-type ATPase that provides the energy for K+ transport. Both subunits are joined by KdpC, a probable catalytic chaperone and KdpF, that may stabilize the complex. KdpC and KdpF have single transmembrane helices and no known homologues outside of Kdp [[cite:PUB00099204], [cite:PUB00008269]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family represents the KdpA subunit of KdpFABC complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30607" "POTASSIUM-TRANSPORTING ATPASE A CHAIN"}, "hamap" {"MF_00275" "Potassium-transporting ATPase potassium-binding subunit [kdpA]"}, "pfam" {"PF03814" "Potassium-transporting ATPase A subunit"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00680" "potassium-transporting ATPase subunit KdpA"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001294" "H(+)/K(+)-transporting ATPase, subunit A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Potassium-transporting ATPase A chain", "short" "KdpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 3568, "taxa" 15444, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16766, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16752, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12874}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0172", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0172"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004623", :literature {"PUB00008269" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gassel M" "Siebers A" "Epstein W" "Altendorf K."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
