{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNAJB2 (also known as HSJ-1) contains an N-terminal J-domain and the C-terminal UIMs (ubiquitin (Ub)-interacting motifs)-containing domain. It binds and stimulates ATPase activity of HSP70 through its J-domain [[cite:PUB00093774]]. It also binds to polyUb chains through its UIM domain and contributes to the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins [[cite:PUB00093775], [cite:PUB00093776]].</p>\n\n<p>DNAJB6 (also known as HSJ-2) plays an indispensable role in the organization of KRT8/KRT18 filaments. It acts as an endogenous molecular chaperone for neuronal proteins including huntingtin. DNAJB6 is able to suppress aggregation and toxicity of polyglutamine-containing, aggregation-prone proteins. It also has a stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of HSP70 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner and hence acts as a co-chaperone of HSP70 [[cite:PUB00101420], [cite:PUB00101419]]. DNAJB8 is also a suppressor of aggregation and toxicity of disease-associated polyglutamine proteins [[cite:PUB00101421]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45168" "DNAJ HOMOLOG SUBFAMILY B MEMBER 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 2/6-like", "short" "DNJB2/6-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1150, "taxa" 5427, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5292, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5292, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3252}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043183", :literature {"PUB00101419" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sarparanta J" "Jonson PH" "Golzio C" "Sandell S" "Luque H" "Screen M" "McDonald K" "Stajich JM" "Mahjneh I" "Vihola A" "Raheem O" "Penttila S" "Lehtinen S" "Huovinen S" "Palmio J" "Tasca G" "Ricci E" "Hackman P" "Hauser M" "Katsanis N" "Udd B."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Genet", "title" "Mutations affecting the cytoplasmic functions of the co-chaperone DNAJB6 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "450-5, S1-2", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22366786}, "PUB00101420" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Izawa I" "Nishizawa M" "Ohtakara K" "Ohtsuka K" "Inada H" "Inagaki M."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Identification of Mrj, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein, as a keratin 8/18 filament regulatory protein.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "34521-7", "volume" "275", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10954706}, "PUB00101421" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hageman J" "Rujano MA" "van Waarde MA" "Kakkar V" "Dirks RP" "Govorukhina N" "Oosterveld-Hut HM" "Lubsen NH" "Kampinga HH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "A DNAJB chaperone subfamily with HDAC-dependent activities suppresses toxic protein aggregation.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "355-69", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20159555}, "PUB00093774" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Gao XC" "Zhou CJ" "Zhou ZR" "Wu M" "Cao CY" "Hu HY."], "ISO_journal" "J.
