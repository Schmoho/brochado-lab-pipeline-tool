{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP, also known as LAMTOR5) was originally recognised for its association with the X protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and ability to down-regulate HBV replication [[cite:PUB00055473]]. When complexed to the anti-apoptotic protein survivin, HBXIP interferes with apoptosome assembly, preventing recruitment of pro-caspase-9 to oligomerised APAF1, thereby selectively suppressing apoptosis initiated via the mitochondrial/cytochrome c pathway [[cite:PUB00055472]]. HBXIP is one of the Ragulator components that are required for mTORC1 activation by amino acids [[cite:PUB00068038]]. It is also part of the AA (amino acid) sensing machinery in human CD4+ T cells [[cite:PUB00076183]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3msh", "name" "Crystal structure of Hepatitis B X-Interacting Protein at high resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02092" "Hepatitis B virus X-interacting protein"}, "pfam" {"PF16672" "Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR5"}, "panther" {"PTHR13342" "RAGULATOR COMPLEX PROTEIN LAMTOR5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR5", "short" "LAMTOR5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 1028, "taxa" 4123, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1707, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1698, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1124}, "pathways" 40}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2031", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2031"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024135", :literature {"PUB00055472" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Marusawa H" "Matsuzawa S" "Welsh K" "Zou H" "Armstrong R" "Tamm I" "Reed JC."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdg263", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "HBXIP functions as a cofactor of survivin in apoptosis suppression.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "2729-40", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12773388}, "PUB00055473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Melegari M" "Scaglioni PP" "Wands JR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
