{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial and archaeal uridine phosphorylases unrelated to the mammalian enzymes of the same name. The Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00013819]], Salmonella [[cite:PUB00013784]] and Klebsiella [[cite:PUB00000763]] genes have been characterised. Sequences from Clostridium, Streptomyces, Treponema, Aeropyrum and Pyrobaculum are also included in this family, but it does not include related sequences from Halobacterium, which are more distantly related and represent enzymes with a slightly different substrate specificity. Also distantly related is a clade of archaeal sequences which are related to the DeoD family of inosine phosphorylases ([interpro:IPR004402]) as they are to these uridine phosphorylases. This clade includes a characterised protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus which has been misnamed as a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, but which acts on inosine and guanosine - it is unclear whether uridine has been evaluated as a substrate [[cite:PUB00002872]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7q1i", "name" "Hybrid form of uridine phosphorylase from E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium in the presence glycerol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01718" "uridine phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uridine phosphorylase", "short" "Uridine_phosphorylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 74, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 615, "taxa" 3833, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3501, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3501, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2707}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1576", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1576"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
