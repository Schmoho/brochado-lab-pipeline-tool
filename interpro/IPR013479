{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ADP-ribosyl-dinitrogen reductase hydrolase ([ec:3.2.2.24]), also known as dinitrogenase reductase activating glycohydrolase (DraG). It is involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation activity by the reversible ADP-ribosylation of the dinitrogenase reductase component of the nitrogenase enzyme complex [[cite:PUB00033865]]. The ADP-ribosyltransferase protein DraT acts to inactivate dinitrogen reductase by adding an ADP-ribose group to this enzyme. DraG, in contrast, activates this enzyme by removing the attached ADP-ribose group.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ovo", "name" "Structure of DraG-GlnZ-delta42-54 complex from Azospirillum brasilense"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036705", "name" "ADP-ribosylation/Crystallin J1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02662" "ADP-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase] hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosyl-dinitrogen reductase hydrolase", "short" "ADP-ribosyl_diN_reduct_hydro"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 206, "taxa" 850, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 602, "sets" 0, "proteins" 602, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 472}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
