{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyridoxal phosphate is the active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine or pyridoxal). Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is a versatile catalyst, acting as a coenzyme in a multitude of reactions, including decarboxylation, deamination and transamination  [[cite:PUB00035505], [cite:PUB00006322], [cite:PUB00035506]]. PLP-dependent enzymes are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids and amino acid-derived metabolites, but they are also found in the biosynthetic pathways of amino sugars and in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters; pyridoxal phosphate can also inhibit DNA polymerases and several steroid receptors  [[cite:PUB00035507]]. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain can cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy [[cite:PUB00035508]].</p>\n\n<p>PLP enzymes exist in their resting state as a Schiff base, the aldehyde group of PLP forming a linkage with the ε-amino group of an active site lysine residue on the enzyme. The α-amino group of the substrate displaces the lysine ε-amino group, in the process forming a new aldimine with the substrate. This aldimine is the common central intermediate for all PLP-catalysed reactions, enzymatic and non-enzymatic [[cite:PUB00035504]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>A number of pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases share regions of sequence similarity, particularly in the vicinity of a conserved lysine residue, which provides the attachment site for the pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) group [[cite:PUB00001452], [cite:PUB00003414]]. Among these enzymes are aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (L-dopa decarboxylase or tryptophan decarboxylase), which catalyses the decarboxylation of tryptophan to tryptamine [[cite:PUB00002358]]; tyrosine decarboxylase, which converts tyrosine into tyramine; histidine decarboxylase, which catalyses the decarboxylation of histidine to histamine [[cite:PUB00004715]]; L-aspartate decarboxylase, which converts aspartate to beta-alanine [[cite:PUB00076906]]; and phenylacetaldehyde synthase that catalyses the decarboxylation of L-phenylalanine to 2-phenylethylamine [[cite:PUB00094543]].
