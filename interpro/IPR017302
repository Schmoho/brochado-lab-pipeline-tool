This protein may act by competing with the putative neuronal protein kinase DCAMKL1 in binding to a target protein, and thereby participate in a signalling pathway that is crucial for neuronal interaction before and during migration, possibly as part of a calcium ion-dependent signal transduction pathway. It may also be involved with LIS-1 in an overlapping, but distinct, signalling pathways that promotes neuronal migration.  Defects in neuronal migration protein doublecortin are the cause of lissencephaly X-linked type 1 (LISX1), a classic lissencephaly characterised by mental retardation and seizures that are more severe in male patients [[cite:PUB00006669], [cite:PUB00053143]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037870" "Neuronal migration protein doublecortin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuronal migration protein doublecortin, chordates", "short" "DCX_chordates"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 424, "taxa" 1367, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 785, "sets" 0, "proteins" 782, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 562}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017302", :literature {"PUB00053143" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gleeson JG" "Allen KM" "Fox JW" "Lamperti ED" "Berkovic S" "Scheffer I" "Cooper EC" "Dobyns WB" "Minnerath SR" "Ross ME" "Walsh CA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80899-5", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Doublecortin, a brain-specific gene mutated in human X-linked lissencephaly and double cortex syndrome, encodes a putative signaling protein.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "63-72", "volume" "92", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9489700}, "PUB00053144" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Boekhoorn K" "Sarabdjitsingh A" "Kommerie H" "de Punder K" "Schouten T" "Lucassen PJ" "Vreugdenhil E."], "ISO_journal" "J.
