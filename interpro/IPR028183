{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from animals, including Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 5 (UQCC5), also known as small integral membrane protein 4 (SMIM4) from humans [[cite:PUB00101053]]. These proteins mediates early mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III) biogenesis and are required for its assembly and stability [[cite:PUB00103608]]. They participate in regulating the levels of electron transport chain proteins, and therefore energy supply, in response to changes in energy demand [[cite:PUB00103608]]. SMIM4/UQCC5 is also involved in the first steps of cytochrome c oxidase complex (complex IV) assembly [[cite:PUB00101053]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35250" "SMALL INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 4"}, "pfam" {"PF15114" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0640"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 5", "short" "UQCC5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 684, "taxa" 2875, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 944, "sets" 0, "proteins" 943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 681}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028183", :literature {"PUB00103608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Liang C" "Zhang S" "Robinson D" "Ploeg MV" "Wilson R" "Nah J" "Taylor D" "Beh S" "Lim R" "Sun L" "Muoio DM" "Stroud DA" "Ho L."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Mitochondrial microproteins link metabolic cues to respiratory chain biogenesis.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "111204", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35977508}, "PUB00101053" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Dennerlein S" "Poerschke S" "Oeljeklaus S" "Wang C" "Richter-Dennerlein R" "Sattmann J" "Bauermeister D" "Hanitsch E" "Stoldt S" "Langer T" "Jakobs S" "Warscheid B" "Rehling P."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Defining the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome identifies SMIM4 and TMEM223 as respiratory chain assembly factors.
