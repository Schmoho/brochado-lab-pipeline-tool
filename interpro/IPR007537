{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>tRNA His molecules are unusual in having an extra 5' GMP residue (G(-1)) that, in eukaryotes, is added after transcription and RNase P cleavage. Incorporation of this G(-1) residue is a rare example of nucleotide addition occurring at an RNA 5' end in a normal phosphodiester linkage. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YGR024c (Thg1p) protein is responsible for this guanylyltransferase reaction [[cite:PUB00020433]]. It catalyses the guanylyltransferase step of G(-1) addition using a ppp-tRNA His substrate, and appears to catalyse the activation step using p-tRNA His and ATP. Thus, it catalyses phosphodiester bond formation at the 5' end of RNAs, formally in a 3'-5' direction [[cite:PUB00020433]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038469", "name" "tRNAHis guanylyltransferase Thg1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF028980" "tRNAHis guanylyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR12729" "TRNA(HIS) GUANYLYLTRANSFERASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNAHis guanylyltransferase Thg1", "short" "tRNAHis_GuaTrfase_Thg1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2722, "taxa" 10279, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6077, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4008}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
