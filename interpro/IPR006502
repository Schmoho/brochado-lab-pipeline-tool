{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PDDEXK_6 is a family of plant proteins that are distant homologues of the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily. The core structure is retained, as α-β-β-β-α-β. It retains the characteristic PDDEXK motifs II and III in modified forms - xDxxx motif located in the second core β-strand, where x is any hydrophobic residue, and a D/E)X(D/N/S/C/G) pattern. The missing positively charged residue in motif III is possibly replaced by a conserved arginine in motif IV located in the proceeding α-helix [[cite:PUB00044133]]. The family is not in general fused with any other domains, so its function cannot be predicted [[cite:PUB00075365]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family of uncharacterised plant proteins are defined by a region found toward the C terminus.
