{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes Beta-ribofuranosylphenol 5'-phosphate synthase (also known as beta-ribofuranosylaminobenzene 5'-phosphate synthase, RFAP synthase) from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and other archaeal species and similar proteins predominantly found in Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes. RFAP synthase is an enzyme involved in methanopterin biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00015321]]. It catalyses the condensation of 4-hydroxybenzoate (HB) with 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to produce beta-ribofuranosylphenol 5'-phosphate (beta-RFH-P) [[cite:PUB00100271]].</p>\n\n<p>In some species, two members of this family are found. It is unclear whether both act as beta-RFAP synthase. This family is related to the GHMP kinases (Galactokinase, Homoserine kinase, Mevalonate kinase, Phosphomevalonate kinase).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8ap0", "name" "ForT Mutant T138V"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004884" "Predicted sugar kinase, GHMP archaeal type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00144" "beta-ribofuranosylaminobenzene 5'-phosphate synthase family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-ribofuranosylphenol 5'-phosphate synthase", "short" "RFAP_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 577, "taxa" 2997, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2960, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2939, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2410}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
