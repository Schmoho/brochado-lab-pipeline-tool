{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are annotated as CitX, containing the CitX domain, the domain is also found in the CitXG bifunctional protein, of the citrate lyase system. CitX transfers the prosthetic group 2'-(5''-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA to the citrate lyase gamma chain, an acyl carrier protein. This enzyme may be designated holo-ACP synthase, holo-citrate lyase synthase, or apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase. In a few genera, including Haemophilus, this protein occurs as a fusion protein with CitG ([ec:2.7.8.25]), an enzyme involved in prosthetic group biosynthesis. This CitX family is easily separated from the holo-ACP synthases of other enzyme systems.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7dcn", "name" "Apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03124" "citrate lyase holo-[acyl-carrier protein] synthase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00398" "Probable apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase [citX]"}, "pfam" {"PF03802" "Apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-CoA transferase", "short" "CitX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 514, "taxa" 3059, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3492, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2767}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0672"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
