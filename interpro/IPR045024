{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of alternative NADH:quinone oxidoreductases (also known as NDH-2) that deliver electrons to the respiratory chain by oxidation of NADH and reduction of quinones but does not pump protons [[cite:PUB00097734]]. NDH-2 have particular relevance in yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in several prokaryotes, whose respiratory chains are devoid of complex I, in which NDH-2 keep the balance and are the main entry point of electrons into the respiratory chains [[cite:PUB00097735]]. Structures of NDH-2 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also called Ndi1 ([pdbe:4G6H] and [pdbe:4G9K]), and those from bacteria, Caldalkalibacillus thermarum ([pdbe:4NWZ]) and Staphylococcus aureus ([pdbe:4XDB7]), have been determined [[cite:PUB00097738]]. Interestingly, since NDH-2s are present only in bacteria and certain plant, fungal and protozoan mitochondria, but not in mammals, they have been used as a drug target for Mycoplasma tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii [[cite:PUB00097739]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5yjw", "name" "Structure of the Ndi1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in complex with the competitive inhibitor, stigmatellin."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43706" "NADH DEHYDROGENASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alternative NADH dehydrogenase", "short" "NDH-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6218, "taxa" 22727, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34972, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34972, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25367}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
