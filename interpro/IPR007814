{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes PaaA and PaaC proteins, which are part of a catabolic pathway of phenylacetic acid [[cite:PUB00010200]]. E. coli PaaA and PaaC are components of 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase multicomponent enzyme system which catalyses the reduction of phenylacetyl-CoA (PA-CoA) to form 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA. PaaA is the catalytic subunit involved in the incorporation of one atom of molecular oxygen into phenylacetyl-CoA, while PaaC may be essential for structural integrity of the alpha subunit [[cite:PUB00055817], [cite:PUB00075378]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1otk", "name" "Structural Genomics, Protein paaC"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05138" "Phenylacetic acid catabolic protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase, subunit A/C", "short" "PaaA_PaaC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 2673, "taxa" 9827, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21384, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16041}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
