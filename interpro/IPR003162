{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human transcription initiation factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) and at least 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that collectively or individually are involved in activator-dependent transcription [[cite:PUB00006329], [cite:PUB00079479], [cite:PUB00014354]].   This entry represents the N terminus of the 31kDa subunit (42kDa in Drosophila) of transcription initiation factor IID (TAFII31), also known as transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 9 (TAF9).  It has been shown that TAF9 interacts directly with different transcription factors such as p53, herpes simplex virus activator vp16 and the basal transcription factor TFIIB. Binding to p53 is an essential requirement for p53 mediated transcription activation.</p>\r\n<p>TAF9 is a component other TBP-free TAF complexes containing the GCN5-type histone acetyltransferase. Several TAFs interact via histone-fold (HFD) motifs; HFD is the interaction motif involved in heterodimerization of the core histones and their assembly into nucleosome octamers. The minimal HFD contains three Î±-helices linked by two loops and is found in core histones, TAFS and many other transcription factors. TFIID has a histone octamer-like substructure. TFIID has a histone octamer-like substructure. TAF9 is a shared subunit of both, histone acetyltransferase complex (SAGA) and TFIID complexes. TAF9 domain interacts with TAF6 to form a novel histone-like heterodimer that is structurally related to the histone H3 and H4 oligomer [[cite:PUB00020401], [cite:PUB00079480], [cite:PUB00079481], [cite:PUB00079569]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1taf", "name" "DROSOPHILA TBP ASSOCIATED FACTORS DTAFII42/DTAFII62 HETEROTETRAMER"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009072", "name" "Histone-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07979" "histone-fold domain found in transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 9 (TAF9) and similar proteins"}, "pfam" {"PF02291" "Transcription initiation factor IID, 31kD subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation factor TAFII31", "short" "TFIID-31"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 39, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 2488, "taxa" 10127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5156, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5137, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2909}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2054", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2054"} {"accession" "GenProp2052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003162", :literature {"PUB00006329" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Hisatake K" "Ohta T" "Takada R" "Guermah M" "Horikoshi M" "Nakatani Y" "Roeder RG."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
