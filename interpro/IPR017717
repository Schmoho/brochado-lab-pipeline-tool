{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are the methionine salvage pathway enzyme 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase, a homologue of RuBisCO [[cite:PUB00080676], [cite:PUB00016716]]. They catalyze the tautomerization of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentane 1-phosphate (DK-MTP 1-P). This is an important step in the methionine salvage pathway in which 5-methylthio-D-ribose (MTR) derived from 5'-methylthioadenosine is converted to methionine. This protein family seems restricted to Bacillus subtilis and close relatives, where two separate proteins carry the enolase and phosphatase activities that in other species occur in a single protein, MtnC ([interpro:IPR023943]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2oem", "name" "Crystal structure of a rubisco-like protein from Geobacillus kaustophilus liganded with Mg2+ and 2,3-diketohexane 1-phosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036376", "name" "Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, large subunit, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00157" "2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase"}, "cdd" {"cd08209" "2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01679" "2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase [mtnW]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03332" "2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase", "short" "Diketo-Methiopentyl-P_enolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 280, "taxa" 1107, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1057, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 775}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0732", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0732"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
