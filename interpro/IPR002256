{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) constitute a family of xenobiotic- metabolising enzymes [[cite:PUB00000158]]. Using an NADPH cofactor and FAD prosthetic group, these microsomal proteins catalyse the oxygenation of nucleophilic nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorous and selenium atoms in a range of structurally diverse compounds. Five mammalian forms of FMO are now known and have been designated FMO1-FMO5 [[cite:PUB00002642], [cite:PUB00002611], [cite:PUB00004772], [cite:PUB00000516], [cite:PUB00002834]]. <p>FMO4 mRNA is present in low abundance in several foetal and adult tissues and the corresponding gene thus appears to be expressed constitutively [[cite:PUB00001464]]. Sequence analysis reveals that FMO4 is 56% identical to FMO3; each is encoded by a single gene [[cite:PUB00002842]]. The deduced amino acid sequence of human FM04 includes the putative FAD- (GxGxxG) and NADP<sup>+</sup>pyrophosphate-binding (GxGxxA) sites characteristic of mammalian FMOs, a 'FATGY' motif that has also been observed in a range of siderphore biosynthetic enzymes [[cite:PUB00005489]], and a C-terminal hydrophobic segment that is believed to anchor the monooxygenase to the microsomal membrane [[cite:PUB00002549]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01124" "FMOXYGENASE4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flavin monooxygenase (FMO) 4", "short" "Flavin_mOase_4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 120, "taxa" 425, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1837, "sets" 0, "proteins" 234, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 153}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
