{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins in which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD is transferred to proteins. This process is responsible for the toxicity of some bacterial toxins (e.g., cholera and pertussis toxins). Mono (ADP-ribosyl) transferases exist in vertebrates [ec:2.4.2.31] that transfer ADP-ribose to arginine [[cite:PUB00002966], [cite:PUB00095656], [cite:PUB00095655]].</p>\n\n<p><reaction>\nNAD<sup>+</sup> + L-arginine = nicotinamide + N2-(ADP-D-ribosyl)-L-arginine\n</reaction></p>\n\n<p>At least five forms of the enzyme have been characterised to date, some of which are attached to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, while others appear to be secreted. The enzymes contain ~250-300 residues, which encode putative signal sequences and carbohydrate attachment sites. In addition, the N- and C-termini are predominantly hydrophobic, a characteristic of GPI-anchored proteins [[cite:PUB00000393]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6dre", "name" "ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin/immunity pair"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS01291" "NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferases signature"}, "pfam" {"PF01129" "NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase"}, "prints" {"PR00970" "RIBTRNSFRASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase, ART", "short" "ART"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 1268, "proteomes" 869, "taxa" 3619, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19078, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18783, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15291}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00993", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00993"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
