{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes ribonuclease Z (RNase Z) and its orthologues, such as RNase BN (also known as elaC) from E.coli. They are ribonucleases that have functions in tRNA-3' processing. RNase Z orthologues are present in all eukaryotes and archaea sequenced so far, and are widely distributed in bacteria [[cite:PUB00083320], [cite:PUB00083319]].</p>\n\n<p>All tRNAs are synthesized as precursor molecules and their maturation to functional tRNAs requires several processing steps. First, the removal of the 5'-leader is catalysed by the endonucleolytic ribozyme RNase P. Second, the removal of the 3'-trailer sequences, which is either a single-step endonucleolytic process or a two-step process involving downstream cleavage by an endonuclease followed by exonucleolytic trimming to generate the mature 3'-end [[cite:PUB00083319]].</p>\n\n<p>The first evidence for the maturation of tRNA 3'-ends by a single endonucleolytic cleavage reaction came from eukaryotes. In these cases, the cleavage of the 3'-end is carried out by RNase Z. In most cases, RNase Z removes the 3'-trailer sequence by cleaving directly after the discriminator nucleotide. Interestingly, the CCA motif present in all mature tRNAs is a general anti-determinant for RNase Z activity. The activity of some RNase Z homologues found in bacterial and archaea have also been shown to be inhibited by the presence of a CCA motif [[cite:PUB00083319]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zwf", "name" "Crystal structure of Human tRNase Z, short form (ELAC1)."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07717" "Ribonuclease Z, E. coli 3' tRNA-processing endonuclease ZiPD and related proteins; MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase domain"}, "hamap" {"MF_01818" "Ribonuclease BN [rbn]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02651" "ribonuclease Z"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease Z/BN", "short" "RNase_Z/BN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5227, "taxa" 21197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20468, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15426}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1360", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1360"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
