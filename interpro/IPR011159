{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents the yeast phosphoprotein phosphatase, Ppz-type. Ppz proteins function in the regulation of K+ transport. Ppz proteins and the Hal3p inhibitory subunit of Ppz1 are important determinants of salt tolerance, cell wall integrity and cell cycle progression, each of which is dependent upon the Trk K+ transporters [[cite:PUB00014802], [cite:PUB00074962]]. The decreased Ppz activity found in Ppz mutants results in the activation of Trk and the subsequent plasma membrane depolarisation (reducing uptake of toxic cations), increased intracellular K+ and turgor (compromising cell integrity), and increased intracellular pH (augmenting the expression of pH-regulated genes and facilitating alpha-factor recovery).
