{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the hamartin protein which is thought to function as a tumour suppressor. The hamartin protein interacts with the tuberin protein [interpro:IPR003913]. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder and is characterised by the presence of hamartomas in many organs, such as brain, skin, heart, lung, and kidney. It is caused by mutation in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes. TSC1 encodes a protein, hamartin, containing two coiled-coil regions, which have been shown to mediate binding to tuberin. The TSC2 gene codes for tuberin [interpro:IPR003913].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04388" "Hamartin protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR15154" "HAMARTIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hamartin", "short" "Hamartin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 35, "proteomes" 1770, "taxa" 6048, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4683, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4056, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2528}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2033"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007483", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007483", "name" "Hamartin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 23, "alignment:full" 2733}}}
