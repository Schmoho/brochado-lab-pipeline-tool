{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The lineage specific VIN3 family of proteins includes VIN3, VIN3-like1-3 (VIL1-3) and similar proteins. They contain a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, and collectively repress different sets of members of the Flowering LOCUS C (FLC) gene family during the course of vernalization [[cite:PUB00096325]]. Both VIN3 and VIL1 are required for modifying the histone architecture of the MADS box floral repressor FLC in response to prolonged cold exposure in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00096332]]. VIN3 is required for both Histone H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) and Histone H3 Lys 27 (H3K27) methylation at FLC chromatin, ultimately leading to its repression. It is regulated by the components of Polycomb Response Complex2 (PRC2), which trimethylates histone H3 Lys 27 (H3K27me3) [[cite:PUB00096327], [cite:PUB00096326]]. VIL1 appears to play a prominent role in regulating FLC by vernalization [[cite:PUB00076963]]. VIL2 acts together with PRC2 to repress the floral repressor MAF5, an FLC clade member, in a photoperiod-dependent manner to accelerate flowering under non-inductive photoperiods [[cite:PUB00096328], [cite:PUB00096329]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7o6u", "name" "Crystal structure of the VIN3 VEL polymerising domain (R554A R556D mutant)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46286" "VIN3-LIKE PROTEIN 2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vernalization insensitive 3-like", "short" "VIN3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 958, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2304, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2304, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1350}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044514", :literature {"PUB00096332" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Zografos BR" "Sung S."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "Vernalization-mediated chromatin changes.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "4343-8", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22685309}, "PUB00076963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Sung S" "Schmitz RJ" "Amasino RM."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1493306", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "A PHD finger protein involved in both the vernalization and photoperiod pathways in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "3244-8", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17114575}, "PUB00096325" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kim DH" "Sung S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Coordination of the vernalization response through a VIN3 and FLC gene family regulatory network in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "454-69", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23417034}, "PUB00096328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kim DH" "Sung S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "title" "Role of VIN3-LIKE 2 in facultative photoperiodic flowering response in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1672-3", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21150261}, "PUB00096326" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Jean Finnegan E" "Bond DM" "Buzas DM" "Goodrich J" "Helliwell CA" "Tamada Y" "Yun JY" "Amasino RM" "Dennis ES."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Polycomb proteins regulate the quantitative induction of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 in response to low temperatures.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "382-91", "volume" "65", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21265892}, "PUB00096327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kim DH" "Zografos BR" "Sung S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Signal Behav", "title" "Mechanisms underlying vernalization-mediated VIN3 induction in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1457-9", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21051939}, "PUB00096329" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Kim DH" "Sung S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "The Plant Homeo Domain finger protein, VIN3-LIKE 2, is necessary for photoperiod-mediated epigenetic regulation of the floral repressor, MAF5.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "17029-34", "volume" "107", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20837520}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010048", "name" "vernalization response", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0040029", "name" "epigenetic regulation of gene expression", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044514", "name" "Vernalization insensitive 3-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
