{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Extensins are plant cell-wall proteins; they can account for up to 20% of the dry weight of the cell wall. They are highly-glycosylated, possibly reflecting their interactions with cell-wall carbohydrates. Amongst their functions is cell wall strengthening in response to mechanical stress (e.g., during attack by pests, plant-bending in the wind, etc.). By contrast with extensin genes, pistil-specific extensin-like genes are not induced under stress conditions. Gene expression is organ-specific and temporally regulated during pistil development. After pollination, transcript levels of pistil-specific extensin-like genes change relative to levels in unpollinated pistils [[cite:PUB00006108]]. The protein sequence is characterised by multiple tandem ser-pro-pro-pro-pro pentapeptide repeats.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01218" "PSTLEXTENSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pistil-specific extensin-like protein", "short" "Pistil_extensin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 630, "taxa" 3480, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5329, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1090}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
