{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents BamHI restriction endonucleases, which recognises the DNA sequence GGATCC and cleaves after G-1 [[cite:PUB00007417], [cite:PUB00024656]]. The enzyme binds as a dimer to the symmetrical GGATCC sequence but it recognises this sequence in an asymmetric manner, in which the C-terminal arm of one BamHI subunit goes into the DNA minor groove while the corresponding region of the other subunit follows the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone [[cite:PUB00022958]]. The BamHI structure consists of a central mixed  β -sheet with α-helices packed on both sides.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also represents the Type II restriction enzyme OkrAI that is isoschizomer of BamHI [[cite:PUB00110633]]. OkrAI is a minimal version of BamHI, lacking the N- and C-terminal helices as well as the internal 3(10) helix of BamHI. Despite these structural differences, OkrAI recognises the DNA in a remarkably similar manner to BamHI [[cite:PUB00110633]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>There are four classes of restriction endonucleases: types I, II,III and IV. All types of enzymes recognise specific short DNA sequences and carry out the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates.

These site-specific deoxyribonucleases catalyse the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates. Of the 3000 restriction endonucleases that have been characterised, most are homodimeric or tetrameric enzymes that cleave target DNA at sequence-specific sites close to the recognition site. For homodimeric enzymes, the recognition site is usually a palindromic sequence 4-8 bp in length. Most enzymes require magnesium ions as a cofactor for catalysis. Although they can vary in their mode of recognition, many restriction endonucleases share a similar structural core comprising four β-strands and one α-helix, as well as a similar mechanism of cleavage, suggesting a common ancestral origin [[cite:PUB00035691]].  However, there is still considerable diversity amongst restriction endonucleases [[cite:PUB00035692], [cite:PUB00035693]]. The target site recognition process triggers large conformational changes of the enzyme and the target DNA, leading to the activation of the catalytic centres. Like other DNA binding proteins, restriction enzymes are capable of non-specific DNA binding as well, which is the prerequisite for efficient target site location by facilitated diffusion. Non-specific binding usually does not involve interactions with the bases but only with the DNA backbone [[cite:PUB00035694]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bam", "name" "RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASE BAMHI COMPLEX WITH DNA AND MANGANESE IONS (POST-REACTIVE COMPLEX)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011335", "name" "Restriction endonuclease type II-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011338", "name" "Restriction endonuclease, type II, BamHI/BglIII/BstY", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF009309" "Type II restriction endonuclease, BamHI type"}, "pfam" {"PF02923" "Restriction endonuclease BamHI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Restriction endonuclease, type II, BamHI", "short" "Restrct_endonuc_II_BamHI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 50, "taxa" 575, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 217, "sets" 0, "proteins" 210, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 157}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
