{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family occur strictly in the genus Mycoplasma, average 1050 in length with little length variability, have an N-terminal signal sequence, and exhibit no detectable sequence similarity to any characterised protein. Up to four tandem copies occur in some Mycoplasma (e.g. M. putrefaciens KS1). Incorrect inclusion of a 57-amino acid stretch of one family member in [interpro:IPR012563], for a helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator in several E. coli phage, has caused many members of this family to be annotated, in error, as GnsA/GnsB family proteins. The name STREFT (Secreted Thousand Residue Frequently Tandem) protein was suggested by TIGRfam as a distinctive name to spread and replace the incorrect GnsA/GnsB designation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04512" "STREFT protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "STREFT protein", "short" "Mycopla_NOT_gsn"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 34, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 52, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030962", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030962", "name" "STREFT protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
