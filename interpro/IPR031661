{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), also known as Bbc3 (Bcl-2-binding component 3), is a critical mediator of p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis [[cite:PUB00075983]]. PUMA transduces death signals primarily to the mitochondria. It is induced in cells after p53 activation. It binds to Bcl-2, localises to the mitochondria to induce cytochrome c release, and activates the rapid induction of apoptosis [[cite:PUB00075982]]. PUMA is capable of inhibiting all the five major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W and A1) [[cite:PUB00075983]]. The binding of PUMA to the inhibitory members of the Bcl-2 family via its BH3 domain results in the displacement of the proteins Bax and/or Bak, and seems to be a critical regulatory step in the induction of apoptosis [[cite:PUB00075984]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vof", "name" "Structure of mouse A1 bound to the Puma BH3-domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28639" "BCL-2-BINDING COMPONENT 3"}, "pfam" {"PF15826" "Bcl-2-binding component 3, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bcl-2-binding component 3", "short" "Bbc3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 143, "taxa" 568, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 287, "sets" 0, "proteins" 275, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 169}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031661", :literature {"PUB00075982" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Nakano K" "Vousden KH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
