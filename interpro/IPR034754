{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GEMIN8 proteins are found in the nuclear bodies called gems (Gemini of Cajal bodies) that are often in proximity to Cajal (coiled) bodies themselves. They are also found in the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00084307]]. The family is part of the SMN (survival motor neurone) complex that plays an essential role in spliceosomal snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm and is required for pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus.
