{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are ATP-grasp family enzymes related to a number of characterised glutamate ligases, including the ribosomal protein S6 modification enzyme RimK. This group belongs to a conserved gene neighbourhood that also features an HPr kinase-related protein.
