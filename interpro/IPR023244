{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Brefeldin is a lactone antibiotic produced by fungi such as Eupenicillum brefeldianum. It both inhibits protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, and induces retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, leading to protein accumulation within the ER. Screening of a deletion-strain collection for mutants sensitive or resistant to drugs that affect intracellular transport has revealed a number of mutants sensitive to brefeldin A: e.g., deletion of the BRE4 gene was shown to result in brefeldin A-sensitivity [[cite:PUB00019467]]. The BRE4 gene product is predicted to contain 10 transmembrane (TM) domains, suggesting that it is likely to be an integral membrane protein, potentially involved in intracellular vesicle transport [[cite:PUB00019467]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02047" "Brefeldin A-sensitivity protein 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Brefeldin A-sensitivity protein 4", "short" "Brefeldin_A-sensitivity_4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 752, "taxa" 2085, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11102, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1558, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 905}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023244", :literature {"PUB00019467" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Muren E" "Oyen M" "Barmark G" "Ronne H."], "ISO_journal" "Yeast", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1097-0061(20010130)18:2<163::AID-YEA659>3.0.CO;2-#", "medline_journal" "Yeast", "title" "Identification of yeast deletion strains that are hypersensitive to brefeldin A or monensin, two drugs that affect intracellular transport.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "163-72", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11169758}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023244", "name" "Brefeldin A-sensitivity protein 4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
