{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The OEP family (Outer membrane efflux protein) form trimeric channels that allow export of a variety of substrates in Gram-negative bacteria. Each member of this family is composed of two repeats. The trimeric channel is composed of a 12\nstranded all Î² sheet barrel that spans the outer membrane, and a long all helical barrel that spans the periplasm. Examples include the Escherichia coli TolC outer membrane protein, which is required for proper expression of outer membrane protein genes; the Rhizobium nodulation protein; and the Pseudomonas FusA protein, which is involved in resistance to fusaric acid.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1yc9", "name" "The crystal structure of the outer membrane protein VceC from the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae at 1.8 resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02321" "Outer membrane efflux protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Outer membrane efflux protein", "short" "OMP_efflux"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 398, "proteomes" 5704, "taxa" 24763, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 403264, "sets" 0, "proteins" 215088, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 162775}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003423", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015562", "name" "efflux transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0055085", "name" "transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003423", "name" "Outer membrane efflux protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR010130", "name" "Type I secretion outer membrane protein, TolC", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR010131", "name" "RND efflux system, outer membrane lipoprotein, NodT", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR028351", "name" "Cyclolysin transport protein CyaE", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 109, "alignment:full" 82881}}}
