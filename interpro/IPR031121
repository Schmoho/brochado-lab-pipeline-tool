{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of KH domain containing proteins from eukaryotes, including RIK (rough sheath 2-interacting KH domain) from plants and BLOM7 (also known as KH homology domain-containing protein 4, KHDC4) from animals. KHDC4 is an RNA-binding protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with the PRP19C/Prp19 complex/NTC/Nineteen complex which is part of the spliceosome. KHDC4 binds preferentially RNA with A/C rich sequences and poly-C stretches. KHDC4 contains two type I K homology (KH) RNA-binding domains [[cite:PUB00086865], [cite:PUB00086864]].</p>\n\n<p>RIK1 interacts with rough sheath2 (RS2), which is a myb domain protein required to repress knox genes during leaf development [[cite:PUB00074396]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15744" "BLOM7"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "KH domain containing protein RIK/BLOM7", "short" "RIK/BLOM7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2090, "taxa" 7080, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4372, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4372, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2739}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031121", :literature {"PUB00074396" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Phelps-Durr TL" "Thomas J" "Vahab P" "Timmermans MC."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.035477", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Maize rough sheath2 and its Arabidopsis orthologue ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 interact with HIRA, a predicted histone chaperone, to maintain knox gene silencing and determinacy during organogenesis.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2886-98", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16243907}, "PUB00086864" {"URL" nil, "issue" "42", "authors" ["Grillari J" "Loscher M" "Denegri M" "Lee K" "Fortschegger K" "Eisenhaber F" "Ajuh P" "Lamond AI" "Katinger H" "Grillari-Voglauer R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
