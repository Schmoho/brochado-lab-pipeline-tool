{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the GTP-binding protein BipA or TypA (Tyrosine phosphorylated protein A (TypA), also known as 50S ribosomal subunit assembly factor BipA) from bacteria and its homologue from Arabidopsis (putative elongation factor TypA-like SVR3). BipA is a 50S ribosomal subunit assembly protein with GTPase activity, required for 50S subunit assembly at low temperatures, also functions as a translation factor that is required specifically for the expression of the transcriptional modulator Fis. BipA binds the 70S ribosome at a site that coincides with that of EF-G and has a GTPase activity that is sensitive to high GDP:GTP ratios and is stimulated by 70S ribosomes programmed with mRNA and aminoacylated tRNAs [[cite:PUB00101695], [cite:PUB00101694]]. The growth rate-dependent induction of BipA allows the efficient expression of Fis, thereby modulating a range of downstream processes, including DNA metabolism and type III secretion. This GTPase impacts interactions between enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC) and epithelial cells and also has an effect on motility [[cite:PUB00043024]]. It appears to be involved in the regulation of several processes important for infection, including rearrangements of the cytoskeleton of the host, bacterial resistance to host defence peptides, flagellum-mediated cell motility, and expression of K5 capsular genes [[cite:PUB00085803], [cite:PUB00092580]].</p>\n\n<p>TypA-like SVR3 is a putative chloroplastic elongation factor involved in response to chilling stress. It is required for proper chloroplast rRNA processing and/or translation at low temperature [[cite:PUB00101692]] and it is also involved in plastid protein homeostasis [[cite:PUB00101693]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042116", "name" "GTP-binding protein TypA/BipA, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00849" "Large ribosomal subunit assembly factor BipA [bipA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01394" "translational GTPase TypA/BipA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GTP-binding protein BipA", "short" "BipA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9205, "taxa" 35344, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37038, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37038, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28253}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
