{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the ORF8b accessory protein from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and related merbecoviruses (C lineage). The gene encoding ORF8b is an internal ORF that is overlapped by the N (nucleocapsid) protein gene (ORF8a) [[cite:PUB00095858]]. ORF8b appear to have no homologous proteins in Sarbecovirus (lineage B), which includes Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV). MERS-CoV ORF8b is not essential for viral replication. It is related to protein I (also known as accessory protein N2) of bovine enteritic coronavirus-F15 strain (BECV-F15) and other related Embecoviruses; the gene encoding protein I is included in the N gene as an alternative ORF [[cite:PUB00095858], [cite:PUB00095863], [cite:PUB00095861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21661" "MERS-CoV ORF8b protein and related Merbecovirus proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MERS-CoV ORF8b protein-like", "short" "merbe_CoV_ORF8b-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 30, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 66, "sets" 0, "proteins" 66, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044312", :literature {"PUB00095861" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wu Z" "Yang L" "Ren X" "He G" "Zhang J" "Yang J" "Qian Z" "Dong J" "Sun L" "Zhu Y" "Du J" "Yang F" "Zhang S" "Jin Q."], "ISO_journal" "ISME J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "ISME J", "title" "Deciphering the bat virome catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "609-20", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26262818}, "PUB00095863" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["van Boheemen S" "de Graaf M" "Lauber C" "Bestebroer TM" "Raj VS" "Zaki AM" "Osterhaus AD" "Haagmans BL" "Gorbalenya AE" "Snijder EJ" "Fouchier RA."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Genomic characterization of a newly discovered coronavirus associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23170002}, "PUB00095858" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wu Z" "Yang L" "Ren X" "Zhang J" "Yang F" "Zhang S" "Jin Q."], "ISO_journal" "J Infect Dis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Infect Dis", "title" "ORF8-Related Genetic Evidence for Chinese Horseshoe Bats as the Source of Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "579-83", "volume" "213", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26433221}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044312", "name" "MERS-CoV ORF8b protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
