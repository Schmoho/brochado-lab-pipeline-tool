{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glycoprotein UL40 from Human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5) (Human herpesvirus 5). HHV-5 has evolved mechanisms to interfere with a host's immune recognition, including targeting antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules. The signal sequence of the HHV-5 encoded UL40 polypeptide contains an HLA-E ligand identical with HLA-Cw*0304. The first 37 residues of UL40, including this ligand, are predicted to encode a signal peptide. The virus thus prevents the lysis by NK (natural killer) cells of the cell it has invaded [[cite:PUB00044525]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10682" "Glycoprotein of human cytomegalovirus HHV-5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL40", "short" "Herpes_UL40"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 19, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 230, "sets" 0, "proteins" 230, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019624", :literature {"PUB00044525" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Ulbrecht M" "Martinozzi S" "Grzeschik M" "Hengel H" "Ellwart JW" "Pla M" "Weiss EH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
