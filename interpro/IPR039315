{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In bacterial chemotaxis, cellular movement is directed in response to chemical gradients. Transmembrane chemoreceptors that sense the stimuli are coupled via coupling protein CheW with a signal transduction histidine kinase (CheA) [[cite:PUB00027767], [cite:PUB00027751]]. CheA phosphorylates response regulators CheB and CheY. The two cytoplasmic proteins, CheW and CheA, both contain homologous SH3-like domains that interact with transmembrane chemoreceptors, or methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). CheV is a third type of protein with a CheW-like domain.</p>\n\n<p>In Bacillus subtilis, CheW and CheV may be partially redundant in coupling the receptors to CheA; however, they are both necessary for efficient chemotaxis [[cite:PUB00027795]]. CheV is phosphorylated in vitro on a conserved aspartate as a result of phosphoryl group transfer from phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P). This reaction is slower compared with the phospho-transfer reaction between CheA-P and one other response regulator of the system, CheB. It is part of a signal transduction pathway to facilitate adaptation to attractants [[cite:PUB00018324]]. In Helicobacter pylori, CheV paralogues and CheW are not redundant and seem to have separate roles in chemotaxis [[cite:PUB00027785]].  CheV is a two-domain protein with an N-terminal CheW-like (SH3-like) domain and a C-terminal CheY-like receiver domain. It is often regarded as a version of CheW, where the CheW-like domain is fused to the receiver domain [[cite:PUB00011107]].</p>\n\n<p>This group contains chemotaxis response regulator proteins CheW.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036061", "name" "CheW-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22617" "CHEMOTAXIS SENSOR HISTIDINE KINASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chemotaxis protein CheW", "short" "CheW"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4652, "taxa" 19638, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 45485, "sets" 0, "proteins" 45485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35504}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039315", :literature {"PUB00018324" {"URL" nil, "issue" "47", "authors" ["Karatan E" "Saulmon MM" "Bunn MW" "Ordal GW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
