{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subfamily of endonucleases containing the N-terminal endo/excinuclease amino terminal domain, [interpro:IPR000305]. Sequences containing this domain are often termed often termed GIY-YIG endonucleases after a conserved sequence motif. The sequences are encoded by open reading frames found in group I introns in both phage and mitochondria. The closely related endonucleases of Bacteriophage T4: segA, segB, segC, segD and segE, are not included in this family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I-TevI ([swissprot:P13299]) from Bacteriophage T4 consists of an N-terminal catalytic GIY-YIG domain, a flexible linker region and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00017038], [cite:PUB00017039]]. The GIY-YIG domain forms a novel α/β fold, with the putative catalytic residues and a putative metal-binding site located on a concave surface. The C-terminal DNA-binding region forms three subdomains - a zinc-finger, a DNA minor-groove binding α helix and a helix-turn helix region. Multiple DNA-protein contacts over an extended region of the DNA substrate molecule are thought to contribute to the high site specificity of this protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mk0", "name" "catalytic domain of intron endonuclease I-TevI, E75A mutant"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01453" "group I intron endonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intron endonuclease, group I", "short" "Intron_endoG1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 281, "taxa" 2878, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2870, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2838, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1704}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006350", :literature {"PUB00017038" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Van Roey P" "Meehan L" "Kowalski JC" "Belfort M" "Derbyshire V."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
