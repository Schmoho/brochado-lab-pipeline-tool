{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes catalyse the deimination of the guanidino group from carboxy-terminal arginine residues of various peptides to produce ammonia. PAD from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis) (PPAD) appears to be evolutionarily unrelated to mammalian PAD ([interpro:IPR004303]), which is a metalloenzyme. PPAD is thought to belong to the same superfamily as aminotransferase and arginine deiminase, and to form an α/β propeller structure. This family has previously been named PPADH (Porphyromonas peptidyl-arginine deiminase homologues) [[cite:PUB00009967]]. The predicted catalytic residues in PPAD ([swissprot:Q9RQJ2]) are Asp130, Asp187, His236, Asp238 and Cys351 [[cite:PUB00009967]]. These are absolutely conserved with the exception of Asp187 which is absent in two family members. PPAD is also able to catalyse the deimination of free L-arginine, but has primarily peptidyl-arginine specificity. It may have a FMN cofactor [[cite:PUB00009968]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nib", "name" "Crystal Structure of Medicago truncatula Agmatine Iminohydrolase (Deiminase)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31377" "AGMATINE DEIMINASE-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF04371" "Porphyromonas-type peptidyl-arginine deiminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidyl-arginine deiminase, Porphyromonas-type", "short" "Peptidyl-Arg-deiminase_porph"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 112, "proteomes" 3994, "taxa" 16373, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21744, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21643, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15902}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1431", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1431"} {"accession" "GenProp1733", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1733"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
