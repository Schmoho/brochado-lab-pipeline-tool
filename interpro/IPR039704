{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Myogenic factors are involved in muscle differentiation, inducing fibroblasts to differentiate into myoblasts.  Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) is responsible for directing cells to the skeletal myocyte lineage during development [[cite:PUB00075517]]. Myf5 and Myod (myoblast determination protein 1) are predominantly expressed in proliferating myoblasts while Myf4 and Myf6 are involved in differentiation of myotubes [[cite:PUB00090005]].  Myogenin (MYOG) is a transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation, cell cycle exit and muscle atrophy [[cite:PUB00090006], [cite:PUB00075518]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11534" "MYOGENIC FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myogenic factor", "short" "Myogenic_factor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 946, "taxa" 3794, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4009, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4009, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2870}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039704", :literature {"PUB00075518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Londhe P" "Davie JK."], "ISO_journal" "Skelet Muscle", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2044-5040-1-14", "medline_journal" "Skelet Muscle", "title" "Sequential association of myogenic regulatory factors and E proteins at muscle-specific genes.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "14", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21798092}, "PUB00075517" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ye HQ" "Chen SL" "Xu JY."], "ISO_journal" "Comp.
