{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Laccases are multi-copper oxidoreductases able to oxidise a wide variety of phenolic and non-phenolic compounds and are widely distributed among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

They may constitute a new laccase subfamily, as they lack sequence relatedness to known laccases [[cite:PUB00044734]]. This family also includes laccase domain-containing protein 1 (Lacc1, FAMIN), which is thought to be a central regulator of immunometabolic function in humans [[cite:PUB00086031], [cite:PUB00086032]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1rw0", "name" "Crystal structure of protein yfiH from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Pfam DUF152"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011324", "name" "Cytotoxic necrotizing factor-like, catalytic", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038371", "name" "Multi-copper polyphenol oxidoreductase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16833" "protein of unknown function YfiH"}, "panther" {"PTHR30616" "UNCHARACTERIZED PROTEIN YFIH"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00726" "peptidoglycan editing factor PgeF"}, "pfam" {"PF02578" "Multi-copper polyphenol oxidoreductase laccase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Multi-copper polyphenol oxidoreductase", "short" "Cu_polyphenol_OxRdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 51, "proteomes" 7846, "taxa" 30575, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34376, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34365, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26116}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
