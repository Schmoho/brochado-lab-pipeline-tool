{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and related proteins comprise the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-2 proteins are central regulators of caspase activation, and play a key role in cell death by regulating the integrity of the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes [[cite:PUB00017301]]. Though originally characterised with respect to their roles in controlling outer mitochondrial membrane integrity and apoptosis, the members of the Bcl-2 family are involved in numerous cellular pathways [[cite:PUB00060365]].</p>\n\n<p>Bcl-2 and its relatives are functionally classified as either antiapoptotic or proapoptotic. All members contain at least one of four conserved motifs, termed Bcl-2 Homology (BH) domains. Antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins contain four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-4). The major antiapoptotic proteins are Bcl-2-related gene A1 (A1), Bcl-2, Bcl-2-related gene, long isoform (Bcl-xL), Bcl-w, and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1). They preserve outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) integrity by directly inhibiting the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [[cite:PUB00060365]].</p>\n\n<p>The proapoptotic Bcl-2 members are divided into the effector proteins and the BH3-only proteins. The effector proteins Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (BAK) and Bcl-2-associated x protein (BAX) were originally described to contain only BH1-3; however, structure-based alignments revealed a conserved BH4 motif [[cite:PUB00049899]]. Upon activation BAK and BAX homo-oligomerise into proteolipid pores within the OMM to promote MOMP (mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation). The BH3-only proteins function in distinct cellular stress scenarios and are subdivided based on their ability to interact with the antiapoptotic or both the antiapoptotic and the effector proteins [[cite:PUB00060365]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the Bcl2 family and related proteins, including E1B 19K protein (also known as E1B protein, small T-antigen), which is a putative adenovirus Bcl-2 homologue that inhibits E1A induced apoptosis and hence prolongs the viability of the host cell.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6uxq", "name" "Crystal structure of BAK core domain BH3-groove-dimer in complex with POPC and C8E4"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036834", "name" "Bcl-2-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS50062" "BCL2-like apoptosis inhibitors family profile"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bcl2-like", "short" "Bcl2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 428, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1099, "taxa" 4862, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11209, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7057}, "pathways" 47}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00829", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00829"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
