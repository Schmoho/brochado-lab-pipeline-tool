{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ectopic expression of vesicular, over-expressed in cancer, pro-survival protein 1, VOPP1 (also known as WW domain binding protein VOPP1) increases NF-kappaB transcriptional activity [[cite:PUB00060255]]. This is achieved by promoting nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Ecop-induced NF-kappaB activation confers cellular resistance to apoptotic challenge [[cite:PUB00060255]]. It is believed that ECop is a key regulator of NF-kappaB signalling, and that high-level, amplification-mediated ECop expression, such as occurs in tumours with amplified EGFR, may contribute to resistance to apoptosis [[cite:PUB00060255]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14971" "VESICULAR, OVEREXPRESSED IN CANCER, PROSURVIVAL PROTEIN 1"}, "prints" {"PR02068" "Vesicular, over-expressed in cancer, pro-survival protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesicular, overexpressed in cancer, prosurvival protein 1", "short" "VOPP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 764, "taxa" 3026, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1575, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1540, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1009}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026229", :literature {"PUB00060255" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Park S" "James CD."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1208496", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "ECop (EGFR-coamplified and overexpressed protein), a novel protein, regulates NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and associated apoptotic response in an IkappaBalpha-dependent manner.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2495-502", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15735698}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030659", "name" "cytoplasmic vesicle membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026229", "name" "Vesicular, overexpressed in cancer, prosurvival protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
