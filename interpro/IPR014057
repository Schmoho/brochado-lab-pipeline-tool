{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this bacterial protein family are small, at roughly 100 amino acids. The gene is almost invariably the downstream member of a gene pair. It is a predicted DNA-binding protein from a clade within the helix-turn-helix family. These gene pairs, when found on the bacterial chromosome, are located often with prophage regions, but also both in integrated plasmid regions and in housekeeping gene regions. Analysis suggests that the gene pair may serve as an addiction module.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010982", "name" "Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21716" "Probable addiction module antidote protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR40275" "SSL7038 PROTEIN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02684" "addiction module antidote protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterized protein HI1420", "short" "HI1420"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 1095, "taxa" 7118, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8710, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8692, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6729}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0471", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0471"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014057", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014057", "name" "Uncharacterized protein HI1420", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 1584}}}
