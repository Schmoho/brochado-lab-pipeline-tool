{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from actinomycetes and firmicutes, including Fimbrial subunit type 1 (FMI1) from Actinomyces viscosus and FMI2 from Actinomyces naeslundii. Members of this family are pilin major subunits whose structure includes an LPXTG motif-containing signal near the C terminus, for processing by sortases. Most contain a recognisable D2-type fimbrial isopeptide formation domain ([interpro:IPR026466]), in which Lys-to-Asn isopeptide bond formation provides additional structural integrity to support adhesion despite shear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hr6", "name" "Structure of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae major pilin SpaA points to a modular pilus assembly stabilizing isopeptide bonds"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033902" "SpaH/EbpB family LPXTG-anchored major pilin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fimbrial subunit type 1-like", "short" "FM1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 444, "taxa" 1744, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2831, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2806, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2146}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048052", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048052", "name" "Fimbrial subunit type 1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
