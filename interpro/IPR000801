{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains several seemingly unrelated proteins, including human esterase D [ec:3.1.2.12]; mycobacterial antigen 85 [[cite:PUB00024304]], which is responsible for the high affinity of mycobacteria to fibronectin; Corynebacterium glutamicum major secreted protein PS1; and a number of proteins from Escherichia coli, yeast, mycobacteria and Haemophilus influenzae. Proteins in this entry share the typical AB hydrolase fold including esterases with broad specificity. Among them, S-formylglutathione hydrolases, such as YeiG and FrmB from bacteria [ec:3.1.2.12]; the three related serine hydrolases Iron(III) enterobactin esterase fes ([ec:3.1.1.108]), Iron(III) salmochelin esterase iroD ([ec:3.1.1.109]) and iroE ([ec:3.1.1.107]) from E. coli which are esterases for the apo and Fe3-bound forms of enterobactin iroB  [[cite:PUB00097189], [cite:PUB00041225]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dqz", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ANTIGEN 85C FROM MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00756" "Putative esterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Esterase-like", "short" "Esterase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 93, "domain_architectures" 687, "proteomes" 9518, "taxa" 35303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 95361, "sets" 0, "proteins" 94277, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 70709}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1578", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1578"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
