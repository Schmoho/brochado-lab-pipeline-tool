{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this entry represent PfaA, which is involved in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, for example PfaA from the eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis operon in Photobacterium profundum SS9. PfaA is found together with PfaB, PfaC, and PfaD, and the functions of the individual polypeptides have not yet been described. More distant homologues of PfaA, also included in this entry, appear to be involved in polyketide-like biosynthetic mechanisms of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis; an alternative to the more familiar iterated mechanism of chain extension and desaturation, and like PfaA the more distant homologues are likewise found near genes for homologues of PfaB, PfaC, and/or PfaD.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02813" "polyketide-type polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase PfaA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyketide-type polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase, PfaA", "short" "Omega_3_polyunsat_FA_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 151, "taxa" 925, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 777, "sets" 0, "proteins" 692, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 53}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004432", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004432", "name" "Polyketide-type polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase, PfaA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
