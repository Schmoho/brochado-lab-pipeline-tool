{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate phosphatase, MtnX,  which is involved in methionine salvage and belongs to the HAD-superfamily hydrolases, subfamily IB [[cite:PUB00047443]]. This enzyme is found in Bacillus subtilis and related species, paired with MtnW ([interpro:IPR017717]). In most species that recycle methionine from methylthioadenosine, the single protein MtnC replaces the MtnW/MtnX pair. In B. subtilis, mtnX was first known as ykrX.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2fea", "name" "Crystal structure of MtnX phosphatase from Bacillus Subtilis at 2.00 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01680" "2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate phosphatase [mtnX]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03333" "2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate phosphatase", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IB_MtnX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 279, "taxa" 999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1017, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1017, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 753}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0732", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0732"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
