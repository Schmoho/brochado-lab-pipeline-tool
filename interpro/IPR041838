{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arf6 (ADP ribosylation factor 6) proteins localize to the plasma membrane, where they perform a wide variety of functions. In its active, GTP-bound form, Arf6 is involved in cell spreading, Rac-induced formation of plasma membrane ruffles, cell migration, wound healing, and Fc-mediated phagocytosis. Arf6 appears to change the actin structure at the plasma membrane by activating Rac, a Rho family protein involved in membrane ruffling. Arf6 is required for and enhances Rac formation of ruffles. Arf6 can regulate dendritic branching in hippocampal neurons, and in yeast it localizes to the growing bud, where it plays a role in polarized growth and bud site selection. In leukocytes, Arf6 is required for chemokine-stimulated migration across endothelial cells. Arf6 also plays a role in down-regulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors and luteinizing hormone receptors by facilitating the release of sequestered arrestin to allow endocytosis. Arf6 is believed to function at multiple sites on the plasma membrane through interaction with a specific set of GEFs, GAPs, and effectors [[cite:PUB00091929]]. Arf6 has been implicated in breast cancer and melanoma cell invasion [[cite:PUB00091930], [cite:PUB00091931]], and in actin remodelling at the invasion site of Chlamydia infection [[cite:PUB00091932]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's worth noting that the Arf6 homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known as Arf3 [[cite:PUB00091928]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n5c", "name" "Crystal Structure of Arf6DELTA13 complexed with GDP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04149" "ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor 6", "short" "Arf6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1745, "taxa" 5973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2544, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1632}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
