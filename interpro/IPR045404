{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of phage capsid/coat-related proteins, including Gp13 from Bacillus phage SPP1. The characteristics of the protein distribution suggest prophage matches in addition to the phage matches. Gp13 is part of the icosahedral capsid together with the auxiliary protein gp12, which are organized in a T=7 lattice [[cite:PUB00080982]]. This family contains some conserved motifs: GD, GxxxxV/IxxD and NW.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20036" "Major capsid protein 13-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major capsid protein 13-like", "short" "Gp13-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 266, "taxa" 1972, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1436, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1436, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 729}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045404", :literature {"PUB00080982" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["White HE" "Sherman MB" "Brasiles S" "Jacquet E" "Seavers P" "Tavares P" "Orlova EV."], "ISO_journal" "J.
