{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents aldo-keto reductase family 3B (AKR3B), including NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase 1 (ARI) from Sporidiobolus salmonicolor and D/L-glyceraldehyde reductase (GLD1) from Hypocrea jecorina. Sporidiobolus salmonicolor ARI catalyses the asymmetric reduction of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones to an R-enantiomer. It reduces ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate [[cite:PUB00096125], [cite:PUB00096126]]. GLD1 mediates the conversion of L-glyceraldehyde to glycerol in D-galacturonate catabolic process [[cite:PUB00096124]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In general, the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) protein superfamily members reduce carbonyl substrates such as: sugar aldehydes, keto-steroids, keto-prostaglandins, retinals, quinones, and lipid peroxidation by-products [[cite:PUB00002548], [cite:PUB00096110]]. However, there are some exceptions, such as the reduction of steroid double bonds catalysed by AKR1D enzymes (5beta-reductases); and the oxidation of proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; while the beta-subunits of potassium gated ion channels (AKR6 family) control Kv channel opening [[cite:PUB00096110]].</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, they contain an (α/β)8-barrel motif, display large loops at the back of the barrel which govern substrate specificity, and have a conserved cofactor binding domain. The binding site is located in a large, deep, elliptical pocket in the C-terminal end of the β-sheet, the substrate being bound in an extended conformation. The hydrophobic nature of the pocket favours aromatic and apolar substrates over highly polar ones [[cite:PUB00005156]]. They catalyse an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which NAD(P)H cofactor binds first and leaves last [[cite:PUB00096110]]. Binding of the NADPH coenzyme causes a massive conformational change, reorienting a loop, effectively locking the coenzyme in place. This binding is more similar to FAD- than to NAD(P)-binding oxidoreductases [[cite:PUB00002751]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036812", "name" "NADP-dependent oxidoreductase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd19118" "AKR3B family of aldo-keto reductase (AKR)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aldo-keto reductase family 3B", "short" "AKR3B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 24, "taxa" 115, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
