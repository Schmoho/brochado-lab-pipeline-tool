{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family represents MXAN_6627.5 and similar sequences from Myxococcales. MXAN_6627.5 is a MYXO-CTERM protein, depending on myxosortase and type II secretion for expression presumably on the cell surface. This protein is encoded between loci MXAN_6627 and MXAN_6628, but missed in previous annotation of that genome. The central region of the protein has four invariant Cys residues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041937" "MXAN_6627.5 family MYXO-CTERM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MXAN_6627.5-like", "short" "MXAN_6627.5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 75, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 52}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049656", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049656", "name" "MXAN_6627.5-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
