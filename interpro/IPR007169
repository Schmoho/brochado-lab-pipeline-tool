{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of mostly uncharacterized proteins includes the extracellular matrix regulatory protein A (RemA) from<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. RemA is required for biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix and biofilm formation [[cite:PUB00089811], [cite:PUB00100525]]. It binds to DNA at multiple sites upstream of the promoters of the operons eps and tapA-sipW-tasA, which are required for the synthesis of the extracellular matrix components, extracellular polysaccharide and TasA amyloid proteins.  SinR negatively regulates eps operon expression by occluding RemA binding [[cite:PUB00089811]]. Structure of RemA homologue from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans revealed that it forms an unique octameric ring with the potential to form a 16-meric superstructure and suggests that RemA can wrap DNA around its ring-like structure [[cite:PUB00100525]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7p1w", "name" "Crystal structure of a R51 R53 double mutant of the DNA-binding protein RemA from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04025" "Extracellular matrix regulatory protein A-like"}, "panther" {"PTHR38449" "REGULATORY PROTEIN TM_1690-RELATED"}, "hamap" {"MF_01503" "Putative regulatory protein <locus_tag>"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Extracellular matrix regulatory protein A-like", "short" "RemA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 1440, "taxa" 6042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7753, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7748, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5798}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007169", :literature {"PUB00100525" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hoffmann T" "Mrusek D" "Bedrunka P" "Burchert F" "Mais CN" "Kearns DB" "Altegoer F" "Bremer E" "Bange G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structural and functional characterization of the bacterial biofilm activator RemA.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "5707", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34588455}, "PUB00089811" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Winkelman JT" "Bree AC" "Bate AR" "Eichenberger P" "Gourse RL" "Kearns DB."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
