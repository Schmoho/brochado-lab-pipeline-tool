{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MJ_1101 protein from Methanococcus jannaschii has been characterised as the GlmU, a bifunctional enzyme (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase/glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) catalyzing the final two steps of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00054937]].  Homologues of this enzyme are identified in a number of bacterial organisms.  A number of these are observed in proximity to the glmS and glmM genes, and phylogenetic profiling [[cite:PUB00034422]] identifies the LEPBI_I0518 gene in Leptospira biflexa as a likely Glm-system candidate.  There are significant structural differences between these bacterial homologues with their archaeal counterparts represented by [ncbifam:TIGR03992].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03991" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase/glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase"}, "pfam" {"PF13562" "Sugar nucleotidyl transferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-GlcNAc diphosphorylase/GlcNAc-1-P N-acetyltransferase, GlmU, bacterial-type", "short" "Bifunctiontional_GlmU_bac-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 968, "taxa" 3865, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5051, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4977, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3764}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0750", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0750"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023917", :literature {"PUB00054937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Namboori SC" "Graham DE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
