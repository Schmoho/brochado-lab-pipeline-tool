{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A member of this family has been identified in Staphylococcus aureus as a dehydrogenase involved in the synthesis of a new opine metallophore, named staphylopine. It is encoded as part of an operon that also includes an histidine racemase and an enzyme distantly related to nicotianamine synthase [[cite:PUB00081137]]. Staphylopine is involved in metal acquisition, chelating nickel, cobalt, zinc, copper or iron, depending on the growing conditions. Metal acquisition is vital for bacteria growing in metal-scarce environments, such as inside a host in the case of pathogens.</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes similar synthases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia pestis, which catalyse the final step in the biosynthesis of pseudopaline and yersinopine, respectively [[cite:PUB00092873]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6c4m", "name" "Yersinopine dehydrogenase (YpODH) - NADP+ bound"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10100" "Staphylopine dehydrogenase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029692" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP029692 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Opine metallophore dehydrogenase", "short" "Opine_metallophore_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 72, "taxa" 462, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 376, "sets" 0, "proteins" 376, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 293}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
