{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>tRNA (guanosine(18)-2'-O)-methyltransferase (also known as tRNA [Gm18] methyltransferase, and TrmH) catalyses the 2'-O methylation of guanosine at position 18 (Gua18) in the D loop of tRNA [[cite:PUB00031978]]. In the reaction, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) functions as a methyl group donor and is converted to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy). The methylation of tRNA nucleotides helps to stabilize the L-shaped tRNA structure and improve their molecular recognition [[cite:PUB00079974]].</p>\r\n<p>TrmH enzymes can be classified into two types based on their substrate tRNA specificity. Type I TrmH, which includes Thermus thermophilus TrmH, can modify all tRNA species. Type II TrmH, which includes Echerichia coli TrmH and Saccharomyces cerevisiae TrmH, modifies only a subset of tRNA species [[cite:PUB00079975]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1v2x", "name" "TrmH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029026", "name" "tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR029028", "name" "Alpha/beta knot methyltransferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd18092" "SAM-dependent tRNA methylase related to TrmH"}, "hamap" {"MF_02060" "tRNA (guanosine(18)-2'-O)-methyltransferase [trmH]"}, "panther" {"PTHR43453" "RRNA METHYLASE-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA (guanosine(18)-2'-O)-methyltransferase", "short" "TrmH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1667, "taxa" 8514, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8319, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8318, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6173}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
