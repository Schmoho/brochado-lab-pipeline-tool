{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of Raptor (regulatory associated protein of TOR) and its orthologs which includes Kog1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), a highly conserved 150kDa TOR-binding protein [[cite:PUB00015259], [cite:PUB00015260], [cite:PUB00015261]]. The target-of-rapamycin (TOR) proteins are protein kinases that were first identified in S. cerevisiae through mutants that conferred resistance to growth inhibition induced by the immunosuppressive macrolide rapamycin [[cite:PUB00000893]].</p>\n\n<p>All Raptor orthologs contain a unique conserved region in their N-terminal half (raptor N-terminal conserved, also called the RNC domain) followed by three HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and TOR1) repeats and seven WD-40 repeats near the C terminus. Research on mammalian Raptor suggests that its association with mTOR promotes the phosphorylation of downstream effectors in nutrient-stimulated cells [[cite:PUB00015259], [cite:PUB00015260]]. In concordance with these observations, the binding of TOR to Raptor or to Kog1p [[cite:PUB00015261]] is necessary for TOR signalling in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans and S. cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00015260], [cite:PUB00015261]].</p>\n\n<p>The RNC domain consists of 3 blocks with at least 67 to 79% sequence similarity and is predicted to have a high propensity to form Î± helices. The RNC domain is characterised by the presence of invariant catalytic Cys-His dyad, which is structurally and evolutionarily related to known caspases, suggesting that the raptor proteins may have protease activity [[cite:PUB00015263]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12848" "REGULATORY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN OF MTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Regulatory associated protein of TOR", "short" "Raptor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2533, "taxa" 8844, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6731, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6731, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1877}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2030", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2030"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004083", :literature {"PUB00015259" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kim DH" "Sarbassov DD" "Ali SM" "King JE" "Latek RR" "Erdjument-Bromage H" "Tempst P" "Sabatini DM."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00808-5", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "163-75", "volume" "110", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12150925}, "PUB00015260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hara K" "Maruki Y" "Long X" "Yoshino K" "Oshiro N" "Hidayat S" "Tokunaga C" "Avruch J" "Yonezawa K."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00833-4", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Raptor, a binding partner of target of rapamycin (TOR), mediates TOR action.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "177-89", "volume" "110", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12150926}, "PUB00015261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Loewith R" "Jacinto E" "Wullschleger S" "Lorberg A" "Crespo JL" "Bonenfant D" "Oppliger W" "Jenoe P" "Hall MN."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
