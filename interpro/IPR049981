{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from firmicutes, including SPy_0802 from Streptococcus pyogenes ([swissprot:Q9A0F1]), which has been called a virulence factor capable of binding host red blood cells to block immune response by white cells, and was named S protein [[cite:PUB00153520]].
