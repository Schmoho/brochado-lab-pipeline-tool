{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Sun family from fungi. In budding yeasts there are four identified members: Nca3, Sim1, Sun4 and Uth. They hey share a common C-terminal domain of 258 amino acids bearing 75-85% identity. These C-terminal regions comprise a putative Fe-binding domain consisting in Cys residues organised in a Cys-X5-Cys-X3-Cys-X24-Cys motif [[cite:PUB00077092]]. Despite this remarkable homology, the SUN family members have been linked to various, often unrelated cellular processes such as those connected to mitochondrial and cell wall functions. Interestingly, they seem to be involved in the remodelling of the yeast cell wall during the various phases of yeast culture development and under various environmental conditions [[cite:PUB00077093]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03856" "Beta-glucosidase (SUN family)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SUN family", "short" "SUN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 836, "taxa" 2228, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2379, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2368, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1556}, "pathways" 30}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
