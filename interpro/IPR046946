{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes TIR domain-containing adapter molecule 1 and 2 (TICAM1/2). TICAM1 is involved in innate immunity against invading pathogens. It is an adapter used by TLR3 and TLR4 (through TICAM2) to mediate NF-kappa-B and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) activation, and to induce apoptosis [[cite:PUB00068020], [cite:PUB00068021]].</p>\n\n<p>TICAM2 functions as sorting adapter in different signalling pathways to facilitate downstream signaling leading to type I interferon induction [[cite:PUB00101399], [cite:PUB00101402]]. It physically bridges TLR4 and TICAM1 and functionally transmits signal to TICAM1 in early endosomes after endocytosis of TLR4. In TLR2 signalling, physically bridges TLR2 and MYD88 and is required for the TLR2-dependent movement of MYD88 to endosomes following ligand engagement [[cite:PUB00101399], [cite:PUB00101400]]. TICAM2 forms a complex with RAB11FIP2 that is recruited to the phagosomes to promote the activation of the actin-regulatory GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 and subsequent phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00101401]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47230" "TIR DOMAIN-CONTAINING ADAPTER MOLECULE 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TIR domain-containing adapter molecule 1/2", "short" "TCAM1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 604, "taxa" 2128, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 997, "sets" 0, "proteins" 997, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 706}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046946", :literature {"PUB00101399" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Stack J" "Doyle SL" "Connolly DJ" "Reinert LS" "O'Keeffe KM" "McLoughlin RM" "Paludan SR" "Bowie AG."], "ISO_journal" "J Immunol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Immunol", "title" "TRAM is required for TLR2 endosomal signaling to type I IFN induction.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "6090-102", "volume" "193", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25385819}, "PUB00101402" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Huai W" "Song H" "Wang L" "Li B" "Zhao J" "Han L" "Gao C" "Jiang G" "Zhang L" "Zhao W."], "ISO_journal" "J Immunol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Immunol", "title" "Phosphatase PTPN4 preferentially inhibits TRIF-dependent TLR4 pathway by dephosphorylating TRAM.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "4458-65", "volume" "194", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25825441}, "PUB00101401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Skjesol A" "Yurchenko M" "Bosl K" "Gravastrand C" "Nilsen KE" "Grovdal LM" "Agliano F" "Patane F" "Lentini G" "Kim H" "Teti G" "Kumar Sharma A" "Kandasamy RK" "Sporsheim B" "Starheim KK" "Golenbock DT" "Stenmark H" "McCaffrey M" "Espevik T" "Husebye H."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "The TLR4 adaptor TRAM controls the phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria by interacting with the Rab11-family interacting protein 2.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "e1007684", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30883606}, "PUB00101400" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ohnishi H" "Tochio H" "Kato Z" "Kawamoto N" "Kimura T" "Kubota K" "Yamamoto T" "Funasaka T" "Nakano H" "Wong RW" "Shirakawa M" "Kondo N."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "TRAM is involved in IL-18 signaling and functions as a sorting adaptor for MyD88.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e38423", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22685567}, "PUB00068020" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Yamamoto M" "Sato S" "Mori K" "Hoshino K" "Takeuchi O" "Takeda K" "Akira S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
