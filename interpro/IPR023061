{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The UGA (TGA) codon is normally a termination codon, however it is also used as a selenocysteine (Sec) codon by numerous organisms [[cite:PUB00072493]]. Sec is the 21st amino acid that is inserted into selenoproteins (protein that includes a selenocysteine (Se-Cys) amino acid residue). The synthesis of Sec and its incorporation into proteins requires the activity of a number of proteins, one of which is selenophosphate synthetase (SPS), also known as the SelD gene product [[cite:PUB00014691], [cite:PUB00072494]]. SPS catalyses the production of the selenium donor compound monoselenophosphate (MSP) from selenide and ATP. MSP is then used to synthesize Sec from seryl-tRNAs [[cite:PUB00000070]].</p>\n\n<p>SPS was initially identified in E. coli as the product of the gene selD, one of four essential selenoprotein synthesis genes (selA-D) [[cite:PUB00072494], [cite:PUB00072501]]. SelC is the tRNA itself, SelD acts as a donor of reduced selenium, SelA modifies a serine residue on SelC into selenocysteine, and SelB is a selenocysteine-specific translation elongation factor. 3' or 5' non-coding elements of mRNA have been found as probable structures for directing selenocysteine incorporation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2zod", "name" "Crystal structure of selenophosphate synthetase from Aquifex aeolicus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036676", "name" "PurM-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00625" "Selenide, water dikinase [selD]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Selenophosphate synthetase, class I", "short" "SelD_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2892, "taxa" 12364, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13826, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13826, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8603}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
