{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PemK is a growth inhibitor in Escherichia coli known to bind to the promoter region of the Pem operon, auto-regulating synthesis. It is responsible for mediating cell death through inhibiting protein synthesis through the cleavage of single-stranded RNA. PemK is part of the PemK-PemI system, where PemI is an antitoxin that inhibits the action of the PemK toxin [[cite:PUB00016245]]. PemK homologues have been found in a wide range of bacteria, which together form an endonuclease family that interfere with mRNA function. This family consists of the PemK protein in addition to ChpA, ChpB, Kid and MazF.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1m1f", "name" "Kid toxin protein from E.coli plasmid R1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011067", "name" "Plasmid maintenance toxin/Cell growth inhibitor", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33988" "ENDORIBONUCLEASE MAZF-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF02452" "PemK-like, MazF-like toxin of type II toxin-antitoxin system"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF033490" "mRNA interferase MazF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "mRNA interferase PemK-like", "short" "PemK-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 58, "domain_architectures" 74, "proteomes" 5061, "taxa" 21657, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42321, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42300, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31506}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0321", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0321"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
