{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial GreA and GreB [interpro:IPR006358] promote transcription elongation by stimulating an endogenous, endonucleolytic transcript cleavage activity of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) [[cite:PUB00011909]], allowing RNA transcription to continue past template-encoded arresting sites. GreA and GreB are sequence homologues and have homologues in every known bacterial genome. GreA and GreB stimulate transcript cleavage in different ways; GreA induces cleavage of 3'-RNA fragments 2-3 nt in length and can only prevent the formation of arrested complexes, whereas GreB induces cleavage of fragments up to 18 nt in length and can rescue pre-existing arrested complexes.</p>\n\n<p>The 2.2 Angstrom resolution crystal structure of Escherichia coli GreA comprises an N-terminal antiparallel Î±-helical coiled coil, and a C-terminal globular domain. While the C-terminal domain binds RNAP, the N-terminal coiled coil interacts with the transcript 3' end and is responsible for stimulating the transcript cleavage reaction [[cite:PUB00004205]]. Functional differences between GreA and GreB correlate with the distribution of positively charged residues on one face of the N-terminal coiled coil.</p>\n\n<p>Because members of the family outside the Proteobacteria resemble GreA more closely than GreB, the GreB clade ([interpro:IPR006358]) forms a plausible outgroup and the remainder of the GreA/B family, included in this family, is designated GreA. In the Chlamydias and some spirochetes, the conserved region of these proteins is found as the C-terminal region of a much larger protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036953", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA/GreB, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01462" "transcription elongation factor GreA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA", "short" "Tscrpt_elong_fac_GreA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7772, "taxa" 31286, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35661, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35661, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27630}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006359", :literature {"PUB00011909" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Opalka N" "Chlenov M" "Chacon P" "Rice WJ" "Wriggers W" "Darst SA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00600-7", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure and function of the transcription elongation factor GreB bound to bacterial RNA polymerase.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "335-45", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12914698}, "PUB00004205" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6515", "authors" ["Stebbins CE" "Borukhov S" "Orlova M" "Polyakov A" "Goldfarb A" "Darst SA."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/373636a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Crystal structure of the GreA transcript cleavage factor from Escherichia coli.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "636-40", "volume" "373", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7854424}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0032784", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription elongation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023459", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA/GreB family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR028624", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA/GreB", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006358", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR006359", "name" "Transcription elongation factor GreA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR028625", "name" "Regulator of nucleoside diphosphate kinase", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
