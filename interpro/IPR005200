{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 81 ([cazy:GH81]) that are also known as Glucan endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidases. Proteins in this entry include fission yeast Eng1/Eng2 and budding yeast Dse4 (also known as Eng1). They have been shown to hydrolyse linear beta-1,3-glucan chains [[cite:PUB00077099]]. Eng1 is required for the degradation of the primary septum after completion of cytokinesis [[cite:PUB00077097], [cite:PUB00077098]]. Eng2 may couple the endocytic coat to the actin module [[cite:PUB00077100]].
