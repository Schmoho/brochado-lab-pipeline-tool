{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diverse DNA binding proteins are known to bind the CCAAT box, a common cis- acting element found in the promoter and enhancer regions of a large number of genes in eukaryotes. Amongst these proteins is one known as the CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) or nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) [[cite:PUB00004401]]. CBF is a heteromeric transcription factor that consists of two different components both needed for DNA-binding.</p>\n\n<p>The HAP protein complex of yeast binds to the upstream activation site of cytochrome C iso-1 gene (CYC1) as well as other genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport and activates their expression. It also recognises the sequence CCAAT and is structurally and evolutionary related to CBF.</p>\n\n<p>The first subunit of CBF is known as CBF-A or NF-YB in vertebrates, and HAP3 in budding yeast. The second subunit is known as CBF-B or NF-YA in vertebrates and HAP2 in budding yeast. It is a protein of 265 to 350 amino-acid residues which contains a highly conserved region of about 60 residues. This region, called the 'essential core' [[cite:PUB00003675]], seems to consist of two subdomains: an N-terminal subunit-association domain and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the NF-YA subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8qu4", "name" "NF-YB/C Heterodimer in Complex with a 13-mer NF-YA-derived Peptide Stabilized with C8-Hydrocarbon Linker in an alternative binding pose"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51152" "NF-YA/HAP2 family profile"}, "panther" {"PTHR12632" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NF-Y ALPHA-RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR00616" "CCAATSUBUNTB"}, "pfam" {"PF02045" "CCAAT-binding transcription factor (CBF-B/NF-YA) subunit B"}, "smart" {"SM00521" "CCAAT-Binding transcription Factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A", "short" "NFYA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 125, "proteomes" 2514, "taxa" 8748, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9978, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9959, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6248}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00578", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00578"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001289", :literature {"PUB00004401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Li XY" "Mantovani R" "Hooft van Huijsduijnen R" "Andre I" "Benoist C" "Mathis D."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/20.5.1087", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Evolutionary variation of the CCAAT-binding transcription factor NF-Y.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "1087-91", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1549471}, "PUB00003675" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Olesen JT" "Fikes JD" "Guarente L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
