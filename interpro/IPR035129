{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family has members such as US6 ([swissprot:Q6SW00]) found in HCMV (Human cytomegalovirus). US6 is a unique short region glycoprotein found in the ER. It blocks the binding of ATP by TAP1 (Transporter associated with Antigen Processing 1) through a conformational change and subsequently inhibits TAP-mediated peptide translocation to the ER. It also down regulates MHC class I [[cite:PUB00085209]]. Inhibition of US6 of TAP has been shown to require residues 89 to 108 of the HCMV US6 luminal domain, whereas sequences that flank this region stabilize the binding of the viral protein to TAP. Residues 81 to 90 and the C-terminal 39 residues of HCMV US6 may also contribute to the stabilization of the interaction between US6 and TAP [[cite:PUB00085210]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17616" "Viral unique short region 6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral unique short region 6", "short" "US6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035129", :literature {"PUB00085209" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Kim Y" "Park B" "Cho S" "Shin J" "Cho K" "Jun Y" "Ahn K."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000123", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Human cytomegalovirus UL18 utilizes US6 for evading the NK and T-cell responses.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "e1000123", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18688275}, "PUB00085210" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Dugan GE" "Hewitt EW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
