{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Apc5 is a subunit of the eukaryotic anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) which is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase that mediates the proteolysis of cell cycle proteins in mitosis and G1. Although Apc5 does not contain a classical RNA binding domain, it binds the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), which directly binds the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of growth factor 2 mRNA [[cite:PUB00059189]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes two Apc5 paralogues from C. elegans: such-1 and gfi-3. They are coexpressed in the germline but have nonoverlapping expression patterns in other tissues. They have a redundant function during the meiotic divisions [[cite:PUB00087469]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12830" "ANAPHASE-PROMOTING COMPLEX SUBUNIT 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5", "short" "Apc5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2401, "taxa" 8169, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4420, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4420, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2824}, "pathways" 67}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037679", :literature {"PUB00059189" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Koloteva-Levine N" "Pinchasi D" "Pereman I" "Zur A" "Brandeis M" "Elroy-Stein O."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
