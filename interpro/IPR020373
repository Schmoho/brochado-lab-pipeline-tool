{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase component 4 (Kgd4, also referred to as Ymr31/MRPS36) which was originally identified as a subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. Through biochemical studies, it was shown that this protein co purifies with the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), also called alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDH). Both mitochondrial ribosome 28S subunit and OGDC have a similar size and OGDC is highly abundant, being found to contaminate ribosomal preparations performed by sequential centrifugation steps [[cite:PUB00100356]]. Kgd4 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in the organization of mitochondrial α-KGDH complexes of fungi and animals which constitutes a molecular adaptor that is necessary to form a stable α-KGDH enzyme complex [[cite:PUB00100356], [cite:PUB00089008]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31601" "28S RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S36, MITOCHONDRIAL"}, "pfam" {"PF10937" "Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase component 4/YMR-31"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase component 4/YMR-31", "short" "Kgd4/YMR-31"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 1699, "taxa" 5750, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2786, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2751, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1774}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020373", :literature {"PUB00089008" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6230", "authors" ["Amunts A" "Brown A" "Toots J" "Scheres SHW" "Ramakrishnan V."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1193", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Ribosome.
