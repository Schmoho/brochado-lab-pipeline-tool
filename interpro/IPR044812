{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of plant Lysin motif (LysM) receptor kinases that recognise symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms in plants, characterised by the presence of one or more lysin motif (LysM) domains in the extracytoplasmic portion [[cite:PUB00097133]]. This entry includes LYK-1 (also known as Chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1, CERK1) and LYK-3 from Arabidopsis. They are cell surface receptors for chitin elicitor (chitooligosaccharides) signalling leading to innate immunity in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. They are involved in the resistance to pathogenic fungi by sensing microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) [[cite:PUB00097130], [cite:PUB00097132], [cite:PUB00097131]]. These proteins also recognise peptidoglycans and play an important role restricting bacterial growth [[cite:PUB00097133], [cite:PUB00097134], [cite:PUB00097135]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9gb9", "name" "Crystal structure of Lotus japonicus CERK6 kinase domain D460N"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46204" "CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LysM domain receptor kinase CERK1/LYK3-like", "short" "CERK1/LYK3-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 1035, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3120, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3120, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1863}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
