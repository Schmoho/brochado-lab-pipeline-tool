{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes serine hydroxymethyltransferases, transaldolases and other uncharacterised proteins.</p>\n\n<p>Serine hydroxymethyltransferase is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) requiring enzyme whose physiological role is to catalyse the formation of single carbon groups for a number of biosynthetic pathways.  It catalyses the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine with tetrahydrofolate serving as the one-carbon carrier. This reaction serves as the major source of one-carbon groups required for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidylate, methionine, and other important biomolecules. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase adopts an α/β structure consisting of a mixed β-sheet and α-helices packed on both sides of it [[cite:PUB00028352]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes L-threonine:uridine-5'-aldehyde transaldolase and fluorothreonine transaldolase. L-threonine:uridine-5'-aldehyde transaldolase is involved in the biosynthesis of the capuramycin-type nucleoside antibiotic A-102395 [[cite:PUB00153411]]. This enzyme catalyses the condensation of L-threonine and uridine-5'-aldehyde to form 5'-C-glycyluridine [[cite:PUB00153411], [cite:PUB00153412]]. Fluorothreonine transaldolase catalyses the final step in 4-fluorothreonine biosynthesis. Mediates a L-threonine/fluoroaceldehyde to 4-fluoro-L-threonine/acetaldehyde crossover reaction. It can also convert chloroacetaldehyde into 4-chloro-L-threonine [[cite:PUB00089683]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6smw", "name" "A. thaliana serine hydroxymethyltransferase isoform 2 (AtSHMT2) in complex with pemetrexed"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11680" "SERINE HYDROXYMETHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase-like", "short" "Ser_HO-MeTrfase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 171, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11988, "taxa" 47013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 69292, "sets" 0, "proteins" 69292, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51618}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
