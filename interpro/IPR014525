{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents hybrid ethylene sensor histidine kinases from plants, also known as ethylene receptors. It includes ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 from Arabidopsis thaliana, all of which contain a receiver domain at the C terminus. ETR1 has His kinase activity, whereas ETR2 and EIN4 have Ser/Thr kinase activity [[cite:PUB00089920]]. They are related to bacterial two-component regulators and act as a redundant negative regulator of ethylene signalling [[cite:PUB00076421]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF026389" "Hybrid ethylene sensor histidine kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ethylene receptor", "short" "ETR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 984, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1546, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1450, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 910}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
