{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents nucleoporins, of which the precursors of some undergo autolytic processing.  Some nucleoporins are synthesized as precursors, and each of these processes itself to release two large fragments that are both nucleoporins.  Cleavage is dependent upon a His/Ser catalytic dyad, and cleavage occurs at the N-terminal side of the catalytic Ser.  This means that the nucleoporin precursors are N-terminal nucleophile (NTN) hydrolases, but are structurally unrelated to other NTN hydrolases which are also peptidases, such as proteosome components.  Autoprocessing nucleoporin precursors are members of peptidase family S59.  The precursor Nup98-Nup96 (also known as nucleoporin 145 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nup189 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) processes itself to release Nup98 and Nup96 [[cite:PUB00011902], [cite:PUB00087455], [cite:PUB00087456]].  Nucleoporins Nup98 and Nup96 are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is the only means by which macromolecules enter and exit the nucleus.   Other nucleoporins in family S59 are not synthesized as precursors and do not undergo autoprocessing, such as Nup100 (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae).  Nup100 is also a component of the NPC and binds the karyopherin transport factor Kap95 at its repetitive tetrapeptide glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine (GLFG) motifs [[cite:PUB00087411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q5x", "name" "Crystal Structure of the C-terminal domain of hNup98"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23198" "NUCLEOPORIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoporin peptidase S59-like", "short" "Nucleoporin_S59-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2469, "taxa" 8601, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7844, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7844, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2719}, "pathways" 106}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
