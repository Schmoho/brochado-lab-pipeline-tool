Chitinases belong to glycoside hydrolase families 18 or 19 [[cite:PUB00000503]]. Chitinases of family 19 (also known as classes IA or I and IB or II) are enzymes from plants that function in the defence against fungal and insect pathogens by destroying their chitin-containing cell wall. Class IA/I and IB/II enzymes differ in the presence (IA/I) or absence (IB/II) of a N-terminal chitin-binding domain. The catalytic domain of these enzymes consist of about 220 to 230 amino acid residues.  The At2g43600 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana is presumably inactive as a chitinase because it lacks the Glu residue that is essential for catalytic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3wh1", "name" "Crystal Structure of a Family GH19 Chitinase from Bryum coronatum in complex with (GlcNAc)4 at 1.0 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023346", "name" "Lysozyme-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001060" "Endochitinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 19", "short" "Glyco_hydro_19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 34, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 735, "taxa" 2948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7473, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7103, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4847}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
