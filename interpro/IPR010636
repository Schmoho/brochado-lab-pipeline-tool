{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of fungal hydrophobins that seems to be restricted to ascomycetes. Hydrophobins are small, moderately hydrophobic extracellular proteins that have eight cysteine residues arranged in a strictly conserved motif. Hydrophobins are generally found on the outer surface of conidia and of the hyphal wall, and may be involved in mediating contact and communication between the fungus and its environment [[cite:PUB00012827]]. The family includes cryparin, which is a cell-surface-associated hydrophobin secreted by filamentous fungi [[cite:PUB00059146]]; cerato-ulmin, a secreted toxin hydrophobin involved in Dutch Elm disease [[cite:PUB00059147]]; and trihydrophobin from the ergot Claviceps fusiformis which self-assembles at hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces on hyphal surface [[cite:PUB00089655]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2b97", "name" "Ultra-high resolution structure of hydrophobin HFBII"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036686", "name" "Hydrophobin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd23508" "class II hydrophobins"}, "panther" {"PTHR42341" "HYDROPHOBIN"}, "pfam" {"PF06766" "Fungal hydrophobin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cerato-ulmin hydrophobin family", "short" "Cerato-ulmin_hydrophobin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 27, "proteomes" 458, "taxa" 1357, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1857, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1784, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1179}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010636", :literature {"PUB00059146" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["McCabe PM" "Van Alfen NK."], "ISO_journal" "Appl.
