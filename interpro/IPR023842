{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacillithiol (BSH) is a low-molecular-weight thiol, an analog of glutathione and mycothiol, that is found largely in the Firmicutes. BSH biosynthesis requires the presence of the deacetylases BshB1 or BshB2 (also termed YpjG and YojG, respectively) [[cite:PUB00055031]]. This entry represents BshB1, which catalyzes the second step of the pathway, the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosaminylmalate (GlcNAc-Mal) to glucosamine malate (GlcN-Mal) [[cite:PUB00055031]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1uan", "name" "Crystal structure of the conserved protein TT1542 from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024078", "name" "Putative deacetylase LmbE-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04001" "bacillithiol biosynthesis deacetylase BshB1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacillithiol biosynthesis deacetylase, BshB1", "short" "Bacillithiol_biosynth_BshB1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1386, "taxa" 4879, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5583, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5583, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4219}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0927", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0927"} {"accession" "GenProp1505", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1505"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
