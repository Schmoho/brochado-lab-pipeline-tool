{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes tricarboxylate transport proteins (TXTPs), which belong to the Solute carrier family 25 (SLC25), transport proteins at the inner mitochondrial membrane and functions as carriers for metabolites. Included in this entry is the human TXTP (SLC25A1) and its homologues; it is an electroneutral antiporter that exports citrate from the mitochondria into the cytosol in exchange for malate [[cite:PUB00152839], [cite:PUB00152840]]. It is also able to mediate the exchange of citrate for isocitrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, cis-aconitate and to a lesser extend cis-aconitate, maleate and succinate [[cite:PUB00152839]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes dicarboxylate transport proteins from plants and fungi, such as Succinate/fumarate mitochondrial transporter SFC1, which transports citrate, isocitrate and aconitate, succinate and fumarate. It catalyses a fast counter-exchange transport as well as a low uniport of substrates, having a higher transport affinity for tricarboxylates than dicarboxylates [[cite:PUB00152841], [cite:PUB00152843], [cite:PUB00152842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023395", "name" "Mitochondrial carrier domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45788" "SUCCINATE/FUMARATE MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSPORTER-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tricarboxylate transport protein-like", "short" "TXTP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2527, "taxa" 8629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8633, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5495}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049563", :literature {"PUB00152841" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Catoni E" "Schwab R" "Hilpert M" "Desimone M" "Schwacke R" "Flugge UI" "Schumacher K" "Frommer WB."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03782-1", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Identification of an Arabidopsis mitochondrial succinate-fumarate translocator.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "87-92", "volume" "534", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12527366}, "PUB00152842" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Brito DS" "Agrimi G" "Charton L" "Brilhaus D" "Bitetto MG" "Lana-Costa J" "Messina E" "Nascimento CP" "Feitosa-Araujo E" "Pires MV" "Perez-Diaz JL" "Obata T" "Porcelli V" "Palmieri L" "Araujo WL" "Weber APM" "Linka N" "Fernie AR" "Palmieri F" "Nunes-Nesi A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1042/BCJ20190785", "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "Biochemical and functional characterization of a mitochondrial citrate carrier in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1759-1777", "volume" "477", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32329787}, "PUB00152839" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Majd H" "King MS" "Smith AC" "Kunji ERS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta Bioenerg", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2017.10.002", "medline_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta Bioenerg", "title" "Pathogenic mutations of the human mitochondrial citrate carrier SLC25A1 lead to impaired citrate export required for lipid, dolichol, ubiquinone and sterol synthesis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1-7", "volume" "1859", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29031613}, "PUB00152840" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pop A" "Williams M" "Struys EA" "Monne M" "Jansen EEW" "De Grassi A" "Kanhai WA" "Scarcia P" "Ojeda MRF" "Porcelli V" "van Dooren SJM" "Lennertz P" "Nota B" "Abdenur JE" "Coman D" "Das AM" "El-Gharbawy A" "Nuoffer JM" "Polic B" "Santer R" "Weinhold N" "Zuccarelli B" "Palmieri F" "Palmieri L" "Salomons GS."], "ISO_journal" "J Inherit Metab Dis", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10545-017-0106-7", "medline_journal" "J Inherit Metab Dis", "title" "An overview of combined D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria: functional analysis of CIC variants.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "169-180", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29238895}, "PUB00152843" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Elshobaky A" "Lillo C" "Hoden KP" "Kataya ARA."], "ISO_journal" "Plants (Basel)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12132586", "medline_journal" "Plants (Basel)", "title" "Protein-Protein Interactions and Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveal Potential Mitochondrial Substrates of Protein Phosphatase 2A-B'Î¶ Holoenzyme.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2586", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37447147}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049563", "name" "Tricarboxylate transport protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
