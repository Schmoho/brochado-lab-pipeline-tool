{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>All fungal and animal N-terminally methylated proteins contain a unique N-terminal motif, Met-(Ala/Pro/Ser)-Pro-Lys. Alpha-N-methyltransferase methylates the N terminus of target proteins containing the N-terminal motif [Ala/Pro/Ser]-Pro-Lys when the initiator Met is cleaved. It catalyses mono-, di- or tri-methylation of the exposed alpha-amino group of Ala or Ser residue in the [Ala/Ser]-Pro-Lys motif and mono- or di-methylation of Pro in the Pro-Pro-Lys motif [[cite:PUB00073462], [cite:PUB00099595], [cite:PUB00099596]]. Some of the substrates may be primed by NTMT2-mediated monomethylation [[cite:PUB00099594]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7d8d", "name" "The crystal structure of ScNTM1 in complex with SAH and Rps25a hexapeptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05891" "AdoMet dependent proline di-methyltransferase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF016958" "Predicted S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferase, AD-003 type"}, "panther" {"PTHR12753" "AD-003 - RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alpha-N-methyltransferase NTM1", "short" "MeTrfase_NTM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 104, "proteomes" 2555, "taxa" 8805, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5405, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3656}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
