{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Escherichia coli stringent starvation protein B (SspB), is thought to enhance the specificity of degradation of tmRNA-tagged proteins by the ClpXP protease. The tmRNA tag, also known as ssrA, is an 11-aa peptide added to the C terminus of proteins stalled during translation, targets proteins for degradation by ClpXP and ClpAP. SspB is a cytoplasmic protein that specifically binds to residues 1-4 and 7 of the tag. Binding of SspB enhances degradation of tagged proteins by ClpX, and masks sequence elements important for ClpA interactions, inhibiting degradation by ClpA [[cite:PUB00010112]]. However, more recent work has cast doubt on the importance of SspB in wild-type cells [[cite:PUB00010113]]. SspB is encoded in an operon whose synthesis is stimulated by carbon, amino acid, and phosphate starvation. SspB may play a special role during nutrient stress, for example by ensuring rapid degradation of the products of stalled translation, without causing a global increase in degradation of all ClpXP substrates [[cite:PUB00009976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ou8", "name" "structure of an AAA+ protease delivery protein in complex with a peptide degradation tag"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036760", "name" "SspB-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04386" "Stringent starvation protein B"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005276" "ClpX-specific adaptor protein SspB"}, "panther" {"PTHR37486" "STRINGENT STARVATION PROTEIN B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stringent starvation protein B", "short" "SspB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 3259, "taxa" 12954, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13675, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13674, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10623}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0251", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0251"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007481", :literature {"PUB00009976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5488", "authors" ["Levchenko I" "Seidel M" "Sauer RT" "Baker TA."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.289.5488.2354", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "A specificity-enhancing factor for the ClpXP degradation machine.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2354-6", "volume" "289", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11009422}, "PUB00010112" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Flynn JM" "Levchenko I" "Seidel M" "Wickner SH" "Sauer RT" "Baker TA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
