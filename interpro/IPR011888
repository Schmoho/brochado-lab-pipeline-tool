{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many bacterial species are capable of anaerobic growth by using dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) as the terminal electron acceptor, with DMSO reductase as the terminal elctron transfer enzyme. In Escherichia coli and many other Gram-negative bacteria DMSO reductase is a membrane-bound enzyme composed of three subunits; a catalytic molybdenum-containing subunit (DmsA), an electron transfer subunit containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster (DmsB), and a hydrophobic membrane-spanning anchor subunit which attaches the enzyme to the cytoplasmic membrane (DmsC) [[cite:PUB00034652], [cite:PUB00028090]]. It is generally thought now that DmsAB faces the periplasm, contradicting previous results suggesting a cytoplasmic location. The N-terminal region of DmsA contains a \"twin-arginine\" signal sequence, suggesting export to the periplasm occurs via the TAT secretion pathway.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents known and predicted bacterial DmsA proteins. Several species contain one or more paralogs of DmsA. In <i>E. coli</i>, the two paralogs of DmsA, YnfE and YnfF, are encoded within the ynfEFGHI operon [[cite:PUB00034653]]. YnfE and YnfF cannot form a functional complex with DmsBC, but YnfFGH can restore growth on DMSO when DmABC is deleted. The function of YnfE is not known and it appears to prevent formation of the YnfFGH complex if present.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02166" "DMSO/selenate family reductase complex A subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anaerobic dimethyl sulphoxide reductase, subunit A, DmsA/YnfE", "short" "Anaer_DMSO_reductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 298, "taxa" 2056, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6718, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6716, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5560}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1148", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1148"} {"accession" "GenProp0637", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0637"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
