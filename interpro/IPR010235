{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The member of this family from Haemophilus influenzae, Probable ribonuclease HepT (also known as HI0074), is an homologue of the mRNA nuclease HepT (SO_3166) from Shewanella oneidensis, being probably the toxic component of a type VII toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. It contains a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain containing a RX4-6H motif whose conformations are remarkably different form SO_3166, indicating that they have different substrate-binding specificities [[cite:PUB00097219]]. It forms a complex with HI0073 ([swissprot:P43933]), encoded by the adjacent gene, which contains a nucleotidyltransferase nucleotide binding domain ([interpro:IPR002934]) [[cite:PUB00014788]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08780" "Nucleotidyltransferase substrate binding protein like"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01987" "HI0074 family nucleotidyltransferase substrate-binding subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Probable ribonuclease HepT", "short" "HepT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 811, "taxa" 5089, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5353, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5353, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4193}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010235", :literature {"PUB00014788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lehmann C" "Lim K" "Chalamasetty VR" "Krajewski W" "Melamud E" "Galkin A" "Howard A" "Kelman Z" "Reddy PT" "Murzin AG" "Herzberg O."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10260", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "The HI0073/HI0074 protein pair from Haemophilus influenzae is a member of a new nucleotidyltransferase family: structure, sequence analyses, and solution studies.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "249-60", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12486719}, "PUB00097219" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Jia X" "Yao J" "Gao Z" "Liu G" "Dong YH" "Wang X" "Zhang H."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Structure-function analyses reveal the molecular architecture and neutralization mechanism of a bacterial HEPN-MNT toxin-antitoxin system.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "6812-6823", "volume" "293", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29555683}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010235", "name" "Probable ribonuclease HepT", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 1122}}}
