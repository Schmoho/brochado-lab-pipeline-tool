{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNPH1 (also known as Rcl) is an enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism. It catalyses the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates to yield deoxyribose 5-phosphate and a purine or pyrimidine base [[cite:PUB00068837]]. Deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates containing purine bases are preferred to those containing pyrimidine bases. This enzyme is over-expressed in several cancers [[cite:PUB00068901]], which may be a potential molecular target for cancer treatment [[cite:PUB00100517]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8osc", "name" "Structure of Homo sapiens 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate N-hydrolase 1 (DNPH1) bound to deoxyuridine 5'- monophosphate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03036" "2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate N-hydrolase 1 [DNPH1]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-deoxynucleoside 5-phosphate N-hydrolase 1, DNPH1", "short" "DNPH1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 346, "taxa" 2158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1106, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 767}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
