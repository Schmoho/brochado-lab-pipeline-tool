{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of archaeal proteins that contain a cro/C1-type HTH domain. \n The cro/C1-type HTH domain is a DNA-binding, helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of about 50-60 residues present in transcriptional regulators. The domain is named after the transcriptional repressors Cro and C1 of temperate bacteriophages 434 and lambda, respectively. Besides the bacteriophages, cro/C1-type regulators are present in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00584" "Putative HTH-type transcriptional regulatory protein <locus_tag>"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative HTH-type transcriptional regulator, archaea", "short" "Arc_TR_HTH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 259, "taxa" 1694, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1723, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1723, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1454}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020886", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020886", "name" "Putative HTH-type transcriptional regulator, archaea", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
