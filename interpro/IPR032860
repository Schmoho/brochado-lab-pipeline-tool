{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Based on homology with E. coli AlkB, nine mammalian AlkB homologues have been identified. Like E. coli AlkB, ALKBH2 and ALKBH3 have been shown to possess DNA repair activity.

Reversible m(6)A modification is one of the most abundant RNA modifications, and is probably involved in broad and fundamental functions in mammalian cells [[cite:PUB00076933]].
