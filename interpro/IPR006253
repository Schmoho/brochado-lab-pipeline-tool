{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Malate synthase G (MSG, 723 residues) is an enzyme of the glyoxylate pathway, that catalyses the Claisen condensation and subsequent hydrolysis of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and glyoxylate to form malate and CoA [[cite:PUB00029759], [cite:PUB00048047]]. This biochemical bypass is used by microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, and fungi) for biosynthesis under anaerobic conditions [[cite:PUB00033596]]. Enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass have been implicated as virulence factors in several pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis [[cite:PUB00033597], [cite:PUB00033598], [cite:PUB00033599]].</p>\n\n<p>The X-ray structure of the ternary abortive complex of MSG with pyruvate (glyoxylate mimic) and acetyl-CoA has been determined [[cite:PUB00029759]] and shown to have the same structure as in the complex with glyoxylate [[cite:PUB00014321]]. MSG is composed of four domains: an N-terminal α-helical clasp, a central TIM barrel α/β core, an α/β domain which may have a regulatory function, and a C-terminal five α-helical bundle [[cite:PUB00048047]]. The cleft between the TIM β/α-barrel fold and the C-terminal helical domain forms the active site of malate synthases [[cite:PUB00051135], [cite:PUB00029759], [cite:PUB00014321]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vfb", "name" "1.36 Angstrom Resolution Crystal Structure of Malate Synthase G from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Complex with Glycolic Acid."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011076", "name" "Malate synthase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00728" "malate_synt_G"}, "panther" {"PTHR42739" "MALATE SYNTHASE G"}, "hamap" {"MF_00641" "Malate synthase G [glcB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01345" "malate synthase G"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Malate synthase G", "short" "Malate_synthG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 60, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2605, "taxa" 9719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11813, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11813, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9133}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1556", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1556"} {"accession" "GenProp0023", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0023"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
