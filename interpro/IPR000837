{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The transcription factor activator protein (AP)-1 consists of Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2), ATF and JDP family members [[cite:PUB00071074]]. They are basic leucine zipper transcription factors that play a central role in regulating gene transcription in various biological processes [[cite:PUB00071041]]. This entry includes Fos, ATF-3 and JDP family members.</p>\n\n<p>AP-1 proteins have an Î±-helical bZIP domain, which contains a basic DNA-binding region and regularly spaced leucine residues known as the leucine zipper motif [[cite:PUB00071073]]. They have similar protein structure and can either form homodimers or form heterodimers with other AP-1 proteins (predominantly with Jun proteins), which can then bind to TRE-like sequences (consensus sequence 5'-TGAG/CTCA-3') [[cite:PUB00071074]]. Each of these proteins are expressed in different tissues and can be regulated in different ways, which means that every cell type has a complex mixture of AP-1 dimers with subtly different functions [[cite:PUB00071074]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7ucc", "name" "Transcription factor FosB/JunD bZIP domain in the reduced form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00042" "LEUZIPPRFOS"}, "panther" {"PTHR23351" "FOS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AP-1 transcription factor", "short" "AP-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1349, "taxa" 5254, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11719, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10801, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6966}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000837", :literature {"PUB00071074" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 25", "authors" ["Hess J" "Angel P" "Schorpp-Kistner M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
