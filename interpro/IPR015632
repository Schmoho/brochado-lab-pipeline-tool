{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The CD2 adhesion molecule is a cell surface protein expressed by T cells and natural killer cells. CD2's extracellular domain contains immunoglobulin-like domains that are glycosylated at two sites and can mediate homodimerisation [[cite:PUB00034961]]. Ligation of CD2 by CD58 in humans or CD48 in mice helps T cells adhere to antigen-presenting cells, and initiates signal transduction pathways that enhance signalling through the T cell receptor for antigen. CD2 knockout mice exhibit essentially normal immune function [[cite:PUB00034962]], and it is thought that CD2 is somewhat functionally redundant with other T cell co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28 [[cite:PUB00034963]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1a64", "name" "ENGINEERING A MISFOLDED FORM OF RAT CD2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01870" "T-cell surface CD2 antigen"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T-cell surface antigen CD2", "short" "CD2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 200, "taxa" 787, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1515, "sets" 0, "proteins" 348, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 230}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015632", :literature {"PUB00034961" {"URL" nil, "issue" "50", "authors" ["Chen HA" "Pfuhl M" "Driscoll PC."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi026447x", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "The pH dependence of CD2 domain 1 self-association and 15N chemical exchange broadening is correlated with the anomalous pKa of Glu41.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "14680-8", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12475217}, "PUB00034962" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Killeen N" "Stuart SG" "Littman DR."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=1358605", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Development and function of T cells in mice with a disrupted CD2 gene.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "4329-36", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1358605}, "PUB00034963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hutchcroft JE" "Slavik JM" "Lin H" "Watanabe T" "Bierer BE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
