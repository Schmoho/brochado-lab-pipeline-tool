{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amphiphysins belong to the expanding BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) family proteins, all members of which share a highly conserved N-terminal BAR domain, which has predicted coiled-coil structures required for amphiphysin dimerisation and plasma membrane interaction [[cite:PUB00014927], [cite:PUB00065067]]. Almost all members also share a conserved C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which mediates their interactions with the GTPase dynamin and the inositol-5'-phosphatase synaptojanin 1 in vertebrates and with actin in yeast. The central region of all these proteins is most variable. In mammals, the central region of amphiphysin I and amphiphysin IIa contains a proline-arginine-rich region for endophilin binding and a CLAP domain, for binding to clathrin and AP-2. The interactions mediated by both the central and C-terminal domains are believed to be modulated by protein phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00006137], [cite:PUB00006087]].</p>\n\n<p>Amphiphysins are key players in the control of plasma membrane curvature, membrane shaping and membrane remodeling, involved involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the endosomal sorting of membrane proteins, actin function, and signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00101549], [cite:PUB00101548]]. In vertebrates, amphiphysins may regulate, but are not essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of SVs. However, in Drosophila amphiphysin is not involved at all in SV endocytosis but is required for T-tubule structure and excitation-contraction coupling muscles and plays a role in membrane morphogenesis in developing photoreceptors and a variety of other cells [[cite:PUB00014927]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4atm", "name" "Crystal structure of the BAR domain of human Amphiphysin, isoform 1 at 1.8 Angstrom resolution featuring increased order at the N- terminus."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46514" "AMPHIPHYSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Amphiphysin", "short" "Amphiphysin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 970, "taxa" 3881, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 6956, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6956, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4184}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003005", :literature {"PUB00014927" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Zhang B" "Zelhof AC."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0854.2002.30702.x", "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "Amphiphysins: raising the BAR for synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane dynamics.
