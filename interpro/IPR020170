{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>UL11 (also known as cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3) is conserved throughout the herpesvirus family. It is a membrane-associated tegument protein that is incorporated into the HSV virion. UL11 and UL51, either singly or in combination, are involved in virion envelopment and/or egress. Both proteins are fatty acylated. UL11 is acylated by both myristoic and palmitoic acids while UL51 is mono-acylated by palmitoic acid [[cite:PUB00045941]]. UL11 homologue (U71) from HHV-6A/B is a myristylated virion protein which is expressed at the early stage of the lytic cycle [[cite:PUB00085328]]. Proteins in this entry are from the muromegalovirus and roseolovirus groups.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17474" "Tegument protein UL11 homolog"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL11, muromegalovirus/roseolovirus-type", "short" "Herpes_UL11_megaloV/roseoloV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 83, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39, "sets" 0, "proteins" 39, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020170", :literature {"PUB00045941" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Koshizuka T" "Kawaguchi Y" "Nozawa N" "Mori I" "Nishiyama Y."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Genes", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-007-0156-2", "medline_journal" "Virus Genes", "title" "Herpes simplex virus protein UL11 but not UL51 is associated with lipid rafts.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "571-5", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17694428}, "PUB00085328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gerdemann U" "Keukens L" "Keirnan JM" "Katari UL" "Nguyen CT" "de Pagter AP" "Ramos CA" "Kennedy-Nasser A" "Gottschalk SM" "Heslop HE" "Brenner MK" "Rooney CM" "Leen AM."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2012-05-430413", "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "Immunotherapeutic strategies to prevent and treat human herpesvirus 6 reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "207-18", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23152545}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034705", "name" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 3", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR020170", "name" "Herpesvirus UL11, muromegalovirus/roseolovirus-type", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 11}}}
