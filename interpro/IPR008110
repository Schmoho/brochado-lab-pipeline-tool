{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Periodontal disease in humans is a major health problem in the developed world, and is caused by a number of specialised pathogens that inhabit the oral cavity. Amongst the bacterial species culturable from periodontal lesions are the streptococcal microbes Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, and the Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis) [[cite:PUB00010271]]. The latter bacterium has been implicated as the causative agent of peridontitis, pulpal infections and tonsillar abcesses [[cite:PUB00010271]].</p>\n\n<p>Adherence by P. gingivalis to the periodontal surface is mediated by its major virulence factor fimbriae [[cite:PUB00010262]]. This differs from other pathogenic Gram-negative bacterial polymeric Type I and IV fimbriae/pili in that it is much more simplified, consisting of only a monomeric fimbrillin repeating subunit, Fma1/FimA. Fma1/FimA has a molecular weight of 43kDa, and can exhibit antigenic diversity in different P. gingivalis strains [[cite:PUB00010262]]. Unusually, this form of fimbrillin possesses a far longer leader peptide compared to the fimbrial subunits of other bacteria [[cite:PUB00010262]]. It has been hypothesised that this allows for the maturation of the preprotein during secretion [[cite:PUB00010262]].</p>\n\n<p>Recently, a study into the different antigenic types of P. gingivalis fimbrillin classified them into five distinct groups, depending on their gene sequences [[cite:PUB00010404]]. Investigations into the functional differences of each type revealed that in the majority of peridontitis cases, bacterial strains possessing the type II Fma1/FimA were the most prevalent [[cite:PUB00010404]]; in healthy adults, type I strains were the most common. This has implications for particular strains that are associated with periodontal disease.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01737" "FIMBRILLIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin protein", "short" "Fimbrillin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 38, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 594, "sets" 0, "proteins" 104, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008110", :literature {"PUB00010262" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lee JY" "Sojar HT" "Bedi GS" "Genco RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
