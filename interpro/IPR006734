{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents plant AT-rich sequence and zinc-binding proteins (PLATZ), which are zinc dependent DNA binding proteins. They bind to AT rich sequences and functions in transcriptional repression [[cite:PUB00045078]]. Included in this family is the protein RGF1 INDUCIBLE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (RITF1), a transcription factor that plays a central role in mediating RGF1 hormone peptide signalling, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in roots to modulate meristem size and root growth, probably via oxidative post-translational modification of the transcription factor PLETHORA [[cite:PUB00096638]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04640" "PLATZ transcription factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PLATZ transcription factor", "short" "PLATZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 64, "proteomes" 288, "taxa" 1131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6259, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6217, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3694}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006734", :literature {"PUB00045078" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Nagano Y" "Furuhashi H" "Inaba T" "Sasaki Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/29.20.4097", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "A novel class of plant-specific zinc-dependent DNA-binding protein that binds to A/T-rich DNA sequences.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "4097-105", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11600698}, "PUB00096638" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7788", "authors" ["Yamada M" "Han X" "Benfey PN."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "RGF1 controls root meristem size through ROS signalling.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "85-88", "volume" "577", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31801996}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006734", "name" "PLATZ transcription factor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 52, "alignment:full" 3636}}}
