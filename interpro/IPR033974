{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glycerol dehydratase activase (GD-AE) contains the canonical [Fe4S4] binding motif and two additional ferredoxin-like [4Fe-4S] cluster binding domains. It is an organic radical activase that forms a glycyl radical on the B12-independent glycerol dehydratase and, counter to the paradigm of the common activation step of the Radical SAM superfamily, produces 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) and 2-aminobutyrate rather than 5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-dA) and methionine. The formation of MTA rather than 5'-dA is somewhat analogous to the Radical SAM 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical forming Superfamily and thus a similar radical intermediate has been proposed. This alternative reductive cleavage pathway for SAM is surprising given the structural similarities between the GD and PFL at the level of both primary and tertiary structure, it is difficult at this time to determine exactly why the GD-AE follows a different reductive cleavage pathway during glycyl radical formation. The precise identity of the radical intermediate in the GD-AE activation mechanism is still under investigation [[cite:PUB00081926], [cite:PUB00016707], [cite:PUB00030576]].</p>\r\n<reaction>glycerol dehydratase (inactive) + S-adenosyl-L-methioninate + 1,5-dihydroflavin ->glycerol dehydratase (active) + L-methionine zwitterion + 5'-deoxyadenosine+semiquinone</reaction>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00298" "glycerol dehydratase activase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol dehydratase activase", "short" "Glycerol_dehydratase_activase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 36, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033974", :literature {"PUB00081926" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Demick JM" "Lanzilotta WN."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi101255e", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Radical SAM activation of the B12-independent glycerol dehydratase results in formation of 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine and not 5'-deoxyadenosine.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "440-2", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21182298}, "PUB00016707" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Raynaud C" "Sarcabal P" "Meynial-Salles I" "Croux C" "Soucaille P."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
