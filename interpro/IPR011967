{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (also known as PaaH) and related bacterial proteins. PaaH is involved in the degradation of phenylacetic acid, presumably in steps following the opening of the phenyl ring [[cite:PUB00010200]].  The sequences included in this entry are all found in possible operons with other related genes such as paaA, paaB, paaD, paaE, paaF and paaN [[cite:PUB00015494]].  Some genomes contain these other genes without an apparent paaC in the same operon -possibly in these cases a different dehydrogenase involved in fatty acid degradation may fill in the needed activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02279" "3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase PaaH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA dehydrogenase PaaH", "short" "3-OHacyl-CoA_DH_PaaH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 147, "taxa" 922, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 691}, "pathways" 147}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
