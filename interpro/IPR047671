{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the DNA-binding response regulator MtrA, which is a member of MtrA/MtrB, a highly conserved two-component system (TCS) implicated in the regulation of cell division in the actinobacteria, playing a role in secondary metabolism and morphological development [[cite:PUB00105906], [cite:PUB00105907], [cite:PUB00105910]]. In unicellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis, MtrAB coordinates DNA replication with cell division and regulates the transcription of resuscitation-promoting factor B where MtrA is essential [[cite:PUB00105909]]. In filamentous Streptomyces venezuelae, it links antibiotic production to sporulation [[cite:PUB00105908]].</p>\n\n<p>MtrA binds to a consensus recognition sequence, composed of a 17-nt sequence containing two direct repeats of six nt, and needs to be phosphorylated to act in regulon expression. In Streptomyces, MtrA has been additionally described as a novel nitrogen metabolism regulator [[cite:PUB00105910]]. MtrA belongs to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators that contain N-terminal receiver (REC) domain and C-terminal DNA-binding winged helix-turn-helix effector domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011006", "name" "CheY-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040689" "MtrAB system response regulator MtrA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MtrAB system response regulator MtrA", "short" "MtrAB_MtrA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1824, "taxa" 5102, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4813, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4813, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3797}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047671", :literature {"PUB00105907" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sharma AK" "Chatterjee A" "Gupta S" "Banerjee R" "Mandal S" "Mukhopadhyay J" "Basu J" "Kundu M."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "MtrA, an essential response regulator of the MtrAB two-component system, regulates the transcription of resuscitation-promoting factor B of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1271-81", "volume" "161", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25833257}, "PUB00105906" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["Plocinska R" "Purushotham G" "Sarva K" "Vadrevu IS" "Pandeeti EV" "Arora N" "Plocinski P" "Madiraju MV" "Rajagopalan M."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Septal localization of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis MtrB sensor kinase promotes MtrA regulon expression.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "23887-99", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22610443}, "PUB00105910" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhu Y" "Zhang P" "Zhang J" "Xu W" "Wang X" "Wu L" "Sheng D" "Ma W" "Cao G" "Chen XL" "Lu Y" "Zhang YZ" "Pang X."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "The developmental regulator MtrA binds GlnR boxes and represses nitrogen metabolism genes in Streptomyces coelicolor.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "29-46", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30927282}, "PUB00105909" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chatterjee A" "Sharma AK" "Mahatha AC" "Banerjee SK" "Kumar M" "Saha S" "Basu J" "Kundu M."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Global mapping of MtrA-binding sites links MtrA to regulation of its targets in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "99-110", "volume" "164", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29182512}, "PUB00105908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Som NF" "Heine D" "Holmes N" "Knowles F" "Chandra G" "Seipke RF" "Hoskisson PA" "Wilkinson B" "Hutchings MI."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "The MtrAB two-component system controls antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1415-1419", "volume" "163", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28884676}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000156", "name" "phosphorelay response regulator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000976", "name" "transcription cis-regulatory region binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045893", "name" "positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039420", "name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein WalR-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR006291", "name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein CusR-like, heavy metal response", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011879", "name" "Signal transduction response regulator, phosphate regulon transcriptional regulatory protein PhoB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022305", "name" "Sortase system response regulator", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047671", "name" "MtrAB system response regulator MtrA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR047791", "name" "Response regulator WalR", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR049766", "name" "Transcriptional regulatory protein CseB", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR049767", "name" "Two-component system response regulator RppA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
