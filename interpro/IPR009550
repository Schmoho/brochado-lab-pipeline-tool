{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a conserved region within Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirE3. Agrobacterium tumefaciens (a plant pathogen) has a tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid of which part, the transfer (T)-region, is transferred to plant cells during the infection process. Vir proteins mediate the processing of the T-region and the transfer of a single-stranded (ss) DNA copy of this region, the T-strand, into the recipient cells. VirE3 is a translocated effector protein, but its specific role has not been established [[cite:PUB00012780]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06661" "VirE3"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036105" "Virulence protein VirE3, Rhizobiaceae type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "VirE3", "short" "VirE3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 90}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009550", :literature {"PUB00012780" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Schrammeijer B" "den Dulk-Ras A" "Vergunst AC" "Jurado Jacome E" "Hooykaas PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkg179", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Analysis of Vir protein translocation from Agrobacterium tumefaciens using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model: evidence for transport of a novel effector protein VirE3.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "860-8", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12560481}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009550", "name" "VirE3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 14}}}
