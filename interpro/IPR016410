{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains proteins related to the phage/prophage-immunity proteins and includes the immunity (imm) gene of the Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4. The Imm protein affects the exclusion of phage superinfecting cells already infected with T4. Phage which were excluded upon infection of cells possessing a plasmid-encoded Imm protein ejected only about one-half of their DNA. Therefore, the Imm protein inhibited, directly or indirectly, DNA ejection [[cite:PUB00045926]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14373" "Superinfection immunity protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004305" "Phage-associated immunity protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage-associated immunity protein", "short" "Phage_imm"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 582, "taxa" 3410, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2798, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1455}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016410", :literature {"PUB00045926" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Lu MJ" "Henning U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
