{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a zinc-finger transcription factor exclusively expressed in the foetal pancreas and nervous system, and in tumours of neuroendocrine origin. It can recruits cyclin D1 and HDACs, which confer transcriptional repressor activity [[cite:PUB00093527]]. It is involved in endocrine and neuronal cell differentiation [[cite:PUB00093528]]. In pancreas, it is activated by the islet-specific endocrine factor neurogenin 3, and subsequently regulates downstream target genes NeuroD1 and insulin during beta-cell maturation [[cite:PUB00093529]].</p>\n\n<p>Transcription factor egl-46 is the C. elegans orthologue from human  INSM2, which is involved in neuron differentiation [[cite:PUB00100196]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15065" "INSULINOMA-ASSOCIATED 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Insulinoma-associated protein 1/2", "short" "INSM1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 737, "taxa" 3116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1701, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1701, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1066}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042972", :literature {"PUB00100196" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Zheng C" "Jin FQ" "Trippe BL" "Wu J" "Chalfie M."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Inhibition of cell fate repressors secures the differentiation of the touch receptor neurons of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "145", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30291162}, "PUB00093527" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Liu WD" "Wang HW" "Muguira M" "Breslin MB" "Lan MS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
