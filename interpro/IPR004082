{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a plant specific protein family, OBERON (OBE), also known as ptyvirus VPg-interacting protein (PVIP). In Arabidopsis, there are four OBEs, OBE1-4. OBE1 together with OBE2 are required for the maintenance and/or establishment of both the shoot and root meristems, probably by controlling the expression of the meristem genes such as WUS, PLT1 and PLT2 and of genes required for auxin responses [[cite:PUB00067922]]. All four OBE proteins are able to interact with OBE1 and 2. However, OBE3 and 4 do not self-interact or interact with each other [[cite:PUB00067923]]. OBE1 and OBE2 also bind to virus genome-linked proteins (VPgs) of a diverse range of potyviruses and functions as an ancillary factor to support potyvirus movement in plants [[cite:PUB00067924]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21736" "VERNALIZATION-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN 3"}, "prints" {"PR01544" "ARATH130DUF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein OBERON", "short" "OBERON"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 979, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2102, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1161}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004082", :literature {"PUB00067923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Thomas CL" "Schmidt D" "Bayer EM" "Dreos R" "Maule AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03874.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Arabidopsis plant homeodomain finger proteins operate downstream of auxin accumulation in specifying the vasculature and primary root meristem.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "426-36", "volume" "59", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19392692}, "PUB00067924" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Dunoyer P" "Thomas C" "Harrison S" "Revers F" "Maule A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
