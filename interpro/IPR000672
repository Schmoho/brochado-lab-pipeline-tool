{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Enzymes that participate in the transfer of one-carbon units require the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate (THF). Various reactions generate one-carbon derivatives of THF, which can be interconverted between different oxidation states by methylene-THF dehydrogenase ([ec:1.5.1.5]), methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase ([ec:3.5.4.9]) and formyl-THF synthetase ([ec:6.3.4.3]) [[cite:PUB00000304], [cite:PUB00000651]]. The dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities are expressed by a variety of multifunctional enzymes, including the tri-functional eukaryotic C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase [[cite:PUB00000304]]; a bifunctional eukaryotic mitochondrial protein; and the bifunctional Escherichia coli folD protein [[cite:PUB00000304], [cite:PUB00000651]]. Methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-hydrolase share an overlapping active site [[cite:PUB00000304]], and as such are usually located together in proteins, acting in tandem on the carbon-nitrogen bonds of substrates other than peptide bonds.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2c2x", "name" "Three dimensional structure of bifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01576" "Bifunctional protein FolD [folD]"}, "prints" {"PR00085" "THFDHDRGNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase", "short" "THF_DH/CycHdrlase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 44, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11876, "taxa" 45890, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 78427, "sets" 0, "proteins" 61772, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 45825}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00616", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00616"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
