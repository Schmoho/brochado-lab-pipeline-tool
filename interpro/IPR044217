{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of plant proteins, including CLPT1/2 from Arabidopsis. CLPT1/2  are accessory proteins regulating the assembly of the plastidial Clp protease system [[cite:PUB00095513], [cite:PUB00094775]]. During assembly of the Clp proteolytic core, ClpT1 first binds to the P-ring (consisting of ClpP3-6 subunits) followed by ClpT2, and only then does the P-ring combine with the R-ring (ClpP1, ClpR1-4 subunits) [[cite:PUB00095513]]. CLPT1/2 share structural similarities to the N-domains of bacterial ClpA/C chaperones [[cite:PUB00094775]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3fes", "name" "Crystal Structure of the ATP-dependent Clp Protease ClpC from Clostridium difficile"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036628", "name" "Clp, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47016" "ATP-DEPENDENT CLP PROTEASE ATP-BINDING SUBUNIT CLPT1, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit CLPT1/2", "short" "CLPT1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 962, "taxa" 4118, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4568, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3140}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044217", :literature {"PUB00095513" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sjogren LL" "Clarke AK."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Assembly of the chloroplast ATP-dependent Clp protease in Arabidopsis is regulated by the ClpT accessory proteins.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "322-32", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21266658}, "PUB00094775" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kim J" "Kimber MS" "Nishimura K" "Friso G" "Schultz L" "Ponnala L" "van Wijk KJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Structures, Functions, and Interactions of ClpT1 and ClpT2 in the Clp Protease System of Arabidopsis Chloroplasts.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "1477-96", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25921872}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044217", "name" "ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit CLPT1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
