{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents an uncharacterized protein of approximately 54 amino acids found in T5-like bacteriophages that infect Escherichia coli and Salmonella.  Homologs have been identified in several T5-like phages including bacteriophage T5, Salmonella phage vB_SenS_SB13, and Escherichia phage vB_EcoS-26175V. Structure prediction suggests that this protein forms a strand swapped homodimeric arrangement. The dimeric structure forms two four stranded sheets that are connected by two alpha helices. The C-terminal of each protein is donated to the sheet made by the other monomer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23965" "Family of unknown function (DUF7293)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7293", "short" "DUF7293"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 254, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 193, "sets" 0, "proteins" 193, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055717", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055717", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7293", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 16}}}
