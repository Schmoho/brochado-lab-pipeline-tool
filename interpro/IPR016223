AGT catalyses the transfer of glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine of T4 DNA to yield glucosyl 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine [[cite:PUB00099917]]. This protein adopts the GT-B fold and binds both the sugar donor and acceptor to the C-terminal domain. There is evidence for a role of AGT in the base-flipping mechanism and for its specific recognition of the acceptor base [[cite:PUB00038369]].
