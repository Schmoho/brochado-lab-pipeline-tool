{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The bacteriophage P2 capsid is formed by multiple copies of the capsid protein GpN. The scaffolding protein GpO, which is essential for the assembly of this capsid, consists of an N-terminal serine protease domain and a C-terminal scaffolding domain [[cite:PUB00011914], [cite:PUB00056601]]. During capsid assembly, GpO interacts with GpN via the N-terminal domain, while the C-terminal domain plays an essential role as a scaffold. When capsid assembly is complete the C-terminal domain of GpO is cleaved autocatalytically. Cleavage of GpN to its mature form by the remaining N-terminal domain then completes the maturation process.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05929" "Phage capsid scaffolding protein (GPO) serine peptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Capsid scaffolding protein GpO", "short" "Capsid_scaffold_GpO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 336, "taxa" 2697, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3992, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3992, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3047}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
