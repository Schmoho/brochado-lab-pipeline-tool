{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sequences in this family of proteins belong to the polysaccharide export protein family, which includes the Wza [[cite:PUB00008202]] from Escherichia coli. This family of proteins are homologous to the EpsE protein of the methanolan biosynthesis operon of Methylobacillus sp. 12S [[cite:PUB00021014]]. The distribution of this protein appears to be restricted to a subset of exopolysaccharide operons containing a syntenic grouping of genes including a variant of the EpsH exosortase protein [[cite:PUB00021014]]. Exosortase has been proposed to be involved in the targeting and processing of proteins containing the PEP-CTERM domain to the exopolysaccharide layer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03028" "polysaccharide export protein EpsE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polysaccharide export EpsE", "short" "Polysacc_export_EpsE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 197, "taxa" 672, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 615, "sets" 0, "proteins" 615, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 482}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0655", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0655"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017478", :literature {"PUB00008202" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Stevenson G" "Andrianopoulos K" "Hobbs M" "Reeves PR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
