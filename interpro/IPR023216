{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the SKI/SnoN family of proteins, which are the products of the oncogenic sno gene. This gene was identified based on its homology to<i>v-ski</i>, the transforming component of the Sloan-Kettering virus. Both Ski and SnoN are potent negative regulators of TGF-beta [[cite:PUB00097260]]. Overexpression of Ski or SnoN results in oncogenic transformation of avian fibroblasts; however it may also result in terminal differentiation and therefore the Ski/SnoN mechanism of action is thought to be complex [[cite:PUB00054070]].</p>\n\n<p>These proteins do not have catalytic or DNA-binding activity and therefore function primarily through interaction with other proteins, acting as transcriptional cofactors. Despite their lack of DNA-binding ability, their primary function is related to transcriptional regulation, in particular the negative regulation of TGF-beta signalling [[cite:PUB00097260], [cite:PUB00054071]]. Ski/SnoN interact concurrently with co-Smad and R-Smad and in doing so block the ability of the Smad complexes to activate transcription of the TGF-beta target genes [[cite:PUB00013959]]. Binding of Ski/SnoN may additionally stabilise the Smad heteromer on DNA, therefore preventing further binding of active Smad complexes [[cite:PUB00035365]]. As Smad complexes critically mediate the inhibitory signals of TGF-beta in epithelial cells, high levels of SKI/SnoN may promote cell proliferation. They repress gene transcription recruiting diverse corepressors and histone deacetylases and stablish cross-regulatory mechanisms with TGF-beta/Smad pathway that control the magnitude and duration of TGF-beta signals. The alteration in regulatory processes may lead to disease development [[cite:PUB00097260]].</p>\n\n<p>High levels of SnoN have been shown to stabilise p53 with a resultant increase in premature senescence. SnoN interacts with the PML protein and is then recruited to the PML nuclear bodies, resulting in stabilisation of p53 and premature senescence [[cite:PUB00054069]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1sbx", "name" "Crystal structure of the Dachshund-homology domain of human SKI"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10005" "SKI ONCOGENE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription regulator SKI/SnoN", "short" "Tscrpt_reg_SKI_SnoN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 996, "taxa" 4046, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4902, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4902, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3092}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023216", :literature {"PUB00035365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Suzuki H" "Yagi K" "Kondo M" "Kato M" "Miyazono K" "Miyazawa K."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1207690", "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "c-Ski inhibits the TGF-beta signaling pathway through stabilization of inactive Smad complexes on Smad-binding elements.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "5068-76", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15107821}, "PUB00054069" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Pan D" "Zhu Q" "Luo K."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2009.250", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "SnoN functions as a tumour suppressor by inducing premature senescence.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3500-13", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19745809}, "PUB00054070" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Deheuninck J" "Luo K."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/cr.2008.324", "medline_journal" "Cell Res", "title" "Ski and SnoN, potent negative regulators of TGF-beta signaling.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "47-57", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19114989}, "PUB00054071" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Luo K."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
