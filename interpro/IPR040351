{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), including RAB3IL1/RAB3IP from animals, Sec2 from budding yeasts and Spo13 from fission yeasts. The mammalian guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab-3A (RAB3IL1) may activate RAB3A, a GTPase that regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis [[cite:PUB00073236]].  The Rab-3A-interacting protein (RAB3IP) may activate RAB8A and RAB8B, which reorganizes actin and microtubules to form new cell surface domains [[cite:PUB00090840]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rab guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec2 activates Sec4 by catalyzing the dissociation of GDP from Sec4. Activation of Sec4 by Sec2 is needed for the directed transport of vesicles to sites of exocytosis [[cite:PUB00012383]]. In the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, sporulation-specific protein 13 (Spo13) is required for sporulation.  During sporulation the spindle pole body (SPB) forms outer plaques, an essential precursor to the assembly of the forespore membrane (FSM). SPB associates with Spo13 and Spo2, and without these genes the SPB is not modified and the FSM does not form [[cite:PUB00090841]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14430" "RABIN3-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine nucleotide exchange factor RAB3IL/RAB3IP/Sec2", "short" "RAB3IL/RAB3IP/Sec2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2104, "taxa" 6590, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6909, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6909, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4325}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040351", :literature {"PUB00090840" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hattula K" "Furuhjelm J" "Arffman A" "Peranen J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
