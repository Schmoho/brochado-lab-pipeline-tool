{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Packaging of double-stranded viral DNA concatemers requires interaction of the prohead with virus DNA. This process is mediated by a phage-encoded DNA recognition and terminase protein. The terminase enzymes described so far, which are hetero-oligomers composed of a small and a large subunit, do not have a significant level of sequence homology. The small terminase subunit is thought to form a nucleoprotein structure that helps to position the terminase large subunit at the packaging initiation site [[cite:PUB00008403]]. The small terminase protein is essential for the initial recognition of viral DNA and regulates the motor's ATPase and nuclease activities during DNA translocation [[cite:PUB00057578]] and for switching between viral DNA replication and packaging. DNA packaging in tailed bacteriophages and in evolutionarily related herpesviruses is controlled by a viral-encoded terminase. The terminase complex characterised in Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages SF6 and SPP1 consists of two proteins: G1P and G2P [[cite:PUB00062503], [cite:PUB00067159]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zqo", "name" "Crystal structure of the small terminase oligomerization core domain from a SPP1-like bacteriophage (crystal form 3)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038713", "name" "Terminase small subunit, N-terminal DNA-binding domain, HTH motif superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03592" "Terminase small subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Terminase small subunit", "short" "Terminase_ssu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 40, "proteomes" 1293, "taxa" 7232, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7640, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7633, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4821}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005335", :literature {"PUB00008403" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Black LW."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
