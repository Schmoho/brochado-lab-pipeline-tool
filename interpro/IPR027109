{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of the SWR1-complex protein 4 (Swc4) from yeast, also known as EAF2, and its mammalian homologue DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1 (Dmap1) [[cite:PUB00063461]]. They are components of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, which is highly conserved in eukaryotes. NuA4 acetylates the nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A and plays primary roles in transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle control [[cite:PUB00035439], [cite:PUB00063467]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subunits of the NuA4 complex are shared by the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling SWR1 complex in yeast and its human orthologue, Snf 2-related CREB-binding protein (CBP) activator protein (SRCAP) complex. The mammalian NuA4 complex includes the SRCAP complex, and thus combines the functions of the yeast NuA4 and Swr1 complexes [[cite:PUB00063468]]. The SWR1/SRCAP complex mediates the ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2A for the H2A variant HZT1 leading to transcriptional regulation of selected genes by chromatin remodeling [[cite:PUB00046116], [cite:PUB00018537], [cite:PUB00063470]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4iej", "name" "Crystal structure of a DNA methyltransferase 1 associated protein 1 (DMAP1) from Homo sapiens at 1.45 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12855" "DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1 FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SWR1-complex protein 4/DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1", "short" "Swc4/Dmap1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2565, "taxa" 8710, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4621, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4621, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3036}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027109", :literature {"PUB00063470" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Ruhl DD" "Jin J" "Cai Y" "Swanson S" "Florens L" "Washburn MP" "Conaway RC" "Conaway JW" "Chrivia JC."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi060043d", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Purification of a human SRCAP complex that remodels chromatin by incorporating the histone variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "5671-7", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16634648}, "PUB00046116" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Krogan NJ" "Keogh MC" "Datta N" "Sawa C" "Ryan OW" "Ding H" "Haw RA" "Pootoolal J" "Tong A" "Canadien V" "Richards DP" "Wu X" "Emili A" "Hughes TR" "Buratowski S" "Greenblatt JF."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
