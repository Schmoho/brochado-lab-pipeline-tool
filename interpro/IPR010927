{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Six Tra proteins encoded by the F plasmid and required by F(+) cells to elaborate F pili. The six proteins are TraH, TraF, TraW, TraU, TrbI, and TrbB. Except for TrbI, these proteins were all identified as hallmarks of F-like type IV secretion systems (TFSSs), with no homologues among TFSS genes of P-type or I-type systems. With the exception of TrbI, which is an inner membrane protein, the remaining proteins are or are predicted to be periplasmic. TrbI consists of one membrane-spanning segment near its N terminus and an 88-residue, hydrophilic domain that extends into the periplasm [[cite:PUB00044763]].  It has been proposed that the TraH interaction group is to control F-pilus extension and retraction during conjugation [[cite:PUB00020459], [cite:PUB00044764], [cite:PUB00034400]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06122" "Conjugative relaxosome accessory transposon protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type IV conjugative transfer system protein TraH", "short" "T4SS_TraH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 394, "taxa" 2871, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3722, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3716, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2933}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0484", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0484"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010927", :literature {"PUB00044763" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Harris RL" "Silverman PM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
