{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry belong to the prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH) domain superfamily ([pfam:PF02153]). Members of this group catalyse a step in tyrosine biosynthesis in the shikimate pathway, which is present only in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants [[cite:PUB00015637]]. Many of the PDH enzymes are able to use the alternative intermediates of tyrosine biosynthesis, prephenate or L-arogenate, as substrates, having both prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase activities, and are sometimes collectively called cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenases [[cite:PUB00011046], [cite:PUB00016002]]. Arogenate dehydrogenase 2 has a weak prephenate dehydrogenase activity [[cite:PUB00011044]].</p>\n\n<p>Arabidopsis thaliana has two arogenate dehydrogenase isoforms, tyrAAT1 and tyrAAT2. TyrAAT1 is unusual in that it contains a duplication of the PDH domain. Both copies of the PDH domain have arogenate dehydrogenase activity with similar biochemical characteristics [[cite:PUB00011044]]. The experimentally studied plant enzymes are NADP-dependent arogenate dehydrogenases that are very sensitive toward feedback inhibition by the product of the reaction (tyrosine); in fact, they exhibit a higher affinity for tyrosine than for their arogenate substrate [[cite:PUB00011044]]. Interestingly, these proteins do not seem to have any additional domain that can be suggested to be responsible for this regulation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036577" "Arogenate/prephenate dehydrogenase, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arogenate dehydrogenase 2", "short" "Arogenate_DH_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 132, "taxa" 586, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 247, "sets" 0, "proteins" 243, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 147}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
