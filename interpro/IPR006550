{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase PNKP from animals. PNKP plays a key role in the repair of DNA damage, functioning as part of both the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and base excision repair (BER) pathways. It has been shown that the DNA 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP takes precedence over its DNA 5'-kinase activity in vitro [[cite:PUB00092582]]. It contains a forkhead-associated domain, which is a protein-protein interaction domain required for the association of PNKP with CK2-phosphorylated XRCC1 and XRCC4, and independent DNA 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase domains [[cite:PUB00092581]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3u7e", "name" "Crystal structure of mPNKP catalytic fragment (D170A)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01663" "bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase PNKP", "short" "PNKP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 363, "taxa" 1837, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 913, "sets" 0, "proteins" 913, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 548}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
