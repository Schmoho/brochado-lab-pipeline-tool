{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant bHLH transcription factors, including FAMA, SPEECHLESS and MUTE from Arabidopsis. These proteins have been shown to play important parts in stomatal lineage development. SPEECHLESS (SPCH) generates stem cells and promotes their asymmetric division while MUTE regulates the meristemoid to Guard Mother Cell (GMC) transition. FAMA confers guard cell (GC) fate and is expressed at the equal division producing the two young GCs, but not in mature stomata [[cite:PUB00095730], [cite:PUB00095727]].</p>\n\n<p>SPCH can be regulated through phosphorylation by MAPK-mediated and BIN2 (BR INSENSITIVE2). It has been suggested that SPCH integrates brassinosteroid and stomata signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00095728]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46684" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR FAMA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor FAMA/SPEECHLESS/MUTE-like", "short" "FAMA/SPEECHLESS/MUTE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 243, "taxa" 987, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3183, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3183, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1866}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044283", :literature {"PUB00095727" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lee E" "Lucas JR" "Goodrich J" "Sack FD."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Arabidopsis guard cell integrity involves the epigenetic stabilization of the FLP and FAMA transcription factor genes.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "566-77", "volume" "78", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24654956}, "PUB00095728" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Gudesblat GE" "Schneider-Pizon J" "Betti C" "Mayerhofer J" "Vanhoutte I" "van Dongen W" "Boeren S" "Zhiponova M" "de Vries S" "Jonak C" "Russinova E."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "title" "SPEECHLESS integrates brassinosteroid and stomata signalling pathways.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "548-54", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22466366}, "PUB00095730" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7127", "authors" ["MacAlister CA" "Ohashi-Ito K" "Bergmann DC."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Transcription factor control of asymmetric cell divisions that establish the stomatal lineage.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "537-40", "volume" "445", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17183265}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0010052", "name" "guard cell differentiation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044283", "name" "Transcription factor FAMA/SPEECHLESS/MUTE-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
