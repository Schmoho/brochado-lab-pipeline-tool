{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including FHY1 (At2g37678) from Arabidopsis. Phytochrome A (phyA) is the photoreceptor in Arabidopsis that mediates the far-red light high radiance response. AtFHY1 is a key regulator of far red/red (FR/R) spectrum-specific responses by regulating phyA shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and by directly regulating the expression of some target genes. AtFHY1 phosphorylation is induced by the R signal, is part of the FR/R spectrum sensing mechanism that ensures its optimal response to specific light quality [[cite:PUB00087580]]. AtFHY1 also has an independent role in gene modulation and plant development under far-red light [[cite:PUB00087581]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes FHL (FHY1 Like). FHL is essential for light-regulated PHYA nuclear accumulation and subsequent PHYA phototropic signaling processes [[cite:PUB00087583], [cite:PUB00087584], [cite:PUB00087585]]. The transcription of FHY1 and FHL are controlled by FHY3 (Far-red elongated HYpocotyl 3) and FAR1 (FAr-red impaired Response 1), a related pair of transcription factors [[cite:PUB00087582]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37723" "PROTEIN FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1", "short" "FHY1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 224, "taxa" 860, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 602, "sets" 0, "proteins" 602, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 354}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037766", :literature {"PUB00087580" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Chen F" "Shi X" "Chen L" "Dai M" "Zhou Z" "Shen Y" "Li J" "Li G" "Wei N" "Deng XW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.112.097733", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Phosphorylation of FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL1 is a key mechanism defining signaling dynamics of phytochrome A under red and far-red light in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1907-20", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22582101}, "PUB00087581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Chen F" "Li B" "Demone J" "Charron JB" "Shi X" "Deng XW."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
