{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of sequences represent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilise NAD ([ec:1.2.1.12]), NADP ([ec:1.2.1.13]) or either ([ec:1.2.1.59]). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilising forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively [[cite:PUB00009631]].  An additional form of gap gene is found in gammaproteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine [[cite:PUB00002270]]. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gammaproteobacteria [[cite:PUB00009725]]. This enzyme is described by [interpro:IPR006422]. These two groups of sequences exhibit a close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possibility that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to possess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity [[cite:PUB00009726]]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6uto", "name" "Native E. coli Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01534" "glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I", "short" "Glyceraldehyde-3-P_DH_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 231, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11805, "taxa" 46826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 67776, "sets" 0, "proteins" 67750, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 51347}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0691", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0691"} {"accession" "GenProp1691", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1691"} {"accession" "GenProp1736", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1736"} {"accession" "GenProp1306", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1306"} {"accession" "GenProp1599", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1599"} {"accession" "GenProp1344", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1344"} {"accession" "GenProp1612", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1612"} {"accession" "GenProp1407", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1407"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
