{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Fusarium oxysporum Avr2 effector protein ([swissprot:A0A0C4DI32]) and similar sequences from ascomycetes. Avr2 targets a conserved defence mechanism in different hosts. It also suppresses FLS2-mediated immune responses, such as growth inhibition, ROS production, MAPK activation and callose deposition following flagellin22 treatment [[cite:PUB00155505]]. Avr2 folds into a Î²-sandwich with some similarity to TRAF domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5od4", "name" "Avr2 effector protein from the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24180" "Effector protein Avr2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Effector protein Avr2-like", "short" "Avr2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 40, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056210", :literature {"PUB00155505" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Di X" "Cao L" "Hughes RK" "Tintor N" "Banfield MJ" "Takken FLW."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14733", "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "Structure-function analysis of the Fusarium oxysporum Avr2 effector allows uncoupling of its immune-suppressing activity from recognition.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "897-914", "volume" "216", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28857169}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056210", "name" "Effector protein Avr2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 3}}}
