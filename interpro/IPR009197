{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are involved in degradation of the cyanobacterial heptapeptide hepatotoxin microcystin LR, and are encoded in the mlr gene cluster [[cite:PUB00036077]]. MlrC from Sphingomonas wittichii  (strain RW1 / DSM 6014 / JCM 10273) is believed to mediate the last step of peptidolytic degradation of the tetrapeptide. It is suspected to be a metallopeptidase based on homology to known peptidases and its inhibition by metal chelators. The proteins encoded by the mlr cluster may be involved in cell wall peptidoglycan cycling and subsequently act fortuitously in hydrolysis of microcystin LR.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF012702" "Microcystin LR degradation protein MlrC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Microcystin LR degradation protein MlrC", "short" "MlrC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1475, "taxa" 5966, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8710, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8671, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6458}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009197", :literature {"PUB00036077" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Bourne DG" "Riddles P" "Jones GJ" "Smith W" "Blakeley RL."], "ISO_journal" "Environ.
