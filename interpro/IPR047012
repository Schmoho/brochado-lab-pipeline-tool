{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. They are important in inflammation, immune responses and in intracellular signalling events [[cite:PUB00009398]]. The ICAM family consists of five members, designated ICAM-1 to ICAM-5. They are known to bind to leucocyte integrins CD11/CD18 during inflammation and in immune responses. In addition, ICAMs may exist in soluble forms in human plasma, due to activation and proteolysis mechanisms at cell surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>ICAM-1 (CD54) contains five Ig-like domains. It is expressed on leucocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells, and is upregulated in response to bacterial invasion. The protein is a ligand for lymphocyte-function associated (LFA) antigens and also a receptor for CD11a,b/CD18, fibrinogen, human rhinovirus and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. ICAM-1 binding sites for CD11a/CD18 and its other binding partners are located in the first domain and are overlapping. ICAM-1 domain 2 seems to play an important role in maintaining the conformation of domain 1 and particularly the structural integrity of the LFA-1 ligand-binding site [[cite:PUB00009399]].</p>\n\n<p>The 3-dimensional atomic structure of the tandem N-terminal Ig-like domains (D1 and D2) of ICAM-1 has been determined to 2.2A resolution and fitted into a cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of a rhinovirus-ICAM-1 complex [[cite:PUB00009400]]. Extensive charge interactions between ICAM-1 and human rhinovirusesare largely conserved in major and minor receptor groups of rhinoviruses. The interaction of ICAMs with LFA-1 is mediated by a divalent cation bound to the insertion (I)-domain on the alpha chain of LFA-1 and the carboxyl group of a conserved glutamic acid residue on ICAMs.</p>\n\n<p>ICAM-2 (CD102) has two Ig-like domains. It is expressed on endothelial cells, leucocytes and platelets, and binds to CD11a'b/CD18. The protein is refractory to proinflammatory cytokines, and plays an important role in the adhesion of leucocytes to the uninduced endothelium [[cite:PUB00007637]].</p>\n\n<p>ICAM-3 (CD50) contains five Ig-like domains and binds to leucocyte integrins CD11a'd/CD18. The protein plays an important role in the immune response and perhaps in signal transduction [[cite:PUB00007638]].</p>\n\n<p>ICAM-4 (LW blood group Ag) is red blood cell (RBC) specific and binds to CD11a'b/CD18. It is associated with the RBC Rh antigens and could be important in retaining immature red cells in the bone marrow, or in the uptake of senescent cells into the spleen [[cite:PUB00007639]].</p>\n\n<p>ICAM-5 (telencephalin) has nine Ig-like domains and is confined to the telencephalon of the brain. The role of this CD11a/CD18 binding molecule is not yet known [[cite:PUB00007640]].</p>\n\n<p>VCAM-1 was first described as a cytokine-inducible endothelial adhesion molecule. It can bind to leucocyte integrin VL-4 (very late antigen-4) to recruit leucocytes to sites of inflammation [[cite:PUB00007641]]. The predominant form of VCAM-1 in vivo has an N-terminal extracellular region comprising seven Ig-like domains [[cite:PUB00007642]]. A conserved integrin-binding motif has been identified in domains 1 and 4, variants of which are present in the N-terminal domain of all members of the integrin-binding subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The structure of a VLA-4-binding fragment comprising the first two domains of VCAM-1 has been determined to 1.8A resolution. The integrin-binding motif is exposed and forms the N-terminal region of the loop between Î²-strands C and D of domain 1 [[cite:PUB00007642]]. VCAM-1 domains 1 and 2 are structurally similar to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 [[cite:PUB00007641]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1vca", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF AN INTEGRIN-BINDING FRAGMENT OF VASCULAR CELL ADHESION MOLECULE-1 AT 1.8 ANGSTROMS RESOLUTION"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13771" "INTERCELLULAR ADHESION MOLECULE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Intercellular adhesion molecule/vascular cell adhesion molecule", "short" "ICAM_VCAM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 585, "taxa" 2034, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5095, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3178}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047012", :literature {"PUB00009400" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Bella J" "Kolatkar PR" "Marlor CW" "Greve JM" "Rossmann MG."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
