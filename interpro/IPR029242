{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Melan-A, also known as melanoma antigen recognised by T-cells 1, or MART-1, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MLANA gene. It is required for the function of the melanosomal matrix protein PMEL17/GP100 and thus plays an important role in regulating mammalian pigmentation [[cite:PUB00069924]]. Melan-A is a member of the MAGE gene family [[cite:PUB00007179]] and is a tumour associated antigen. Clinically, the protein may serve as an anti-cancer vaccine [[cite:PUB00069927]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14991" "Protein melan-A"}, "panther" {"PTHR15305" "MELANOMA ANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY T-CELLS 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein melan-A", "short" "MLANA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 502, "taxa" 1808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 653, "sets" 0, "proteins" 638, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 440}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029242", :literature {"PUB00069924" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Hoashi T" "Watabe H" "Muller J" "Yamaguchi Y" "Vieira WD" "Hearing VJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
