{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes FKBP6 from mammals and protein shutdown (shu) from flies. FKBP6 is a testis-sperm specific protein that belongs to the immunophilins FKBP family known to be involved in meiosis, calcium homeostasis, clathrin-coated vesicles, and membrane fusions [[cite:PUB00092834]]. FKBP6 contains a PPIase FKBP-type domain and a TPR domain. However, it is inactive as an isomerase and associates with Hsp90 via its TPR domain [[cite:PUB00092837]]. Protein shutdown is essential for the formation of germline cysts during oogenesis [[cite:PUB00092835]] and is a component of the Drosophila piRNA biogenesis machinery [[cite:PUB00092836]]. This entry also includes the FKBP6 homologue found in Dictyostelium discoideum.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46674" "INACTIVE PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE FKBP6"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inactive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP6/shutdown", "short" "FKBP6/shu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 923, "taxa" 3962, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1802, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1802, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1206}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
