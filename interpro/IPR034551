{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mucin-20 (MUC20) was identifiied as a gene that is up-regulated in the renal tissues of patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy [[cite:PUB00083701]]. It is a regulator of the Met signaling cascade. MUC20 associates with Met which is the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, and has a role in suppressing the Grb2-Ras pathway. Production of MUC20 reduced HGF-induced matrix metalloproteinase expression and proliferation, which require the Grb2-Ras pathway [[cite:PUB00052449]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37358" "MUCIN-20"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mucin-20", "short" "MUC20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 119, "taxa" 402, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 271, "sets" 0, "proteins" 271, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 166}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034551", :literature {"PUB00083701" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Higuchi T" "Orita T" "Nakanishi S" "Katsuya K" "Watanabe H" "Yamasaki Y" "Waga I" "Nanayama T" "Yamamoto Y" "Munger W" "Sun HW" "Falk RJ" "Jennette JC" "Alcorta DA" "Li H" "Yamamoto T" "Saito Y" "Nakamura M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
