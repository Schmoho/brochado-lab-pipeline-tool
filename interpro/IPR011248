VanT, a membrane-bound serine racemase, is one of three proteins essential for this resistance. VanT also has alanine racemase activity but it is able to racemize serine more efficiently than alanine. It requires pyridoxal phosphate for activity and there is a highly conserved pyridoxal phosphate attachment site in the C-terminal domain, typical of alanine racemases [[cite:PUB00014498]]. The N-terminal domain contains 10 predicted transmembrane segments and is likely to be involved in the transport of L-Ser, and that in its absence the vancomycin resistance phenotype is compromised [[cite:PUB00014380]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036464" "Serine/alanine racemase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine/alanine racemase", "short" "Serine/alanine_racemase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 78, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 43}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
