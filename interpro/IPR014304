{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is a group of RNA polymerase sigma factors where one of the members is designated as SigZ in Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00034428]]. This group has a very sporadic distribution, B. subtilis, for instance, being the only sequenced strain of Bacilli with a member Dechloromonas aromatica (strain RCB), that appears to have two of these sigma factors. A member of which appears on a plasmid found in Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Vibrio fischeri (strain ATCC 700601 / ES114), where a second one is chromosomally encoded.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02959" "RNA polymerase sigma factor SigZ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase sigma-Z type", "short" "RNA_pol_sigma-Z"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 221, "taxa" 1376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 875, "sets" 0, "proteins" 875, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 677}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014304", :literature {"PUB00034428" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sorokin A" "Bolotin A" "Purnelle B" "Hilbert H" "Lauber J" "Dusterhoft A" "Ehrlich SD."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis genome region in the vicinity of the lev operon reveals two new extracytoplasmic function RNA polymerase sigma factors SigV and SigZ.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "2939-43", "volume" "143 ( Pt 9)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9308178}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014304", "name" "RNA polymerase sigma-Z type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
