{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including DIR1 (At5g48485) from Arabidopsis. AtDIR1 is an acidic lipid transfer protein essential for systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which is a defence mechanism that induces protection against a wide range of pathogens in distant, pathogen-free parts of plants after a primary inoculation [[cite:PUB00089380]]. Upon SAR induction, DIR1 moves from locally infected to distant uninfected leaves to activate defense priming [[cite:PUB00089379]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2rkn", "name" "X-ray structure of the self-defense and signaling protein DIR1 from Arabidopsis taliana"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036312", "name" "Bifunctional inhibitor/plant lipid transfer protein/seed storage helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33122" "LIPID BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative lipid-transfer protein DIR1-like", "short" "DIR1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 245, "taxa" 961, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3456, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3456, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2172}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039265", :literature {"PUB00089380" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Adam AL" "Nagy ZA" "Katay G" "Mergenthaler E" "Viczian O."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19041146", "medline_journal" "Int J Mol Sci", "title" "Signals of Systemic Immunity in Plants: Progress and Open Questions.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29642641}, "PUB00089379" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Isaacs M" "Carella P" "Faubert J" "Rose JK" "Cameron RK."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.00566", "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "Orthology Analysis and In Vivo Complementation Studies to Elucidate the Role of DIR1 during Systemic Acquired Resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "566", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27200039}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005504", "name" "fatty acid binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009627", "name" "systemic acquired resistance", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR039265", "name" "Putative lipid-transfer protein DIR1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
