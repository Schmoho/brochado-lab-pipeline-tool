{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes TraF; a protein that is part of a large group of proteins involved in conjugative transfer of plasmid DNA, specifically in the F-type system. TraF has been predicted to contain a thioredoxin fold and has been shown to be localized to the periplasm [[cite:PUB00034397]]. Unlike the related protein TrbB ([interpro:IPR014109]), TraF does not contain a conserved pair of cysteines and has been shown not to function as a thiol disulphide isomerase by complementation of an Escherichia coli DsbA defect [[cite:PUB00034395]]. The protein is believed to be involved in pilin assembly [[cite:PUB00034396]]. Even more closely related than TrbB is a clade of genes ([interpro:IPR014111]), which do contain the CXXC motif, but it is unclear whether these are involved in type-F conjugation systems per se.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02739" "type-F conjugative transfer system pilin assembly protein TraF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type-F conjugative transfer system pilin assembly protein TraF", "short" "TraF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 629, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 992, "sets" 0, "proteins" 992, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 772}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0484", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0484"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014110", :literature {"PUB00034397" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Wu JH" "Kathir P" "Ippen-Ihler K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
