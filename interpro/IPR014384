{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) ([ec:2.7.7.48]) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [[cite:PUB00033622], [cite:PUB00033623]]. It catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear.\r\nThe postulated RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA synthesis begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the addition of a nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTP) to the 3'-OH of the first initiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the complementary RNA product [[cite:PUB00033624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents a RNA-directed RNA polymerase, Orthobunyavirus type.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000824" "RNA-directed RNA polymerase, Orthobunyavirus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-directed RNA polymerase, orthobunyavirus", "short" "RNA-dir_pol_orthobunyavirus"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 17, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36, "sets" 0, "proteins" 36, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
