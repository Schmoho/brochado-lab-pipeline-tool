{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription initiation Spt4 proteins. Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription via the modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association of the Spt4-Spt5 complex with Spt6 is considerably weaker. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles [[cite:PUB00012261]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3h7h", "name" "Crystal structure of the human transcription elongation factor DSIF, hSpt4/hSpt5 (176-273)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029040", "name" "RNA polymerase subunit RPABC4/transcription elongation factor Spt4", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038510", "name" "Spt4 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF025023" "Transcription elongation factor Spt4"}, "panther" {"PTHR12882" "SUPPRESSOR OF TY 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation Spt4", "short" "Spt4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2496, "taxa" 8582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4015, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3983, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2660}, "pathways" 40}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009287", :literature {"PUB00012261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Winston F."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11182892", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "Control of eukaryotic transcription elongation.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS1006", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11182892}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0140673", "name" "transcription elongation-coupled chromatin remodeling", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009287", "name" "Transcription initiation Spt4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
