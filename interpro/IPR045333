{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ARMET, also known as mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) or arginine-rich protein,  is a small protein of approximately 170 residues which contains four di-sulphide bridges that are highly conserved from nematodes to humans. It is a soluble protein resident in the endoplasmic reticulum and induced by ER stress. It appears to be involved with dealing with mis-folded proteins in the ER, thus in quality control of ER stress [[cite:PUB00044154]]. ARMET from Rattus norvegicus (Rat) selectively promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral mid-brain. It modulates GABAergic transmission to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, and enhances spontaneous, as well as evoked, GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in dopaminergic neurons [[cite:PUB00045443]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes the related neurotrophic factor CDNF (cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor) [[cite:PUB00089656]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6h9u", "name" "Crystal structure of the BiP NBD and MANF SAP complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12990" "ARMET-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ARMET-like", "short" "ARMET-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1040, "taxa" 4302, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2025, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2025, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1379}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045333", :literature {"PUB00044154" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Mizobuchi N" "Hoseki J" "Kubota H" "Toyokuni S" "Nozaki J" "Naitoh M" "Koizumi A" "Nagata K."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Struct.
