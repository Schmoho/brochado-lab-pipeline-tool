{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The only essential histone acetyltransferase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NuA4, acetylates the N-terminal tails of histones H4 and H2A. Experimental analyses have revealed at least two functionally distinct polypeptide groups in NuA4: Vid21/Yng2 and Eaf5/Eaf7. While the former are required for bulk histone H4 acetylation and are functionally linked to the histone H2A variant Htz1 and the Swr1 ATPase complex (SWR-C) that assembles Htz1 into chromatin, Eaf5 and Eaf7 have an, as yet, undefined role. It is thought that a NuA4/SWR-C/Htz1 pathway may regulate both transcription and centromere function in S.cerevisiae [[cite:PUB00016517]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02067" "Chromatin modification-related protein EAF5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromatin modification-related protein EAF5", "short" "EAF5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 99, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 212, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 46}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026226", :literature {"PUB00016517" {"URL" nil, "issue" "37", "authors" ["Krogan NJ" "Baetz K" "Keogh MC" "Datta N" "Sawa C" "Kwok TC" "Thompson NJ" "Davey MG" "Pootoolal J" "Hughes TR" "Emili A" "Buratowski S" "Hieter P" "Greenblatt JF."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
