{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins associated with the urea carboxylase/allophanate hydrolase pathway, an alternative to urease for urea degradation. These proteins are specific to bacteria with the urea degradation pathway and are encoded close to the urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase genes. The substrate for this transporter is therefore likely to be urea or a compound from which urea is easily derived.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03427" "putative urea ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, urea utilisation-associated, substrate-binding protein", "short" "ABC_transptr_urea-assoc_sub-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 479, "taxa" 2489, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2234, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1773}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0481", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0481"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017793", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017793", "name" "ABC transporter, urea utilisation-associated, substrate-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
