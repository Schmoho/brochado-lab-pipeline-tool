{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins is comprised entirely of phosphatidylinositol 3- and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) [[cite:PUB00000875]] is an enzyme that phosphorylates phosphoinositides on the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring. The three products of PI3-kinase, PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P(2) and PI-3,4,5-P(3), function as secondary messengers in cell signalling. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4-kinase) [[cite:PUB00001254]] acts on phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the first committed step of the production of the secondary messenger inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. The PI3- and PI4-kinases share a well-conserved domain at their C-terminal section, which is distantly related to the catalytic domain of protein kinases [[cite:PUB00000893], [cite:PUB00007087]]. The catalytic domain of PI3K has a bilobal structure with a small N-terminal lobe and a large C-terminal lobe; this structure is often found in other ATP-dependent kinases. The core of this catalytic domain is the most conserved region of the PI3Ks. The ATP cofactor binds in the crevice formed by the N-and C-terminal lobes, a loop between two strands provides a hydrophobic pocket for binding of the adenine moiety, and a lysine residue interacts with the alpha-phosphate. In contrast to other protein kinases, the PI3K loop interacts with the phosphates of the ATP, known as the glycine-rich or P-loop, contains no glycine residues. Instead, contact with the ATP -phosphate is maintained through the side chain of a conserved serine residue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4uwh", "name" "Discovery of (2S)-8-((3R)-3-Methylmorpholin-4-yl)-1-(3-methyl-2-oxo- butyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimido(1,2-a)pyrimidin-6- one: a Novel Potent and Selective Inhibitor of Vps34 for the Treatment of Solid Tumors"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042236", "name" "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, accessory (PIK) domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10048" "PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL KINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylinositol kinase", "short" "PI_Kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 356, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2746, "taxa" 9752, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30408, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30408, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14182}, "pathways" 276}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2088", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2088"} {"accession" "GenProp2090", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2090"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
