{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase ([ec:5.1.99.1]), also called methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. This enzyme converts (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then a substrate for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ([interpro:IPR004608]). It is known in bacteria, archaea, and as a mitochondrial protein in animals. It is closely related to lactoylglutathione lyase ([interpro:IPR004361]), which is also called glyoxylase I, and is also a homodimer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rmu", "name" "Crystal structure of human Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, MCEE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029068", "name" "Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03081" "methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase"}, "cdd" {"cd07249" "Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MMCE)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase", "short" "MeMalonyl-CoA_epimerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5431, "taxa" 19291, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15425}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1439", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1439"} {"accession" "GenProp1629", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1629"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
