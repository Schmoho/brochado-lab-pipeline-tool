{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes animal Pre-mRNA-processing factor 19 (Prp19) and its homologues. Prp19 is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase with pleiotropic activities in DNA damage signalling, repair, and replicative senescence. It functions as a critical component of DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint complexes. It senses DNA damage, binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner, facilitates processing of damaged DNA, promotes DNA end joining, regulates replication protein A (RPA2) phosphorylation and ubiquitination at damaged DNA, and regulates RNA splicing and mitotic spindle formation in its integral capacity as a scaffold for a multimeric core complex [[cite:PUB00137580], [cite:PUB00078520], [cite:PUB00090460], [cite:PUB00039586], [cite:PUB00137582]]. Human Prp19 is part of the nineteen complex (NTC), which acts as a multimeric E3 ubiquitin ligase in DNA repair and splicing. Prp19 forms a homotetramer and is an autoinhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase; its activation requires its interaction with splicing factors SPF27, CDC5L, and PLRG1 [[cite:PUB00088605]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5m89", "name" "Spliceosome component"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43995" "PRE-MRNA-PROCESSING FACTOR 19"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-processing factor 19", "short" "Prp19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 49, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2579, "taxa" 8787, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5055, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5055, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3300}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
