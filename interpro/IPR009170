{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PRDM2  (also known as RIZ)  is a transcriptional regulator and tumour suppressor that catalyzes methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3. Its PR domain is responsible for its catalytic activity  [[cite:PUB00048100]]. PRDM2 belongs to the PRDM family, whose members are characterised by the presence of an N-terminal PR (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ1 homology) domain followed by multiple zinc fingers which confer DNA binding activity. PR domains are only distantly related to the classical SET methyltransferase domains [[cite:PUB00095964]]. PRDM2 interacts with another tumour suppressor, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). A short motif, IRCDE, in the acidic region (AR) of RIZ is important for this interaction [[cite:PUB00095965]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002395" "Predicted retinoblastoma binding protein (RIZ)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PR domain zinc finger protein 2", "short" "PRDM2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 297, "taxa" 1058, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 840, "sets" 0, "proteins" 732, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
