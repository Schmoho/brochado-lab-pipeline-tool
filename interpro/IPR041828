{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Rab24 is distinct from other Rabs in several ways. It exists primarily in the GTP-bound state, having a low intrinsic GTPase activity; it is not efficiently geranyl-geranylated at the C terminus; it does not form a detectable complex with Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs); and it has recently been shown to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation when overexpressed in vitro [[cite:PUB00091904], [cite:PUB00091905]]. The specific function of Rab24 still remains unknown. It is found in a transport route between ER-cis-Golgi and late endocytic compartments. It is putatively involved in an autophagic pathway, possibly directing misfolded proteins in the ER to degradative pathways [[cite:PUB00091903]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04118" "Rab GTPase family 24 (Rab24)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab24", "short" "Rab24"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 438, "taxa" 1642, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 462}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041828", :literature {"PUB00020223" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Stenmark H" "Olkkonen VM."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11387043&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The Rab GTPase family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS3007", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11387043}, "PUB00033000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Dumas JJ" "Zhu Z" "Connolly JL" "Lambright DG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80054-9", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural basis of activation and GTP hydrolysis in Rab proteins.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "413-23", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10196122}, "PUB00091903" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Egami Y" "Kiryu-Seo S" "Yoshimori T" "Kiyama H."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
