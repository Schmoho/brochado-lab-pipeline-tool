It is subsequently cleaved by AbgA and AbgB (sometimes referred to as AbgAB) [[cite:PUB00060288], [cite:PUB00033912]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037227" "Aminobenzoyl-glutamate utilization protein B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminobenzoyl-glutamate utilization protein B", "short" "Aminobenzoyl-glu_utiliz_pB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 952, "taxa" 4536, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5845, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3932}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1119", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1119"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
