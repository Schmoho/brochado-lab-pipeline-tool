{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>F420 (or 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin) is a coenzyme involved in redox reactions in methanogens.  A Genome Properties metabolic reconstruction for F420 biosynthesis shows that slightly over 10 percent of all prokaryotes with fully sequenced genomes, including about two thirds of the Actinomycetales, make F420. This subfamily within the PPOX family occurs in at least 19 distinct species of F420 producers and is likely to bind F420 rather than FMN (flavin mononucleotide or riboflavin-5'-phosphate). The member OxyR was shown in<i>Streptomyces rimosus</i>to use F420 to catalyze a C5a-C11a reduction in tetracycline or oxytetracycline biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00055044], [cite:PUB00067298]], and OxyR is also known as 5a,11a-dehydrotetracycline/5a,11a-dehydrooxytetracycline reductase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012349", "name" "FMN-binding split barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04023" "PPOX class F420-dependent oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PPOX class F420-dependent enzyme, MSMEG_5819/OxyR family", "short" "MSMEG_5819/OxyR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 457, "taxa" 1579, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1795, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1357}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0002", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0002"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
