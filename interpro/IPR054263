{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of uncharacterised bacterial proteins. They are probably remotely related to His-Me finger endonucleases. The conservation of the putative active site residues in this family is not strict, in particular the position of the catalytic histidine.  The residues involved in metal coordination are conserved. The presence in the vicinity of two invariant aspartate residues that point toward the putative active site suggests that these proteins may still function as enzymes but probably via a somewhat different catalytic mechanism. They may still retain their catalytic activity by employing these conserved aspartates that in the predicted AF2 models are well positioned to undertake a role in a potential nucleophilic attack.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22507" "Family of unknown function (DUF6994)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6994", "short" "DUF6994"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 98, "taxa" 794, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 444, "sets" 0, "proteins" 443, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 328}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054263", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054263", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6994", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 59, "alignment:full" 109}}}
