{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents tellurite resistance protein TehA. TehA belongs to the C4-dicarboxylate transporter/malic acid transport (TDT) protein family and is a homologue of plant Slow Anion Channel-Associated 1 (SLAC1) [[cite:PUB00066753]]. The tehA gene encodes an integral membrane protein that has been shown to have efflux activity on quaternary ammonium compounds. TehA protein of Escherichia coli functions as a tellurite-resistance uptake permease [[cite:PUB00062355], [cite:PUB00089377]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3m73", "name" "Crystal Structure of Plant SLAC1 homolog TehA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038665", "name" "Voltage-dependent anion channel superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd09324" "Tellurite-resistance/Dicarboxylate Transporter (TDT) family includes TehA protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tellurite resistance protein TehA", "short" "TehA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 130, "taxa" 1302, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1393, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1393, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1083}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039264", :literature {"PUB00089377" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Walter EG" "Weiner JH" "Taylor DE."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(91)90217-Y", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Nucleotide sequence and overexpression of the tellurite-resistance determinant from the IncHII plasmid pHH1508a.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "1-7", "volume" "101", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2060788}, "PUB00066753" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7319", "authors" ["Chen YH" "Hu L" "Punta M" "Bruni R" "Hillerich B" "Kloss B" "Rost B" "Love J" "Siegelbaum SA" "Hendrickson WA."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09487", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Homologue structure of the SLAC1 anion channel for closing stomata in leaves.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1074-80", "volume" "467", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20981093}, "PUB00062355" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Turner RJ" "Taylor DE" "Weiner JH."], "ISO_journal" "Antimicrob.
