{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sec1-like molecules have been implicated in a variety of eukaryotic vesicle transport processes including neurotransmitter release by exocytosis [[cite:PUB00003457]]. They regulate vesicle transport by binding to a t-SNARE from the syntaxin family. This process is thought to prevent SNARE complex formation, a protein complex required for membrane fusion. Whereas Sec1 molecules are essential for neurotransmitter release and other secretory events, their interaction with syntaxin molecules seems to represent a negative regulatory step in secretion [[cite:PUB00007149]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6xjl", "name" "Structure of the SM protein Vps45"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036045", "name" "Sec1-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043154", "name" "Sec1-like, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027482", "name" "Sec1-like, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043127", "name" "Sec1-like, domain 3a", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043155", "name" "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 33, domain 3b", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11679" "VESICLE PROTEIN SORTING-ASSOCIATED"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005715" "Vesicle trafficking protein, VPS45/Sec1 type"}, "pfam" {"PF00995" "Sec1 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sec1-like protein", "short" "Sec1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 410, "proteomes" 2737, "taxa" 9487, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31002, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30101, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19007}, "pathways" 84}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001619", :literature {"PUB00007149" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Bracher A" "Perrakis A" "Dresbach T" "Betz H" "Weissenhorn W."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00156-8", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The X-ray crystal structure of neuronal Sec1 from squid sheds new light on the role of this protein in exocytosis.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "685-94", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10903948}, "PUB00003457" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Halachmi N" "Lev Z."], "ISO_journal" "J.
