{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents lipase estA and extracellular esterase estB. Lipase estA (also known as lipase LipA) was initially identified in Bacillus subtilis as a lipase that was active toward p-nitrophenyl esters and triacylglycerides, displaying a marked preference for esters with C8 acyl groups [[cite:PUB00055581]]. A second, secreted lipase (LipB) was then identified in Pseudomonas fluorescens [[cite:PUB00060772]]. However, it is likely that this second enzyme functions as an esterase, rather than a lipase [[cite:PUB00060773]]. It has therefore been renamed extracellular esterase estB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2x5x", "name" "The crystal structure of PhaZ7 at atomic (1.2 Angstrom) resolution reveals details of the active site and suggests a substrate binding mode"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32015" "FASTING INDUCED LIPASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01674" "Lipase (class 2)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipase EstA/Esterase EstB", "short" "Lipase_EstA/Esterase_EstB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 38, "domain_architectures" 83, "proteomes" 1442, "taxa" 4979, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7507, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7430, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5230}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
