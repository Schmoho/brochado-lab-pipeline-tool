{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The PEBP (PhosphatidylEthanolamine-Binding Protein) family is a highly conserved group of proteins that have been identified in numerous tissues in a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, nematodes, plants, drosophila and mammals. The various functions described for members of this family include lipid binding, neuronal development [[cite:PUB00010657]], serine protease inhibition [[cite:PUB00010659]], the control of the morphological switch between shoot growth and flower structures [[cite:PUB00010660]], and the regulation of several signalling pathways such as the MAP kinase pathway [[cite:PUB00010662]], and the NF-kappaB pathway [[cite:PUB00010663]]. The control of the latter two pathways involves the PEBP protein RKIP, which interacts with MEK and Raf-1 to inhibit the MAP kinase pathway , and with TAK1, NIK, IKKalpha and IKKbeta to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway.  Other PEBP-like proteins that show strong structural homology to PEBP include Escherichia coli YBHB and YBCL [[cite:PUB00015041]], the Rattus norvegicus (Rat) neuropeptide HCNP, and Antirrhinum majus (Garden snapdragon) protein centroradialis (CEN). Although their overall structures are similar, the members of the PEBP family bind very different substrates including phospholipids, opioids, and hydrophobic odorant molecules as well as having different oligomerization states (monomer/dimer/tetramer).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n08", "name" "Crystal Structure of a Putative PhosphatidylEthanolamine-Binding Protein (PEBP) Homolog CT736 from Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW-3/CX"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036610", "name" "PEBP-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01161" "Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein", "short" "PEBP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 121, "domain_architectures" 325, "proteomes" 6917, "taxa" 28027, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43395, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43267, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31326}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008914", :literature {"PUB00010657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Vallee BS" "Coadou G" "Labbe H" "Sy D" "Vovelle F" "Schoentgen F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
