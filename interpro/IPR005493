{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the regulator of ribonuclease E activity A (RraA). These proteins contain a swivelling 3-layer β/β/α domain that appears to be mobile in most multi-domain proteins known to contain it. These proteins are structurally similar, and may have distant homology, to the phosphohistidine domain of pyruvate phosphate dikinase. The RraA fold is an ancient platform that has been adapted for a wide range of functions. RraA had been identified as a putative demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase and was annotated as MenG, but further analysis showed that RraA lacked the structural motifs usually required for methylases [[cite:PUB00017730]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1q5x", "name" "Structure of OF RRAA (MENG), a protein inhibitor of RNA processing"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036704", "name" "Ribonuclease E inhibitor RraA/RraA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16841" "ribonuclease activity regulator RraA family"}, "pfam" {"PF03737" "Aldolase/RraA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease E inhibitor RraA/RraA-like protein", "short" "RraA/RraA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 154, "proteomes" 6202, "taxa" 23409, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 44946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 44700, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33692}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
