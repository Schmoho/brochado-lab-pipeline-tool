{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar short proteins, of 50-90 residues in length, predominantly found in Actinobacteria. Pup is covalently conjugated to the e-NH2 groups of lysines on several target proteins (pupylation) such as the malonyl CoA acyl carrier protein (FabD) [[cite:PUB00053383]]. Pupylation of FabD was shown to result in its recruitment to the mycobacterial proteasome and subsequent degradation analogous to eukaryotic ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Searches recovered Pup orthologous in all major actinobacteria lineages including the basal bifidobacteria and also sporadically in certain other bacterial lineages [[cite:PUB00053382]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this protein family, formerly known as DUF797, have a conserved motif with a G [EQ] signature at the C terminus and are suitable for conjugation via the terminal glutamate or the deamidated glutamine (as shown in the case of the Mycobacterium Pup [[cite:PUB00053382]]). Pup is structurally unrelated to the ubiquitin fold and has convergently evolved the function of protein modifier. It has a binding-induced folding recognition mechanism that is different from substrate recognition in the ubiquitin-proteasome system [[cite:PUB00055264]]. This protein, intrinsically disordered, links to target proteins via the ligase PafA, acquiring an ordered assembly to form two helices connected by a linker, positioning the C-terminal glutamate in the active site of this ligase [[cite:PUB00100051]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7oxy", "name" "Crystal structure of depupylase Dop in complex with Pup and AMP-PCP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03687" "ubiquitin-like protein Pup"}, "pfam" {"PF05639" "Pup-like protein"}, "hamap" {"MF_02106" "Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup [pup]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup", "short" "Ubiquitin-like_Pup"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 1652, "taxa" 4887, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4942, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4942, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3850}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0833", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0833"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008515", :literature {"PUB00053383" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5904", "authors" ["Pearce MJ" "Mintseris J" "Ferreyra J" "Gygi SP" "Darwin KH."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1163885", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Ubiquitin-like protein involved in the proteasome pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1104-7", "volume" "322", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18832610}, "PUB00053382" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Burroughs AM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
