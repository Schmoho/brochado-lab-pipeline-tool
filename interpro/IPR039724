{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents WDR91 and its homologues. WDR91 is part of the WDR81-WDR91 complex that functions as a negative regulator of the PI3 kinase/PI3K activity associated with endosomal membranes via BECN1, a core subunit of the PI3K complex. WDR91 has been shown to be recruited to endosomes by interacting with active guanosine triphosophate-Rab7 and inhibits Rab7-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity [[cite:PUB00090016]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes Sorf-1, a WDR91 homologue from C. elegans. Sorf-1 and Sorf-2 form a complex with Beclin1 and inhibit the activity of the PI3K complex [[cite:PUB00090016]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8kb9", "name" "Structure of the WDR91 WD40 domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13083" "WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 91"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein 91", "short" "WDR91"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1036, "taxa" 4108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2130, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2130, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1329}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039724", :literature {"PUB00090016" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Liu K" "Jian Y" "Sun X" "Yang C" "Gao Z" "Zhang Z" "Liu X" "Li Y" "Xu J" "Jing Y" "Mitani S" "He S" "Yang C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
