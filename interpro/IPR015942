{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of related proteins that includes aspartate racemase, glutamate racemase, hydantoin racemase and arylmalonate decarboxylase. Two conserved cysteines are present in the sequence of these enzymes. They play a role in catalytic activity by acting as bases in proton abstraction from the substrate [[cite:PUB00083212], [cite:PUB00055747], [cite:PUB00094355]].</p>\n\n<p>Aspartate racemase ([ec:5.1.1.13]) and glutamate racemase ([ec:5.1.1.3]) are two evolutionary related bacterial enzymes that do not seem to require a cofactor for their activity [[cite:PUB00000380]]. Glutamate racemase, which interconverts L-glutamate into D-glutamate, is required for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and some peptide-based antibiotics such as gramicidin S. The E.coli L-aspartate/glutamate specific racemase Ygea, which was previously an hypothetical protein, has been shown to have racemase activity for both L-glutamate and L-aspartate with higher preference for L-glutamate [[cite:PUB00094355]].</p>\n\n<p>Hydantoin racemases catalyse the racemization of various 5-substituted hydantoins. The structure of the allantoin racemase from Klebsiella pneumoniae has been solved [[cite:PUB00055747]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ojc", "name" "Crystal structure of a putative Asp/Glu Racemase from Yersinia pestis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR001920", "name" "Asp/Glu racemase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01177" "Asp/Glu/Hydantoin racemase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Asp/Glu/hydantoin racemase", "short" "Asp/Glu/hydantoin_racemase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 153, "proteomes" 9689, "taxa" 37027, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 74507, "sets" 0, "proteins" 73981, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 56571}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1448", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1448"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
