{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of TraC-related proteins is conserved in Proteobacteria. TraC is a cytoplasmic, peripheral membrane protein and is one of the proteins encoded by the F transfer region of the conjugative plasmid that is required for the assembly of F pilin into the mature F pilus structure. F pili are filamentous appendages that help establish the physical contact between donor and recipient cells involved in the conjugation process [[cite:PUB00059160]]. This family also includes predicted ATPases associated with DNA conjugal transfer. These are found both in plasmids and in bacterial chromosomal regions that appear to derive from integrative elements such as conjugative transposons.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11130" "TraC protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type-IV secretion system protein TraC/Conjugative transfer ATPase", "short" "TraC/Conjuga_ATPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 39, "proteomes" 553, "taxa" 4169, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6121, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4741}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025955", :literature {"PUB00059160" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Schandel KA" "Muller MM" "Webster RE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
