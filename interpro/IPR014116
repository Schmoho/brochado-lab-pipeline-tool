{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Member of this ferredoxin-like protein family, include FixG, CcoG and RdxA,. They are found exclusively in species with an operon encoding the cbb3 type of cytochrome c oxidase (cco-cbb3), and near the cco-cbb3 operon in about half the cases. The cco-cbb3 is found in a variety of proteobacteria and almost nowhere else; it is associated with oxygen use under microaerobic conditions. Some (but not all) of these proteobacteria are also nitrogen-fixing, hence the gene symbol fixG. FixG was shown essential for functional cco-cbb3 expression in Bradyrhizobium japonicum [[cite:PUB00017603]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02745" "cytochrome c oxidase accessory protein CcoG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase cbb3 type, accessory protein FixG", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_cbb3_FixG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2943, "taxa" 10945, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13689, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13689, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10579}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0483", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0483"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014116", :literature {"PUB00017603" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Preisig O" "Zufferey R" "Hennecke H."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
