{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Beta-2-microglobulin (Beta2m) constitutes the 12kDa light chain of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) on the surface of many cells, to which it is non-covalently associated. It is also found in the serum in a free form. Beta-2-microglobulin co-association with the MHC class I heavy chain is prerequisite for functional expression of the protein complex on the cell surface. Together these function in the presentation of nine amino acid peptides to the T-cell receptor of CD8-bearing T lymphocytes and killer inhibitory receptors on natural killer cells.</p>\n\n<p>Beta2m contains a β-sandwich domain composed of two facing β-sheets (four stranded and three stranded), that is typical of the C-type immunoglobulin superfamily. This structure is stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bridge connecting two Cys residues in the facing β-sheets [[cite:PUB00029693]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6vb2", "name" "HLA-B*15:02 complexed with a synthetic peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05770" "Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) beta-2-microglobulin; member of the C1-set of Ig superfamily (IgSF) domains"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-2-Microglobulin", "short" "B2Microglobulin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1648, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 150, "taxa" 671, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 392, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 282}, "pathways" 50}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015707", :literature {"PUB00029693" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Dam J" "Guan R" "Natarajan K" "Dimasi N" "Chlewicki LK" "Kranz DM" "Schuck P" "Margulies DH" "Mariuzza RA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
