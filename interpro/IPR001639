It delivers toxins and a range of hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-active enzymes to the cell surface or extracellular space [[cite:PUB00093998]]. T2SS systems are composed of 11 to 15 different proteins, which are generally called GspA to GspO and GspS. The T2SS spans the two bacterial membranes and ensures secretion of folded proteins across the outer membrane pore formed by GspD. The inner membrane complex contains GspC, GspL, GspM, and GspF. The cytoplasmic domains of GspL and GspF interact with an ATPase, GspE. GspE is thought to energize the formation of a short pseudopilus by several pilin-like proteins, GspG to GspK [[cite:PUB00094004]]. GspD has been shown to interact with the inner membrane component GspC [[cite:PUB00051842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2i6v", "name" "PDZ domain of EpsC from Vibrio cholerae, residues 219-305"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS01141" "Bacterial type II secretion system protein C signature"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01713" "type II secretion system protein GspC"}, "prints" {"PR00810" "BCTERIALGSPC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II secretion system protein GspC", "short" "T2SS_protein-GspC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 392, "taxa" 1907, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2095, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1519}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00878", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00878"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0053", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0053"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001639", :literature {"PUB00094002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lopez-Castilla A" "Vitorge B" "Khoury L" "Morellet N" "Francetic O" "Izadi-Pruneyre N."], "ISO_journal" "Biomol NMR Assign", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biomol NMR Assign", "title" "1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments and secondary structure of PulG, the major pseudopilin from Klebsiella oxytoca type 2 secretion system.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "155-158", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28258547}, "PUB00051842" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Korotkov KV" "Pardon E" "Steyaert J" "Hol WG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2008.11.011", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the secretin GspD from ETEC determined with the assistance of a nanobody.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "255-65", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19217396}, "PUB00093998" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Korotkov KV" "Sandkvist M."], "ISO_journal" "EcoSal Plus", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EcoSal Plus", "title" "Architecture, Function, and Substrates of the Type II Secretion System.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30767847}, "PUB00094004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Wang X" "Pineau C" "Gu S" "Guschinskaya N" "Pickersgill RW" "Shevchik VE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
