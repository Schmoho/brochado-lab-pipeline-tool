{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins found in bacteria and some archaeal species, including the Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer (ASRT) and the hypothetical protein TM1070 from Thermotoga maritima. ASRT, likely to bind sugars or related metabolites, is comprised of a single globular domain with an eight-stranded β-sandwich fold with a well conserved tryptophan at the start of the first strand and a nearly absolutely conserved asparagine located at the end of the second β-strand that is involved in stabilising the characteristic tight turn between strands 2 and 3 of the structure [[cite:PUB00100872], [cite:PUB00041719], [cite:PUB00100873]]. TM1070 has a β-sandwich structure with a jelly-roll fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2iia", "name" "Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036698", "name" "TM1070-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07100" "Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF008711" "Epothilone biosynthesis protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer", "short" "ASRT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 356, "taxa" 1730, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1277, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1271, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 954}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009794", :literature {"PUB00041719" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Vogeley L" "Trivedi VD" "Sineshchekov OA" "Spudich EN" "Spudich JL" "Luecke H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
