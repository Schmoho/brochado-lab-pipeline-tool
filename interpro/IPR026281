{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the HTH-type transcriptional regulator RamB (Rv0465c/MT0481) and PrpR. In Corynebacterium glutamicum RamB controls the expression of several genes involved in acetate metabolism [[cite:PUB00074928]]. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis RamB is involved in the control of the glyoxylate cycle [[cite:PUB00074927]] and its paralogue PrpR in the regulation of the methylcitrate pathway [[cite:PUB00074929]]. Family members contain a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, which is a major structural motif capable of binding DNA. Many proteins with this motif have been shown to regulate gene expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes RSP_2186 (also known as PccR) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. RSP_2186 is a transcriptional regulator that controls pccB expression, and consequently, PCC (propionyl-CoA carboxylase) activity [[cite:PUB00076849]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF019251" "HTH type transcriptional regulator Rv0465c/Mt0481"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HTH-type transcriptional regulator RamB", "short" "HTH_RamB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1710, "taxa" 5698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7521, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7388, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5975}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026281", :literature {"PUB00074929" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Masiewicz P" "Brzostek A" "Wolanski M" "Dziadek J" "Zakrzewska-Czerwinska J."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043651", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "A novel role of the PrpR as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of methylcitrate pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e43651", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22916289}, "PUB00074928" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Gerstmeir R" "Cramer A" "Dangel P" "Schaffer S" "Eikmanns BJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
