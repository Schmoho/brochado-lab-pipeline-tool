{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In plants, sucrose synthesis involves just two enzymes: sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) catalyses the synthesis of sucrose-6F-phosphate (Suc6P), which is then hydrolysed to sucrose by sucrose-phosphatase (SPP) [[cite:PUB00095433]]. This entry represents the sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) family. In Arabidopsis there are 4 SPS proteins, including AtSPSA1 (At5g20280), AtSPSA2 (At5g11110), AtSPSB (At1g04920) and AtSPSC (At4g10120). It has been shown that the four SPS proteins are functionally redundant in processes that are important for plant growth, vegetative and reproductive development, and nonstructural carbohydrate metabolism [[cite:PUB00085823], [cite:PUB00095431]]. This entry also includes bacterial sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2r60", "name" "Structure of apo Sucrose Phosphate Synthase (SPS) of Halothermothrix orenii"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46039" "SUCROSE-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 3-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sucrose-phosphate synthase", "short" "SPS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 763, "taxa" 3693, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4788, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4788, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3118}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
