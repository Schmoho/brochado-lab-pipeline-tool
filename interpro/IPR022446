{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family is closely related to two different families of protein-(glutamine-N5) methyltransferase. The first is PrmB, which modifies ribosomal protein L3 in some bacteria. The second is PrmC (HemK), which modifies peptide chain release factors 1 and 2 in most bacteria and also in eukaryotes. The glutamine side chain-binding motif NPPY shared by PrmB and PrmC is N[VAT]PY in this family. The protein substrate is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03704" "putative protein N(5)-glutamine methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N5-glutamine methyltransferase, putative", "short" "MeTrfrase_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1158, "taxa" 3215, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2853, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2152}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022446", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004556", "name" "Methyltransferase HemK-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017127", "name" "Ribosomal protein uL3 glutamine methyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR019874", "name" "Release factor glutamine methyltransferase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022446", "name" "N5-glutamine methyltransferase, putative", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR052663", "name" "Release factor glutamine methyltransferase, cyanobacteria-type", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
