{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Viral protein 3 (VP3) specifically binds to GTP and contains mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase activities. It is a multifunctional enzyme involved in mRNA capping. It catalyses the formation of the 5' cap structure on the viral plus-strand transcripts [[cite:PUB00012924], [cite:PUB00095809]]. Structure analyses revealed that it contains a variable N-terminal domain, a central guanine-N7-methyltransferase domain with an additional inserted domain, and a C-terminal guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase domain. The insertion in the guanine-N7-methyltransferase domain is a ribose-2'-O-methyltransferase domain for most rotavirus species [[cite:PUB00095808]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04128" "Protein VP3", "MF_04124" "Protein VP3"}, "profile" {"PS51589" "Viral protein 3 containing mRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF06929" "Rotavirus VP3 protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004015" "Predicted phosphoesterase, rotavirus type"}, "cdd" {"cd20757" "Cap-0 specific (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase of rotavirus"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein VP3, rotavirus", "short" "VP3_Rotav"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 12, "taxa" 363, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3796, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3794, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
