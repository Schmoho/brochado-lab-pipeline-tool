{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Carnosine N-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.22]), conserved from yeast to human, that catalyses the formation of anserine (beta-alanyl-N(Pi)-methyl-L-histidine) from carnosine. Anserine, a methylated derivative of carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine), is an abundant constituent of vertebrate skeletal muscles. It also methylates other L-histidine-containing di- and tripeptides such as Gly-Gly-His, Gly-His and homocarnosine (GABA-His) [[cite:PUB00098813], [cite:PUB00098814], [cite:PUB00098815]].</p>\n\n<p>Carnosine N-methyltransferase unmet from Drosophila melanogaster, acts as a sensor to signal methionine availability to the mTORC1 signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00158949]]. It associates with the GATOR2 complex in the absence of methionine to inhibit mTORC1 signalling, but dissociates in the presence of the methionine derivative S-adenosyl-L-methionine; S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine binding does not induce dissociation [[cite:PUB00158949]]. It is required for mTORC1 pathway response to methionine starvation [[cite:PUB00158949]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01296" "N2227"}, "pfam" {"PF07942" "Carnosine N-methyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR12303" "CARNOSINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carnosine N-methyltransferase", "short" "CARME"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 112, "proteomes" 2546, "taxa" 8829, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5819, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5797, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3819}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
