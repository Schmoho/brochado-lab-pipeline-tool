{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the FAM173 family, including N-lysine methyltransferase FAM173A and FAM173B. FAM173B is a lysine-specific methyltransferase (KMT) responsible for methylation of ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc), a key protein in cellular ATP production [[cite:PUB00092868]]. FAM173B, therefore, was renamed ATPSCKMT. It has been shown to promote chronic pain and is involved in persistent inflammatory and neuropathic pain via a pathway dependent on its methyltransferase activity [[cite:PUB00089647]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5fa8", "name" "SAM complex with aKMT from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus islandicu"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13610" "METHYLTRANSFERASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-lysine methyltransferase FAM173A/B", "short" "FAM173A/B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2131, "taxa" 10456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11382, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11382, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8365}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
