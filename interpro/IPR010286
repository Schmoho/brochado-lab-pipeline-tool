{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase F (RlmF), and related proteins, including methyltransferase-like protein 16 (METTL16). METTL16 is a conserved RNA methyltransferase which interacts specifically with the MALAT1 triple helix. METTL16 shows nuclear localisation [[cite:PUB00085149]]. Another functional study indicates that METTL16 regulates expression of human MAT2A, which encodes the SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. Furthermore, results indicate that METTL16 is the long-unknown methyltransferase for the U6 spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and it has evolved an additional function in vertebrates to control SAM homeostasis by post-transcriptionally regulating SAM synthetase gene expression [[cite:PUB00086421]].</p>\n\n<p>RlmF methylates the adenine in position 1618 of 23S rRNA [[cite:PUB00052324]]. This family also includes psilocybin synthase (PsiM), which is a methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the psychotropic agent psilocybin from the mushroom Psilocybe cubensis [[cite:PUB00086873]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2h00", "name" "Human methyltransferase 10 domain containing protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05971" "RNA methyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR13393" "SAM-DEPENDENT METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "METTL16/RlmF family", "short" "METTL16/RlmF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 88, "proteomes" 3476, "taxa" 13804, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10504, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10265, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7469}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
