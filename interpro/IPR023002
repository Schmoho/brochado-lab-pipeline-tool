{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents archaeal glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase [ec:1.1.1.261]. Glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase is responsible for the formation of the archaeal-specific glycerophosphate backbone of phospholipids, G-1-P, from glycerone phosphate [[cite:PUB00043531]],  using either NADH or NADPH as a coenzyme [[cite:PUB00081222]], and is primarily Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent in archaea [[cite:PUB00081219]]. This is the key step in the in biosynthesis of archaeal enantiomeric phospholipids [[cite:PUB00043532]].  One characteristic feature of archaea is that their cellular membrane has an ether linkage between the glycerol backbone and the hydrocarbon residues. The polar lipids of the members of Archaea consist of di- and tetraethers of glycerol with isoprenoid alcohols bound at the sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol moiety. The archaeal polar lipids have the enantiomeric configuration of a glycerophosphate backbone [sn- glycerol-1-phosphate (G-1-P)]. that is the mirror image structure of the bacterial or eukaryal counterpart [sn-glycerol- 3-phosphate (G-3-P)]. The absolute stereochemistry of the glycerol moiety in all archaeal polar lipids is opposite to that of glycerol ester lipids in bacteria and eukarya. This protein family is only found in Archaea [[cite:PUB00081220], [cite:PUB00081221]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00497_A" "Glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] [egsA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, archaea", "short" "G1P_dehydrogenase_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 277, "taxa" 1892, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1993, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1993, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1725}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
