ComGC, GD, GE and GG have N-terminal sequence motifs typical of type 4 pre-pilins and are processed by a pathway that requires the product of comC, also an essential competence gene. They form form pilin-like structures that are localised to the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall     [[cite:PUB00045993]]. The comG operon also consist of ComGF, a small integral membrane protein, ComGA and ComGB, which are predicted to be a nucleotide binding protein and an integral membrane protein respectively [[cite:PUB00067657]]. When strains missing each of the 7 proteins are created, they were all found to be nontransformable and failed to bind transforming DNA to the cell surface [[cite:PUB00045992]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF021292" "Competence protein, ComGD type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ComG operon protein 4", "short" "ComGD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 526, "taxa" 2186, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1796, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1794, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1375}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016785", :literature {"PUB00067657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Albano M" "Breitling R" "Dubnau DA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
