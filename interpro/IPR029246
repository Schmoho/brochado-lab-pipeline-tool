{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TALPID3 is the name of a classical chicken mutant with abnormal limb patterning and malformations in other regions of the embryo. It was so called because their paddle-shaped limbs resemble those of the mole (Talpa) [[cite:PUB00069928]]. Besides the limbs, there is a set of malformations including face, skeleton, and vascular defects [[cite:PUB00069928]]. TALPID3 gene was then identified and found to be a target for Hedgehog signalling [[cite:PUB00069934]]. In chickens, TALPID3 protein is a centrosomal protein required for the function of both Gli repressor and activator in the intracellular Hedgehog pathway [[cite:PUB00069928]]. Similar to the chicken TALPID3 mutants, the mouse mutants also lack primary cilia and have face and neural tube defects. Moreover, it has defects in left/right asymmetry [[cite:PUB00069937]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15324" "Hedgehog signalling target"}, "panther" {"PTHR15721" "KIAA0586 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein TALPID3", "short" "TALPID3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 655, "taxa" 2334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2043, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1520, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 458}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029246", :literature {"PUB00069934" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Ingham PW" "McMahon AP."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.938601", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Hedgehog signaling in animal development: paradigms and principles.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "3059-87", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11731473}, "PUB00069937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Bangs F" "Antonio N" "Thongnuek P" "Welten M" "Davey MG" "Briscoe J" "Tickle C."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.063602", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "Generation of mice with functional inactivation of talpid3, a gene first identified in chicken.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "3261-72", "volume" "138", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21750036}, "PUB00069928" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Davey MG" "Paton IR" "Yin Y" "Schmidt M" "Bangs FK" "Morrice DR" "Smith TG" "Buxton P" "Stamataki D" "Tanaka M" "Munsterberg AE" "Briscoe J" "Tickle C" "Burt DW."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.369106", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "The chicken talpid3 gene encodes a novel protein essential for Hedgehog signaling.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1365-77", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16702409}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007224", "name" "smoothened signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029246", "name" "Protein TALPID3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 1492}}}
