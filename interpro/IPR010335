{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian pre-pro-megakaryocyte potentiating factor precursor (MPF) or mesothelin proteins. Mesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein highly expressed in mesothelial cells, mesotheliomas, and ovarian cancer, which participates in cell adhesion, tumour progression, metastasis, and drug resistance [[cite:PUB00013403], [cite:PUB00013404], [cite:PUB00101012]]. This protein is predicted have superhelical structures with ARM-type repeats which suggests that it may act as superhelical lectins to bind the carbohydrate moieties of extracellular glycoproteins [[cite:PUB00061605]]. Due to its overexpression in various tumours, it constitutes a diagnostic and therapy target [[cite:PUB00101013]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06060" "Mesothelin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mesothelin", "short" "Mesothelin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 636, "taxa" 2155, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2456, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2191, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1319}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010335", :literature {"PUB00061605" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sathyanarayana BK" "Hahn Y" "Patankar MS" "Pastan I" "Lee B."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Struct.
