{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the beta subunit of geranylgeranyl transferase type-2 (GGTase-II), which is also known as Rab geranyl-geranyltransferase subunit beta, Bet2 and Ptb1.   GGTase-II catalyses the transfer of a geranyl-geranyl moiety from geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate to proteins having the C-terminal -XCC or -XCXC [[cite:PUB00061963], [cite:PUB00061964], [cite:PUB00061965]].  GGTase-IIs are a subgroup of protein prenyltransferases (PTases) of lipid-modifying enzymes. PTases catalyze the carboxyl-terminal lipidation of Ras, Rab, and several other cellular signal transduction proteins, facilitating membrane associations and specific protein-protein interactions. Prenyltransferases employ a Zn2+ ion to alkylate a thiol group catalyzing the formation of thioether linkages between cysteine residues at or near the C terminus of protein acceptors and the C1 atom of isoprenoid lipids (geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) in the case of GGTase-II). GGTase-II catalyzes alkylation of both cysteine residues in Rab proteins containing carboxy-terminal \"CC\", \"CXCX\" or \"CXC\" motifs. PTases are heterodimeric with both alpha and beta subunits required for catalytic activity. The beta subunit has an α6-α6 barrel fold. In contrast to other prenyltransferases, GGTas-II requires an escort protein to bring the substrate protein to the catalytic heterodimer and to escort the geryanylgeranylated product to the membrane [[cite:PUB00080791], [cite:PUB00080792]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gtv", "name" "Engineered RabGGTase in complex with BMS analogue 13"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008930", "name" "Terpenoid cyclases/protein prenyltransferase alpha-alpha toroid", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02894" "GGTase-II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Geranylgeranyl transferase type-2 subunit beta", "short" "Ptb1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2552, "taxa" 8717, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4442, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4441, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2906}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
