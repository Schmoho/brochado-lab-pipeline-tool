{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of examples of phosphonoacetate hydrolase, an enzyme specific for the cleavage of the C-P bond in phosphonoacetate. Phosphonates are organic compounds with a direct C-P bond that is far less labile than the C-O-P bonds of phosphate attachment sites. Phosphonates may be degraded for phosphorus and energy by broad spectrum C-P lyase encoded by a large operon or by specific enzymes for some of the more common phosphonates in nature. This family represents an enzyme from the latter category. It may be found encoded near genes for phosphonate transport and for other specific phosphonatases [[cite:PUB00015581]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3szy", "name" "Crystal Structure of Phosphonoacetate hydrolase from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 in APO form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02335" "phosphonoacetate hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonoacetate hydrolase", "short" "Phosphonoacetate_hydro"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 439, "taxa" 2016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2000, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2000, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1487}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0713", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0713"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
