{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (CLPTM1) and cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like protein (CLPTM1L, also known as CRR9). This entry also includes uncharacterised proteins from fungi and plants.</p>\n\n<p>Clefts of the lip and/or palate (CL/P) are some of the most common birth defects. They may be categorised into syndromic or non-syndromic types, with syndromic defects having an underlying chromosomal or teratogenic cause. Around 70% of clefts are non-syndromic and individuals have no typical physical or developmental abnormalities; these clefts generally show polygenetic behaviour and complex inheritance [[cite:PUB00053840]]. Studies have identified regions on chromosomes 19 and 11 which may be involved in non-syndromic cleft lip and palates; this included a novel gene on chromosome 19, cleft lip and palate-associated transmembrane protein 1 (CLPTM1) [[cite:PUB00011273]]. The Poliovirus receptor-related 1 gene (PVRL1), which is located on chromosome 11, has also been shown to associate with non-syndromic cleft lip and palates [[cite:PUB00053841], [cite:PUB00053842]].</p>\n\n<p>Human CLPTM1L is a scramblase that mediates the translocation glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol (alpha-D-GlcN-1-6-(1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-1D-myo-inositol, GlcN-PI) across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, from the cytosolic leaflet to the luminal leaflet of the ER membrane, where it participates in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) [[cite:PUB00101083]]. It protects non-small cell lung cancer tumour cells from genotoxic apoptosis and may contribute to lung cancer risk [[cite:PUB00072648], [cite:PUB00072649]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05602" "Cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (CLPTM1)"}, "panther" {"PTHR21347" "CLEFT LIP AND PALATE ASSOCIATED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cleft lip and palate transmembrane 1", "short" "CLPTM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 95, "proteomes" 2529, "taxa" 8777, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7853, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7364, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4809}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008429", :literature {"PUB00011273" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yoshiura K" "Machida J" "Daack-Hirsch S" "Patil SR" "Ashworth LK" "Hecht JT" "Murray JC."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.1998.5577", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "Characterization of a novel gene disrupted by a balanced chromosomal translocation t(2;19)(q11.2;q13.3) in a family with cleft lip and palate.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "231-40", "volume" "54", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9828125}, "PUB00072649" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["James MA" "Wen W" "Wang Y" "Byers LA" "Heymach JV" "Coombes KR" "Girard L" "Minna J" "You M."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036116", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Functional characterization of CLPTM1L as a lung cancer risk candidate gene in the 5p15.33 locus.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e36116", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22675468}, "PUB00072648" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["James MA" "Vikis HG" "Tate E" "Rymaszewski AL" "You M."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1617", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "CRR9/CLPTM1L regulates cell survival signaling and is required for Ras transformation and lung tumorigenesis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1116-27", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24366883}, "PUB00053840" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Turhani D" "Item CB" "Watzinger E" "Sinko K" "Watzinger F" "Lauer G" "Ewers R."], "ISO_journal" "J Craniomaxillofac Surg", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2005.04.004", "medline_journal" "J Craniomaxillofac Surg", "title" "Mutation analysis of CLPTM 1 and PVRL 1 genes in patients with non-syndromic clefts of lip, alveolus and palate.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "301-6", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16122939}, "PUB00053842" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sozen MA" "Hecht JT" "Spritz RA."], "ISO_journal" "Genet Test Mol Biomarkers", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/gtmb.2009.0052", "medline_journal" "Genet Test Mol Biomarkers", "title" "Mutation analysis of the PVRL1 gene in caucasians with nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "617-21", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19715471}, "PUB00053841" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sozen MA" "Suzuki K" "Tolarova MM" "Bustos T" "Fernandez Iglesias JE" "Spritz RA."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
