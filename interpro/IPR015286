{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MspA is a membrane porin produced by Mycobacteria, allowing hydrophilic nutrients to enter the bacterium. The protein forms a tightly interconnected octamer with eightfold rotation symmetry that resembles a goblet and contains a central channel. Each subunit fold contains a β-sandwich of Ig-like topology and a β-ribbon arm that forms an oligomeric transmembrane barrel [[cite:PUB00031908]]. The Mycobacterium smegmatis genome encodes four paralogues, MspA, MspB, MspC and MspD, which are also represented by this entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09203" "MspA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Porin family, mycobacterial-type", "short" "Porin_fam_mycobact-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 165, "taxa" 703, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2989, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2966, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2502}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015286", :literature {"PUB00031908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5661", "authors" ["Faller M" "Niederweis M" "Schulz GE."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1094114", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The structure of a mycobacterial outer-membrane channel.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1189-92", "volume" "303", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14976314}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015286", "name" "Porin family, mycobacterial-type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 32, "alignment:full" 801}}}
