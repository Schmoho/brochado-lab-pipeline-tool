{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MSL2 (MSL2; [ec:6.3.2.-]) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes monoubiquitination of histone H2B at 'Lys-35' (H2BK34Ub), but not that of H2A. It is a component of MSL complex, first identified in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00065184]]. MSL2 is a putative DNA-binding protein required for X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila males. Its expression is sex specifically regulated by Sex-lethal. Drosophila dosage compensation proteins MOF, MSL1, MSL2, and MSL3 are essential for elevating transcription of the single X chromosome in the male (X chromosome dosage compensation). MSL2 plays a critical role in translation and/or stability of MSL1 in males. In complex with MSL1, it acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes ubiquitination of histone H2B. MSL2 contains a C3HC4-type RING-HC finger and a metallothionein-like domain with eight conserved and two non-conserved cysteines, as well as a positively and a negatively charged amino acid residue cluster and a coiled coil domain that may be involved in protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00062204], [cite:PUB00135862], [cite:PUB00065184], [cite:PUB00135863], [cite:PUB00135864], [cite:PUB00135865]]</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is a histone acetyltransferase with specificity for histone H4 'lysine-16' in chromatin.
