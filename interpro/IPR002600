{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of various functionally undefined proteins from the herpesviridae and UL7 from Bovine herpesvirus 1 [[cite:PUB00003518], [cite:PUB00005609]]. UL7 is not essential for virus replication in cell culture, and is found localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells accumulated around the nucleus but could not be detected in purified virions [[cite:PUB00003518]]. Members of the herpesviridae have a dsDNA genome and do not have a RNA stage during there replication.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes cytoplasmic envelopment protein 1 (or UL103) which is important for the final step of tegumentation, envelope acquisition and egress of virus particles out of the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00082595], [cite:PUB00084208]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6lqn", "name" "EBV tegument protein BBRF2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04038" "Cytoplasmic envelopment protein 1"}, "pfam" {"PF01677" "Herpesvirus UL7 like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus UL7-like", "short" "Herpes_UL7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 341, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 341, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002600", :literature {"PUB00003518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Schmitt J" "Keil GM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
