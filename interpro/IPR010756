The human homologue, the splicing factor C9orf78 (also known as hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 59), plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing by promoting usage of the upstream 3'-splice site at alternative NAGNAG splice sites [[cite:PUB00101900]]. It may also modulate exon inclusion events and plays a role in spliceosomal remodeling by displacing WBP4 from SNRNP200 and may act to inhibit SNRNP200 helicase activity [[cite:PUB00101902], [cite:PUB00072803]].
