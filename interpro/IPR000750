{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Vertebrate endogenous opioid neuropeptides are released by post-translational proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins. The precursors consist of the following components: a signal sequence that precedes a conserved region of about 50 residues; a variable-length region; and the sequence of the neuropeptide itself. Three types of precursor are known: preproenkephalin A (gene PENK), which is processed to produce 6 copies of Met-enkephalin, plus Leu-enkephalin; preproenkephalin B (gene PDYN), which is processed to produce neoendorphin, dynorphin, leumorphin, rimorphin and Leu-enkephalin; and prepronocipeptin (gene PNOC), whose processing produces nociceptin (orphanin FQ) and two other potential neuropeptides.</p>\n\n<p>Sequence analysis reveals that the conserved N-terminal region of the precursors contains 6 cysteines, which are probably involved in disulphide bond formation. It is speculated that this region might be important for neuropeptide processing [[cite:PUB00004901]].</p>\n\n<p>The primary structure of Sus scrofa (Pig) preproenkephalin B has been elucidated and shown to contain neoendorphin, dynorphin and leumorphin (containing rimorphin as its N terminus). These opioid peptides, each having a Leu-enkephalin structure, act on the kappa-receptor. The sequence similarity observed between preproenkephalin B and preproenkephalin A, coupled with the similarity between their gene organisations, suggests that the two genes have been generated from a common ancestor by gene duplication [[cite:PUB00003982]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01030" "PENKBPRCRSR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proenkephalin B", "short" "Proenkphlin_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 460, "taxa" 1540, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2963, "sets" 0, "proteins" 609, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 448}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000750", :literature {"PUB00004901" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Mollereau C" "Simons MJ" "Soularue P" "Liners F" "Vassart G" "Meunier JC" "Parmentier M."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
