{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme is the enolase-phosphatase of methionine salvage, a pathway that regenerates methionine from methylthioadenosine (MTA). Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is a donor of different moieties for various processes, including methylation reactions. Use of AdoMet for spermidine biosynthesis, which leads to polyamine biosynthesis, leaves MTA as a by-product that must be cleared.
