{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents members of the family of Cas2, one of the first four protein families found to be associated with prokaryotic genomes containing multiple CRISPR elements. CRISPR systems protect against invasive nucleic acid sequences, including phage. Cas2 proteins have been characterised as either endoribonuclease (for ssRNA) or endodeoxyribonuclease (for dsDNA), depending on the system to which the Cas2 belongs [[cite:PUB00047685]]. The cas genes usually are found near the palindromic repeats. It's worth noting that there is a distinct branch of the Cas2 family [interpro:IPR010152] showing a very low level of sequence identity [[cite:PUB00020781], [cite:PUB00074066]].</p>\n<p>The structural subunit of Cas2, belongs to the VapD family of interferases. The interferase catalytic site is intact in the majority of the Cas2 proteins but is disrupted in some, and is not required for spacer acquisition [[cite:PUB00094353], [cite:PUB00094354]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic defence mechanism against foreign genetic elements.
