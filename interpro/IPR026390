{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry is characterised by inclusion of its members within a cassette of seven distinctive enzymes.  These include four genes homologous to the elements of the neuraminic (sialic) acid biosynthesis cluster (NeuABCD), an aminotransferase and a nucleotidyltransferase in addition to the epimerase/dehydratase.  Together it is very likely that these enzymes direct the biosynthesis of a nine-carbon sugar analogue to CMP-neuraminic acid. Family member LegB (BFO_1074) from Tannerella forsythia was shown to act on GDP-GlcNAc at the start of a legionaminic acid biosynthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00106820]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04180" "NAD-dependent 4,6-dehydratase LegB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD-dependent 4,6-dehydratase LegB-like", "short" "LegB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 446, "taxa" 2752, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1640, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1640, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026390", :literature {"PUB00106820" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Friedrich V" "Janesch B" "Windwarder M" "Maresch D" "Braun ML" "Megson ZA" "Vinogradov E" "Goneau MF" "Sharma A" "Altmann F" "Messner P" "Schoenhofen IC" "Schaffer C."], "ISO_journal" "Glycobiology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Glycobiology", "title" "Tannerella forsythia strains display different cell-surface nonulosonic acids: biosynthetic pathway characterization and first insight into biological implications.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "342-357", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27986835}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026390", "name" "NAD-dependent 4,6-dehydratase LegB-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
