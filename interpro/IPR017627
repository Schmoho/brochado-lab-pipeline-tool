This enzyme is involved in the anaerobic nitrogen utilization via the assimilation of allantoin. It catalyses the second step in the allantoin degradation pathway, the deamination of the allantoin producing S-ureidoglycolate and ammonia from S-ureidoglycine [[cite:PUB00078751], [cite:PUB00096858]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of UGlyAH from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtUGlyAH) has been studied. It contains two structurally similar β-barrel domains, called N and C (cupin) domains. AtUGlyAH binds a Mn ion through its C-terminal domain which acts as a molecular anchor to bind (S)-ureidoglycine. Its structure showed a bi-cupin fold with a conserved jelly roll-like β-barrel fold and an octameric functional unit. Several structural homologues of UGlyAH, including the Escherichia coli ortholog YlbA (also known as GlxB6), also exhibit similar features [[cite:PUB00096859]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011051", "name" "RmlC-like cupin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34571" "(S)-UREIDOGLYCINE AMINOHYDROLASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03214" "(S)-ureidoglycine aminohydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "(S)-ureidoglycine aminohydrolase", "short" "UGHY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1627, "taxa" 6457, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5579, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5578, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4319}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0687"} {"accession" "GenProp0686", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0686"} {"accession" "GenProp1416", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1416"} {"accession" "GenProp1326", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1326"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
