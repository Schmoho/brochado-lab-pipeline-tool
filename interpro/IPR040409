{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phytochelatins are well known as the heavy metal-detoxifying peptides in higher plants, eukaryotic algae, fungi, nematode and cyanobacteria. Phytochelatin synthase (PCS, also known as glutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase; [ec:2.3.2.15]) is involved in the synthesis of phytochelatins (PC) and homophytochelatins (hPC). This enzyme is required for detoxification of heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenate. The N-terminal region of phytochelatin synthase contains the active site, as well as four highly conserved cysteine residues that appear to play an important role in heavy-metal-induced phytochelatin catalysis. The C-terminal region is rich in cysteines, and may act as a metal sensor, whereby the Cys residues bind cadmium ions to bring them into closer proximity and transferring them to the activation site in the N-terminal catalytic domain [[cite:PUB00044775]]. The C-terminal region displays homology to the functional domains of metallothionein and metallochaperone.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6tjl", "name" "Mature primitive pytochelatin synthase Alr0975 from Nostoc species bound to glutathione"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038156", "name" "Phytochelatin synthase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33447" "GLUTATHIONE GAMMA-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phytochelatin synthase", "short" "PCS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 847, "taxa" 3913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3317, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2288}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
