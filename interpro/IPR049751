{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the TraI protein as found in Escherichia coli (including [swissprot:Q00192] and [swissprot:Q00191]) and related bacterial proteins. The initiation process of transfer DNA synthesis requires the interaction of at least three plasmid-specific components (TraH, I, and J) at the transfer origin resulting in the assembly of a specialised nucleoprotein complex - the relaxosome. The site- and strand-specific cleavage at the transfer origin is dependent on TraI and TraJ. Members of this family of conjugative relaxases are also known as MobA of type P mobilisation systems [[cite:PUB00152943], [cite:PUB00099032], [cite:PUB00104931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041893" "TraI/MobA(P) family conjugative relaxase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TraI/MobA conjugative relaxases", "short" "TraI/MobA_relaxases"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 160, "taxa" 1369, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1263, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1263, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1026}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049751", :literature {"PUB00099032" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Garcillan-Barcia MP" "Francia MV" "de la Cruz F."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Rev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEMS Microbiol Rev", "title" "The diversity of conjugative relaxases and its application in plasmid classification.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "657-87", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19396961}, "PUB00152943" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Ziegelin G" "Pansegrau W" "Strack B" "Balzer D" "Kroger M" "Kruft V" "Lanka E."], "ISO_journal" "DNA Seq", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3109/10425179109020786", "medline_journal" "DNA Seq", "title" "Nucleotide sequence and organization of genes flanking the transfer origin of promiscuous plasmid RP4.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "303-27", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1665997}, "PUB00104931" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sen D" "Yano H" "Suzuki H" "Krol JE" "Rogers L" "Brown CJ" "Top EM."], "ISO_journal" "Plasmid", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plasmid", "title" "Comparative genomics of pAKD4, the prototype IncP-1delta plasmid with a complete backbone.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "98-107", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20018208}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049751", "name" "TraI/MobA conjugative relaxases", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
