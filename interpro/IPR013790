{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins was first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans [[cite:PUB00097248], [cite:PUB00097246], [cite:PUB00097247]], Smad proteins that act as intracellular signal transducers and transcriptional modulators activated by TGF-beta and regulates the entry into a developmentally arrested larval state known as dauer, in response to non-favorable environmental conditions. Mammalian dwarfins are phosphorylated in response to TGF-beta and are implicated in control of cell growth [[cite:PUB00004902], [cite:PUB00097244]]. The dwarfin family also includes the Drosophila protein MAD that is required for the function of decapentaplegic (DPP) and may play a role in DPP signalling. Drosophila Mad binds to DNA and directly mediates activation of vestigial by Dpp [[cite:PUB00004255]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6tbz", "name" "Crystal structure of the MH1 domain of Smad5-Smad3 chimera construct bound to the GGCGC site"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036578", "name" "SMAD MH1 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13703" "SMAD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dwarfin", "short" "Dwarfin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 41, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1028, "taxa" 4254, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15352, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15352, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10015}, "pathways" 90}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013790", :literature {"PUB00004902" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Yingling JM" "Das P" "Savage C" "Zhang M" "Padgett RW" "Wang XF."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
