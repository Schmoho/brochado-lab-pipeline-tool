{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH,[ec:1.2.1.27]) catalyses the irreversible NAD+- and CoA-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of methylmalonate semialdehyde to propionyl-CoA. Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase has been characterised in both prokaryotes [[cite:PUB00002721], [cite:PUB00013470]] and eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00013471]], functioning as a mammalian tetramer and a bacterial homodimer. Although similar in monomeric molecular mass and enzymatic activity, the N-terminal sequence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not correspond with the N-terminal sequence predicted for rat liver. Sequence homology to a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases places MMSDH in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) superfamily making MMSDH's CoA requirement unique among known ALDHs. Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is closely related to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and class 1 and 2 aldehyde dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00013471]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07085" "Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and ALDH family members 6A1 and 6B2"}, "panther" {"PTHR43866" "MALONATE-SEMIALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01722" "CoA-acylating methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase", "short" "MeMal-semiAld_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7264, "taxa" 26733, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35545, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35521, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26192}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1071", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1071"} {"accession" "GenProp1286", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1286"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
