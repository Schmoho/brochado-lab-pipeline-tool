{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome cbb3 oxidases are found almost exclusively in Proteobacteria, and represent a distinctive class of proton-pumping respiratory haem-copper oxidases (HCO) that lack many of the key structural features that contribute to the reaction cycle of the intensely studied mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). Expression of cytochrome cbb3 oxidase allows human pathogens to colonise anoxic tissues and agronomically important diazotrophs to sustain nitrogen fixation [[cite:PUB00014947]].</p>\n\n<p>Genes encoding a cytochrome cbb3 oxidase were initially designated fixNOQP (ccoNOQP), the ccoNOQP operon is always found close to a second gene cluster, known as fixGHIS (ccoGHIS) whose expression is necessary for the assembly of a functional cbb3 oxidase. On the basis of their derived amino acid sequences each of the four proteins encoded by the ccoGHIS operon are thought to be membrane-bound. It has been suggested that they may function in concert as a multi-subunit complex, possibly playing a role in the uptake and metabolism of copper required for the assembly of the binuclear centre of cytochrome cbb3 oxidase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR41532" "FIXS PROTEIN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00847" "cytochrome oxidase maturation protein, cbb3-type"}, "pfam" {"PF03597" "Cytochrome oxidase maturation protein cbb3-type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome oxidase maturation protein cbb3-type", "short" "Cyt_oxidase_maturation_cbb3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 3091, "taxa" 11652, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9457}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0483", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0483"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004714", :literature {"PUB00014947" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Pitcher RS" "Watmough NJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
