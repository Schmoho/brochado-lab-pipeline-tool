{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Spc105 from budding yeasts and Spc7 from fission yeasts. Spc7 is a component of the NMS (Ndc80-MIND-Spc7) super complex which has a role in kinetochore function during late meiotic prophase and throughout the mitotic cell cycle [[cite:PUB00069742]]. Spc105 and Kre28 forms a kinetochore complex, which is required for kinetochore binding by a discrete subset of kMAPs (BIM1, BIK1 and SLK19) and motors (CIN8, KAR3) [[cite:PUB00069741]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28260" "SPINDLE POLE BODY COMPONENT SPC105"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spc105/Spc7", "short" "Spc105/Spc7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1128, "taxa" 3111, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1678, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1678, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 431}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033338", :literature {"PUB00069741" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Pagliuca C" "Draviam VM" "Marco E" "Sorger PK" "De Wulf P."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007640", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Roles for the conserved spc105p/kre28p complex in kinetochore-microtubule binding and the spindle assembly checkpoint.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e7640", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19893618}, "PUB00069742" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Jakopec V" "Topolski B" "Fleig U."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
