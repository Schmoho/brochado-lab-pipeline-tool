{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is found in SH (small hydrophobic) proteins present in Metapneumovirus such as the Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV), a paramyxovirus that has three membrane proteins (G, F, and SH). Among them, the SH protein is a small type II integral membrane protein. It is located in both the plasma membrane as well as within intracellular compartments. AMPV type C- SH protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and cell surface, and is transported through ER-Golgi secretory pathway. AMPV SH protein is modified by N-linked glycans and can be released into the extracellular environment. Furthermore, it has been shown that glycosylated AMPV SH proteins form homodimers through cysteine-mediated disulfide bonds [[cite:PUB00085270]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17512" "Metapneumovirus Small hydrophobic protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metapneumovirus small hydrophobic protein", "short" "Metap_SH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 14, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035250", :literature {"PUB00085270" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Deng Q" "Song M" "Demers A" "Weng Y" "Lu W" "Wang D" "Kaushik RS" "Yu Q" "Li F."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.05.013", "medline_journal" "Virus Res", "title" "Biochemical characterization of the small hydrophobic protein of avian metapneumovirus.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "297-301", "volume" "167", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22659296}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035250", "name" "Metapneumovirus small hydrophobic protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 1}}}
