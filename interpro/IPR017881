{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria the main nitrite reductase activity is contributed by the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase, which detoxifies the nitrite formed as the product of nitrate reduction. The NADH-nitrite reductase operon consists of 4 genes: nirB, nirD, nirC and cysG. The enzyme is formed by the two subunits nirB and nirD. NirC is a nitrite transporter and cysG is required for the synthesis of sirohaem, a cofactor of the nirB subunit [[cite:PUB00043673], [cite:PUB00043674]]. NirD displays some sequence similarities with the 2Fe-2S Rieske domain (see [prositedoc:PDOC00177]), but it does not contain the essential residues for the coordination of the iron sulphur [[cite:PUB00080966], [cite:PUB00043837]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entry includes the NirD subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4aiv", "name" "Crystal Structure of putative NADH-dependent nitrite reductase small subunit from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036922", "name" "Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulphur domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40562" "PTHR40562"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrite reductase (NADH) small subunit", "short" "NirD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1876, "taxa" 7617, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7465, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7465, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5882}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
