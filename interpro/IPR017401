{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunits 12A/B/C (also known as MYPT1/MYPT2/Mbs85) from animals. They are key regulators of protein phosphatase 1C (PPP1C). They modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain by myosin light chain kinase, which is essential for smooth muscle contraction [[cite:PUB00073531], [cite:PUB00073532]]. MYPT2 have similar features as MYPT1, such as: a specific interaction with the catalytic subunit of type 1 phosphatase, delta isoform (PP1cdelta); interaction of MYPT2 with the small heart-specific MP subunit; interaction of the C-terminal region of MYPT2 with the active form of RhoA; phosphorylation by Rho-kinase at an inhibitory site, Thr646 and thiophosphorylation at Thr646 inhibited activity of the MYPT2-PP1cdelta complex [[cite:PUB00073532]].  Mbs85 has been shown to regulate myosin phosphatase activity [[cite:PUB00060820]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038141" "Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunits 12A/B/C, vertebrate type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A/B/C", "short" "MYPT1/MYPT2/Mbs85"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 663, "taxa" 2451, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6380, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3833, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2228}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017401", :literature {"PUB00073531" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Qiao YN" "He WQ" "Chen CP" "Zhang CH" "Zhao W" "Wang P" "Zhang L" "Wu YZ" "Yang X" "Peng YJ" "Gao JM" "Kamm KE" "Stull JT" "Zhu MS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
