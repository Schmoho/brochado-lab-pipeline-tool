DidA does not disrupt assembly of the division machinery and instead binds the essential division protein FtsN to block cytokinesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041580" "DNA damage-induced SOS-independent cell division inhibitor A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA damage-induced SOS-independent cell division inhibitor A-like", "short" "DidA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 43, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048169", :literature {"PUB00151407" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Modell JW" "Kambara TK" "Perchuk BS" "Laub MT."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "A DNA damage-induced, SOS-independent checkpoint regulates cell division in Caulobacter crescentus.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e1001977", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25350732}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048169", "name" "DNA damage-induced SOS-independent cell division inhibitor A-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
