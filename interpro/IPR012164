{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA-directed RNA polymerases [ec:2.7.7.6] (also known as  DNA-dependent RNA polymerases) are responsible for the polymerisation of ribonucleotides into a sequence complementary to the template DNA. In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases transcribing different sets of genes. Most RNA polymerases are multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits. The core RNA polymerase complex consists of five subunits (two alpha, one beta, one beta-prime and one omega) and is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a \"crab claw\"-like structure with an internal channel running along the full length [[cite:PUB00033173]]. The key functional sites of the enzyme, as defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, are located on the inner wall of this channel.</p>\n\n<p>RNA synthesis follows after the attachment of RNA polymerase to a specific site, the promoter, on the template DNA strand.  The RNA synthesis process continues until a termination sequence is reached. The RNA product, which is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, is known as the primary transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic nuclei contain three distinct types of RNA polymerases that differ in the RNA they synthesise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RNA polymerase I: located in the nucleoli, synthesises precursors of most ribosomal RNAs.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase II: occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises mRNA precursors.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase III: also occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises the precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, the tRNAs, and a variety of other small nuclear and cytosolic RNAs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic cells are also known to contain separate mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA polymerases. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases, whose molecular masses vary in size from 500 to 700kDa, contain two non-identical large (>100kDa) subunits and an array of up to 12 different small (less than 50kDa) subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In archaebacteria, there is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the conserved small (~15kDa), zinc ribbon-containing, subunit which is found in archaeal and eukaryotic polymerases and forms part of the catalytic core of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00008731], [cite:PUB00029086], [cite:PUB00018563]].

Although originally suggested to be a subunit of the archaeal RNA polymerase (known as archaeal DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit M), it elutes separately from active polymerase in gel filtration experiments and acts, like TFIIs, as an induction factor for RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase [[cite:PUB00009536], [cite:PUB00078615], [cite:PUB00099581]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised sequences from virus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005586" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit, RpoM type"}, "panther" {"PTHR11239" "DNA-DIRECTED RNA POLYMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit/transcription factor S", "short" "Rpa12/Rpb9/Rpc10/TFS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 436, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2859, "taxa" 13118, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14546, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14529, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9509}, "pathways" 188}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012164", :literature {"PUB00033173" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhang G" "Campbell EA" "Minakhin L" "Richter C" "Severinov K" "Darst SA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81515-9", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase at 3.3 A resolution.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "811-24", "volume" "98", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10499798}, "PUB00018563" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5660", "authors" ["Bushnell DA" "Westover KD" "Davis RE" "Kornberg RD."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1090838", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structural basis of transcription: an RNA polymerase II-TFIIB cocrystal at 4.5 Angstroms.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "983-8", "volume" "303", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14963322}, "PUB00000061" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Helmann JD" "Chamberlin MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
