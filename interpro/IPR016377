{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of sucrose phosphorylases, including sucrose 6(F)-phosphate phosphorylase (Tthe_1921) from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, as well as glucosylglycerate phosphorylase. Tthe_1921 catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis of sucrose 6(F)-phosphate. It also acts on sucrose, D-fructose, alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and D-fructose 6-phosphate [[cite:PUB00077114]]. Glucosylglycerate phosphorylase (part of subfamily 18 of glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13_18) in CAZy) was previously thought to also function as a sucrose phosphorylase. However, subsequent studies have shown it to be a glucosylglycerate phosphorylase, and to have no activity on sucrose [[cite:PUB00087341]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6s9v", "name" "Crystal structure of sucrose 6F-phosphate phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacter thermosaccharolyticum"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017853", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003059" "Sucrose phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sucrose/Glucosylglycerate phosphorylase-related", "short" "Sucrose_GGa_phosphorylase-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1012, "taxa" 4924, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4970, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4955, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3744}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
