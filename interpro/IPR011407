{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH). This enzyme catalyses the reaction:<reaction> 10-formyltetrahydrofolate + H2O + NADP+ = tetrahydrofolate + CO2 + NADPH + H+</reaction>\r\nAs such it acts as an NADP-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00002683]]. It is composed of two catalytic domains (the N- and C-terminal domains), which are connected by a 100-amino acid residue linker (intermediate domain). The intermediate domain functions similarly to an acyl carrier protein by binding to 4'-phosphopantetheine [[cite:PUB00043304]]. FDH differs from other members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family in that it binds the 2'-phosphate group of NADP via a water-mediated contact with Gln600, which may contribute to the specificity of the enzyme for NADP over NAD [[cite:PUB00042095]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036489" "10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase", "short" "10_FTHF_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 585, "taxa" 2654, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2473, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2029, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1094}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
