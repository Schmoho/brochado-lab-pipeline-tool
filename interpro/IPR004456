{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (iPGAM), it is a metalloenzyme found particularly in archaea and some eubacteria. It is responsible for the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate [[cite:PUB00055097]]. It is distantly related to the iPGAM ([interpro:IPR005995]) characteristic of plants and many eubacteria. The common active site and metal-binding residues of the phosphatase domain are easily identified, but the putative phosphotransferase domain is highly diverged. These proteins are unrelated to the cofactor-dependent PGAM. Activity has been demonstrated for proteins from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) [[cite:PUB00014447], [cite:PUB00014397]], Pyrococcus furiosus [[cite:PUB00014397]], and Sulfolobus solfataricus [[cite:PUB00014464]]. These proteins were initially misidentified as phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042253", "name" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd16011" "uncharacterized subfamily of alkaline phosphatase, homologous to 2 3 bisphosphoglycerate independent phosphoglycerate mutase (iPGM) and bacterial phosphopentomutases"}, "panther" {"PTHR31209" "COFACTOR-INDEPENDENT PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE"}, "pfam" {"PF10143" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006392" "Cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, archaeal type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00306" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase", "short" "Pglycerate_mutase_ApgM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 1455, "taxa" 7862, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11474, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11396, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8595}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0691", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0691"} {"accession" "GenProp1599", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1599"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
