{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins were first identified in land plants. Plant LEA proteins have been found to accumulate to high levels during the last stage of seed formation (when a natural desiccation of the seed tissues takes place) and during periods of water deficit in vegetative organs. Later, LEA homologues have also been found in various species [[cite:PUB00088596], [cite:PUB00009713]]. They have been classified into several subgroups in Pfam and according to Bray and Dure [[cite:PUB00088595]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Dehydrin has been classified as part of the LEA family (D-11 from Dure, or group 2 from Bray) [[cite:PUB00088595]]. Dehydrins contribute to freezing stress tolerance in plants and it was suggested that this could be partly due to their protective effect on membranes [[cite:PUB00015239]].</p>\n\n<p>Dehydrins share a number of structural features. One of the most notable features is the presence, in their central region, of a continuous run of five to nine serines followed by a cluster of charged residues. Such a region has been found in all known dehydrins so far with the exception of pea dehydrins. A second conserved feature is the presence of two copies of a lysine-rich octapeptide; the first copy is located just after the cluster of charged residues that follows the poly-serine region and the second copy is found at the C-terminal extremity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33346" "DEHYDRIN XERO 2-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF00257" "Dehydrin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dehydrin", "short" "Dehydrin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 1254, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3563, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3301, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2357}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00285", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00285"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000167", :literature {"PUB00088595" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hundertmark M" "Hincha DK."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Genomics", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-118", "medline_journal" "BMC Genomics", "title" "LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins and their encoding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "118", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18318901}, "PUB00088596" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hand SC" "Menze MA" "Toner M" "Boswell L" "Moore D."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
