They are present in the membranes of organisms from the three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya [[cite:PUB00013957]]. There are two families of MS channels: large-conductance MS channels (MscL) and small-conductance MS channels (MscS or YGGB). The pressure threshold for MscS opening is 50% that of MscL [[cite:PUB00013956]]. The MscS family is much larger and more variable in size and sequence than the MscL family. Much of the diversity in MscS proteins occurs in the size of the transmembrane regions, which ranges from three to eleven transmembrane helices, although the three C-terminal helices are conserved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30221" "SMALL-CONDUCTANCE MECHANOSENSITIVE CHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mechanosensitive ion channel MscS, archaea/bacteria type", "short" "MscS_archaea/bacteria_type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5487, "taxa" 24823, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 55307, "sets" 0, "proteins" 55307, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42324}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045275", :literature {"PUB00013956" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5598", "authors" ["Bass RB" "Strop P" "Barclay M" "Rees DC."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1077945", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Crystal structure of Escherichia coli MscS, a voltage-modulated and mechanosensitive channel.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1582-7", "volume" "298", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12446901}, "PUB00013957" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pivetti CD" "Yen MR" "Miller S" "Busch W" "Tseng YH" "Booth IR" "Saier MH Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
