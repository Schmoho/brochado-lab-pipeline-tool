{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Escherichia coli FtsZ ([swissprot:P0A9A6]) assembles into a Z ring at midcell. Its assembly at polar sites is prevented by the min system. MinC [swissprot:P18196], a component of this system, is an inhibitor of FtsZ assembly that is positioned within the cell by interaction with the MinDE proteins. MinC is an oligomer, probably a dimer [[cite:PUB00008426]]. The C-terminal half of MinC is the most conserved and interacts with MinD.  The N-terminal half is thought to interact with FtsZ. MinC rapidly oscillates between the poles of the cell to destabilise FtsZ filaments that have formed before they mature into polar Z rings.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036145", "name" "Septum formation inhibitor MinC, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34108" "SEPTUM SITE-DETERMINING PROTEIN MINC"}, "hamap" {"MF_00267" "Probable septum site-determining protein MinC [minC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01222" "septum site-determining protein MinC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Septum formation inhibitor MinC", "short" "MinC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3560, "taxa" 15407, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14924, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14924, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11675}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0165", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0165"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013033", :literature {"PUB00008426" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Hu Z" "Lutkenhaus J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
