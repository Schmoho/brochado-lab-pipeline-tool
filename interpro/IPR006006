{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the glutamate synthase [NADPH] small chain (GltD) and closely related proteins from a number of gamma and alpha subdivision Proteobacteria, including the putative oxidoreductases AegA and ucaF from E.coli. Proteins in this entry have an N-terminal 4Fe-4S dicluster domain, and a C-terminal pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain. GltD catalyzes the conversion of L-glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate into two molecules of L-glutamate [[cite:PUB00094587]]. AegA and ucaF are involved in formate-dependent uric acid degradation under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions.The C-terminal domain of AegA contains NADPH-binding sites, which are essential for the urate-degrading activity [[cite:PUB00094569]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01318" "glutamate synthase, small subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamate synthase NADPH small chain-like", "short" "GltD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1728, "taxa" 7491, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9181, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7130}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1615", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1615"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
