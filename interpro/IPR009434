{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The imprinted GNAS cluster, located on chromosome 2 in mice and chromosome 20 in humans, contains transcripts that are maternally, paternally, and/or biallelically expressed. Neuroendocrine secretory protein 55 (NESP55) is encoded by an upstream exon of the GNAS1 gene, which is expressed exclusively from the maternal allele [[cite:PUB00074854]]. It is a neuroendocrine secretory granule protein originally identified by screening cDNA libraries from bovine chromaffin cells with antibody against secretogranin II [[cite:PUB00012358]]. It belongs to the granin family, whose members are involved in endocrine and neuronal secretory pathways [[cite:PUB00074855]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NESP55 has been shown to act as biomarkers for endocrine and neuroendocrine tumours and implicated in cell growth [[cite:PUB00074855]]. It has been linked to pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP-1b), an imprinted human disorder associated with methylation changes at one or several differentially methylated regions at the GNAS locus [[cite:PUB00074856]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06390" "Neuroendocrine-specific golgi protein P55 (NESP55)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuroendocrine secretory protein 55", "short" "NESP55"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 109, "taxa" 400, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 98}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009434", :literature {"PUB00012358" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Fischer-Colbrie R" "Eder S" "Lovisetti-Scamihorn P" "Becker A" "Laslop A."], "ISO_journal" "Ann.
