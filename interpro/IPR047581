{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents sugar isomerases comprising group I of D-lyxose isomerases homologous to pathogenic Escherichia coli O157 z5688 (EcSI or Z5688) which has an active site highly similar to YdaE from the sigma B regulon of Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00103833]]. Substrate screening has revealed that EcSI is capable of acting on D-lyxose (E.C:[ec:5.3.1.15]) and D-mannose (EC:[ec:5.3.1.7]). Studies show that overexpression of EcSI enables cell growth on D-lyxose as the sole carbon source. Proteins in this family belong to the cupin superfamily with a conserved 'jelly roll-like' double-stranded Î²-helix fold [[cite:PUB00055252], [cite:PUB00016787], [cite:PUB00103823]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3kmh", "name" "Crystal Structure of a Novel Sugar Isomerase from E. coli O157:H7"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014710", "name" "RmlC-like jelly roll fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20309" "Escherichia coli sugar isomerase (EcSI), cupin domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-lyxose isomerase EcSI-like", "short" "EcSI_cupin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 537, "taxa" 2664, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2439, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2439, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1839}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
