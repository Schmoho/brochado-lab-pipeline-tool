{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the stage II sporulation protein E (SpoIIE, [ec:3.1.3.16]), which is a multiple membrane spanning protein with two separable functions. It plays a role in the switch to polar cell division during sporulation and it has phosphatase activity, located in the C-terminal region, which is required to activate sigma-F by dephosphorylating the phosphoprotein SpoIIAA-P [[cite:PUB00098969]]. All members of this entry are found in endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. A homologous protein, not a member of this entry, is found in the Cyanobacterium-like (and presumably non-spore-forming) photosynthesizer Heliobacillus mobilis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02865" "stage II sporulation protein E"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stage II sporulation protein E", "short" "SpoII_E"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 767, "taxa" 2197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2003, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2003, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1517}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
