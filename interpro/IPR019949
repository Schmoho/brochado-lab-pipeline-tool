{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of prokaryotic alkanal monooxygenase, including Luciferase-like monooxygenase from Escherichia coli (YhbW) and N-acetyl-S-alkylcysteine monooxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (CmoO). CmoO is involved in a cysteine salvage pathway from S-alkylcysteine, which is likely important in the catabolism of alkylated cysteine generated by proteolysis of alkylated glutathione formed in the detoxification of a wide range of electrophiles [[cite:PUB00103904]]. This protein family represents a well-resolved clade within [interpro:IPR011251] and shows no restriction to coenzyme F420-positive species, unlike some other clades within this larger group of proteins [[cite:PUB00106750]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4us5", "name" "Crystal Structure of apo-MsnO8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03558" "MsnO8 family LLM class oxidoreductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetyl-S-alkylcysteine monooxygenase-like", "short" "CmoO-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5224, "taxa" 18542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26480, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26468, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20527}, "pathways" 106}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
