{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of human whooping cough (pertussis), is an obligate human pathogen with diverse high-affinity transport systems for the assimilation of iron, a biometal that is essential for growth [[cite:PUB00043632]]. Periplasmic binding proteins of a new family, particularly well represented in this organism (and more generally in beta-proteobacteria), have been called Bug receptors [[cite:PUB00040549]].</p>\n\n<p>They adopt a characteristic Venus flytrap fold with two globular domains bisected by a ligand-binding cleft. The family is specific for carboxylated solutes, with a characteristic mode of binding involving two highly conserved β strand-β turn-α helix motifs originating from each domain. These two motifs form hydrogen bonds with a carboxylate group of the ligand, both directly and via conserved water molecules, and have thus been termed the carboxylate pincers. Domain 1 recognises the ligand and the carboxylate group serves as an initial anchoring point. Domain 2 discriminates between productively and non-productively bound ligands as proper interactions with this domain is needed for the of the closed conformation [[cite:PUB00043633]].</p>\n\n<p>BugE has a glutamate bound ligand. No charged residues are involved in glutamate binding by BugE, unlike what has been described for all glutamate receptors reported so far. The Bug architecture is highly conserved despite limited sequence identity [[cite:PUB00040326]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2f5x", "name" "Structure of periplasmic binding protein BugD"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042100", "name" "Bordetella uptake gene, domain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42928" "TRICARBOXYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017082" "Protein YflP"}, "pfam" {"PF03401" "Tripartite tricarboxylate transporter family receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bordetella uptake gene", "short" "BUG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 148, "proteomes" 3232, "taxa" 13189, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 125856, "sets" 0, "proteins" 125686, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 97091}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005064", :literature {"PUB00043632" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Brickman TJ" "Armstrong SK."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
