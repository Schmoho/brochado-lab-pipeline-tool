{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (MCADs) are mitochondrial beta-oxidation enzymes, which catalyse the alpha,beta dehydrogenation of the corresponding medium chain acyl-CoA by FAD, which becomes reduced [[cite:PUB00102119], [cite:PUB00102120]]. The reduced form of MCAD is reoxidized in the oxidative half-reaction by electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF), from which the electrons are transferred to the mitochondrial respiratory chain coupled with ATP synthesis. MCAD is a homotetramer [[cite:PUB00082821], [cite:PUB00007933]]. This protein contribute to PINK1-mediated regulation of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, through a mechanism that is independent of its acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Mutations in PINK1 are associated with Parkinson's disease [[cite:PUB00102119]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4p13", "name" "Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, K304E mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009100", "name" "Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase/oxidase, N-terminal and middle domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01157" "Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase", "short" "MCAD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 445, "taxa" 1808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 912, "sets" 0, "proteins" 912, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 602}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
