{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many bacteria are covered in a layer of surface-associated polysaccharide called the capsule. These capsules can be divided into four groups depending upon the organisation of genes responsible for capsule assembly, the assembly pathway and regulation [[cite:PUB00062058]]. This family plays a role in group 1 capsule biosynthesis. It is likely to be involved in the later stages of capsule assembly.</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, Wzi consists of an 18-stranded Î²-barrel with a periplasmic helical bundle that has a role in the recognition of the capsular polysaccharide. It is predicted that the Wzi-polysaccharide interaction is critical in the initialisation step of the functional capsule biosynthesis and the later steps of the capsule assembly  [[cite:PUB00062059], [cite:PUB00097454]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038636", "name" "Capsule assembly protein Wzi superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14052" "Capsule assembly protein Wzi"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Capsule assembly protein Wzi", "short" "Caps_assemb_Wzi"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 767, "taxa" 3912, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5782, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5735, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4433}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026950", :literature {"PUB00062059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Rahn A" "Beis K" "Naismith JH" "Whitfield C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
