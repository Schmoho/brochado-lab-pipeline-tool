{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are acidic surface proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide and a variant C-terminal sortase recognition sequence, LPXTA rather than LPXTG. The N-terminal region past the signal peptide is repeated a second or third time in many members of this family. Members occur in Firmicutes, encoded next to a dedicated sortase related to SrtC that assembles pilins, suggesting that this protein serves a structural rather than enzymatic role. Processing by the neighbouring sortase may result in polymerisation as well as surface attachment.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04383" "processed acidic surface protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Processed acidic surface protein", "short" "Acidic_LPXTA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 124, "taxa" 401, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 327}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030832", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030832", "name" "Processed acidic surface protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
