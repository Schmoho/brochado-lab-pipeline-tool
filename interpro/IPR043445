It is a type I transmembrane protein that has an N-erminal extracellular and a single transmembrane domains. TMEPAI contains two PY motifs that can be targetedby the WW domain. It is involved in a negative feedback loop to control the duration and intensity of TGF-beta signaling, which regulates growth suppression, apoptosis induction, extracellular matrix production, and differentiation [[cite:PUB00088947]]. It is also involved in androgen receptor signalling, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 signalling, and formation of autophagosomes in addition to degradation of TbetaRI (TGF-beta type I receptor) through lysosomes [[cite:PUB00094032]].
