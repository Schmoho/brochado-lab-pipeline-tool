{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of proteins found in eukaryotes that consists of proline-rich 15 (PRR15) and proline-rich 15-like proteins. PRR15 is expressed almost exclusively in post-mitotic cells both during foetal development and in adult tissues, such as the intestinal epithelium and the testis. Its expression in mouse and human gastrointestinal tumours is linked, directly or indirectly, to the disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00067728]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14581" "PTHR14581"}, "pfam" {"PF15321" "ATPase family AAA domain containing 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proline-rich protein 15", "short" "PRR15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 595, "taxa" 2094, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1410, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1409, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 984}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028237", :literature {"PUB00067728" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Meunier D" "Patra K" "Smits R" "Hagebarth A" "Luttges A" "Jaussi R" "Wieduwilt MJ" "Quintanilla-Fend L" "Himmelbauer H" "Fodde R" "Fundele RH."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
