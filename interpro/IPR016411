{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSB, also known as helix-destabilising proteins and gp2.5) from bacteriophage T7. It is expressed in the late stage of lytic development, binding preferentially to single-stranded DNA and is implicated in DNA replication, formation of concatemers, recombination and repair of double-stranded breaks [[cite:PUB00097252], [cite:PUB00100563], [cite:PUB00100562], [cite:PUB00100561], [cite:PUB00042899]]. Together with DNA primase/helicase, promotes pairing of two homologous DNA molecules containing complementary single-stranded regions and mediates homologous DNA strand exchange [[cite:PUB00100563]]. SSB disrupts loops, hairpins and other secondary structures present on ssDNA to reduce and eliminate pausing of viral DNA polymerase at specific sites during elongation [[cite:PUB00042899]]. The C-terminal aromatic Phe and the overall acidic charge of this region are critical for its function [[cite:PUB00097252]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1je5", "name" "Crystal Structure of gp2.5, a Single-Stranded DNA Binding Protein Encoded by Bacteriophage T7"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04153" "Single-stranded DNA-binding protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004311" "Helix-destabilizing protein, bacteriophage T7 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Single-stranded DNA-binding protein, bacteriophage T7", "short" "SSB_T7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 137, "taxa" 815, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 584, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016411", :literature {"PUB00042899" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Kim YT" "Tabor S" "Bortner C" "Griffith JD" "Richardson CC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
