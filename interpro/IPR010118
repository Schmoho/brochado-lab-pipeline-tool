{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This clade of sequences is more closely related to TrpE (anthranilate synthase, [interpro:IPR005256], [interpro:IPR010116], [interpro:IPR005257]) than to the better characterised group of PabB enzymes ([interpro:IPR005802], [interpro:IPR010117]).  This clade includes one characterised enzyme from Lactococcus [[cite:PUB00013800]] and the conserved function across the clade is supported by these pieces of evidence: 1) all genomes with a member in this clade also have a separate TrpE gene, 2) none of these genomes contain an apparent PabB from any of the other PabB clades, 3) none of these sequences are found in a region of the genome in association with other Trp biosynthesis genes, 4) all of these genomes apparently contain most if not all of the steps of the folate biosynthetic pathway (for which PABA is a precursor). Many of the sequences are annotated as TrpE enzymes, however, we believe that all members of this clade are, in fact, PabB. The sequences from Bacillus halodurans and Bacillus subtilis, are also likely to be PabB enzymes, but are too closely related to TrpE to be separated at this time.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR005801", "name" "ADC synthase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01824" "aminodeoxychorismate synthase, component I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Para-aminobenzoate synthase/anthranilate synthase, component I", "short" "Para-NH2Bz/anthranilate_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 275, "taxa" 1556, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1156, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1156, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 841}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0759", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0759"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
