{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents human 40S small subunit processome assembly factor 1 (FSAF1), its homologue from Schizosaccharomyces pombe C3F10.08c, and similar proteins mainly found in animals. FSAF1 is part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, the first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome [[cite:PUB00151110]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15375" "Domain of unknown function (DUF4602)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "40S small subunit processome assembly factor 1-like", "short" "FSAF1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 44, "proteomes" 1588, "taxa" 5962, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2713, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2710, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1725}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027973", :literature {"PUB00151110" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6560", "authors" ["Singh S" "Vanden Broeck A" "Miller L" "Chaker-Margot M" "Klinge S."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Nucleolar maturation of the human small subunit processome.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "eabj5338", "volume" "373", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34516797}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027973", "name" "40S small subunit processome assembly factor 1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 39, "alignment:full" 1508}}}
