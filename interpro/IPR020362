{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The tail complex in bacteriophage P22, and related phages, mediates host cell attachment and DNA injection. Tail assembly is a complex event that is essential for the retention and stabilisation of the newly packaged DNA within the capsid. This process involves the sequential addition of three tail accessory factors (GP4, GP10, GP26) and the adhesion tailspike protein (GP9) to the capsid-bound portal protein [[cite:PUB00056238]].</p>\n\n<p>Gp4 is the first factor to attach after DNA packaging. Twelve monomeric subunits of GP4 bind to the exposed surface of the portal ring, beginning the tail assembly process. GP4 does not physically block the DNA entry/exit channel, but appears to act as a structural adaptor for the other tail accessory factors GP10 and GP26 [[cite:PUB00056239]].</p>\n\n<p>Gp4 has been shown to have peptidoglycan hydrolase activity [[cite:PUB00088229]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vgt", "name" "X-ray structure of bacteriophage Sf6 tail adaptor protein gp7"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038258", "name" "Peptidoglycan hydrolase Gp4 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11650" "P22 tail accessory factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tail accessory factor GP4", "short" "Tail_accessory_Gp4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 88, "taxa" 668, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 673, "sets" 0, "proteins" 673, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 443}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020362", :literature {"PUB00056238" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Casjens SR" "Thuman-Commike PA."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.12.046", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Evolution of mosaically related tailed bacteriophage genomes seen through the lens of phage P22 virion assembly.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "393-415", "volume" "411", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21310457}, "PUB00056239" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Olia AS" "Al-Bassam J" "Winn-Stapley DA" "Joss L" "Casjens SR" "Cingolani G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
