{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents non-receptor PTPase type 13 (also known as PTPL1, FAP-1 and PTP-BL). Studies indicate that this PTPase is involved in multiple regulatory functions including: negative regulation of FAS-induced apoptosis and NGFR-mediated pro-apoptotic signalling, regulation of the phophorylation status of ephrinB receptors in neurons, regulation of cytokinesis in epithelial cells, and the regulation of negative proliferation signals in breast cancer cells [[cite:PUB00033254], [cite:PUB00033255], [cite:PUB00033256], [cite:PUB00033257]]. This protein has been shown to interact with a wide variety of partners, an ability conferred by the presence of five distinct PDZ domains, and is thus suggested to function as an integrator between different signalling pathways. Multiple isoforms of this protein are formed by alternative splicing, which can dramatically affect its protein binding characteristics [[cite:PUB00033258]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000933" "Non-receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase, type 13"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 13", "short" "PTPN13"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 290, "taxa" 1179, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3522, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1334, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
