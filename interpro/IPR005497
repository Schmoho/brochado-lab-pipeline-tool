{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PetN is a small hydrophobic protein, crucial for cytochrome b6-f complex assembly and/or stability. It is found in bacteria and plants. Cytochrome b6-f complex is composed of 4 large subunits: cytochrome b6, subunit IV (17kDa polypeptide, petD), cytochrome f and the Rieske protein, as well as 4 small subunits: petG, petL, petM and petN. The complex functions as a dimer. The cytochrome b6-f complex mediates electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) [[cite:PUB00032072]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9es7", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of Spinacia oleracea cytochrome b6f complex with water molecules at 1.94 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036143", "name" "Cytochrome b6-f complex, subunit 8 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00395" "Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 8 [petN]"}, "pfam" {"PF03742" "PetN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b6-f complex, subunit 8", "short" "Cytochrome_b6-f_cplx_su8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 252, "taxa" 21478, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14896, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14895, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11911}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1353", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1353"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005497", :literature {"PUB00032072" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5647", "authors" ["Kurisu G" "Zhang H" "Smith JL" "Cramer WA."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1090165", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structure of the cytochrome b6f complex of oxygenic photosynthesis: tuning the cavity.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1009-14", "volume" "302", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14526088}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0045158", "name" "electron transporter, transferring electrons within cytochrome b6/f complex of photosystem II activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0017004", "name" "cytochrome complex assembly", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009512", "name" "cytochrome b6f complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005497", "name" "Cytochrome b6-f complex, subunit 8", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 13, "alignment:full" 282}}}
