{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes Cytochrome c-type proteins from proteobacteria, such as Cytochrome c-type protein SHP from Rhodobacter sphaeroides ([swissprot:P81238]), a high-spin cytochrome able to transiently bind oxygen during autoxidation. It is organized into a series of four Î±-helices and extended loop configuration, showing structural similarity to the class I cytochromes c. It has been suggested that SHP could reduce a small ligand, but its function is still unknown [[cite:PUB00024334]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1dw0", "name" "STRUCTURE OF OXIDIZED SHP, AN OXYGEN BINDING CYTOCHROME C"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09086" "Domain of unknown function (DUF1924)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1924, Cytochrome c-type protein SHP-like", "short" "DUF1924_SHP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 291, "taxa" 1474, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1329, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1328, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 952}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015170", :literature {"PUB00024334" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Leys D" "Backers K" "Meyer TE" "Hagen WR" "Cusanovich MA" "Van Beeumen JJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
