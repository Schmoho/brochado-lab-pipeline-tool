{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit MP18 from the RNA editing complex found in Trypanosoma and Leishmania. The editing process is performed by the editosome, a multi-protein complex that catalyses the insertion and deletion of uridylates (U) that occurs during RNA editing. Uridylate insertion/deletion editing, which appears to be unique to these organisms, processes most mitochondrial pre-mRNAs to produce mature mRNAs. Editosomes consist of several components and in Trypanosoma these include: REL1/MP52 and REL2/Mp48 RNA ligases; MP18, MP42, MP63 and MP81 that contain zinc fingers [[cite:PUB00042707]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037000" "RNA editing complex, subunit MP18"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA editing complex, subunit MP18", "short" "RNA_edit_cplx_su_MP18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 64, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017084", :literature {"PUB00042707" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Panigrahi AK" "Schnaufer A" "Ernst NL" "Wang B" "Carmean N" "Salavati R" "Stuart K."], "ISO_journal" "RNA", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1261/rna.2194603", "medline_journal" "RNA", "title" "Identification of novel components of Trypanosoma brucei editosomes.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "484-92", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12649499}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000424", "name" "Primosome PriB/single-strand DNA-binding", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011344", "name" "Single-stranded DNA-binding protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017084", "name" "RNA editing complex, subunit MP18", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023646", "name" "Primosomal replication protein PriB", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
