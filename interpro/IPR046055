{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). This BGC (BGC0001120) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic classes, NRP (non-ribosomal peptide) and polyketide. This family includes a protein from the burkholderic acid biosynthetic gene cluster from Burkholderia thailandensis E264 and appears to be predominantly found in Burkholderiaceae [[cite:PUB00099376], [cite:PUB00099398]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19476" "Family of unknown function (DUF6013)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6013", "short" "DUF6013"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 61, "taxa" 267, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 298, "sets" 0, "proteins" 298, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 239}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046055", :literature {"PUB00099376" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Franke J" "Ishida K" "Hertweck C."], "ISO_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "title" "Genomics-driven discovery of burkholderic acid, a noncanonical, cryptic polyketide from human pathogenic Burkholderia species.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "11611-5", "volume" "51", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23055407}, "PUB00099398" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Biggins JB" "Ternei MA" "Brady SF."], "ISO_journal" "J Am Chem Soc", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Am Chem Soc", "title" "Malleilactone, a polyketide synthase-derived virulence factor encoded by the cryptic secondary metabolome of Burkholderia pseudomallei group pathogens.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "13192-5", "volume" "134", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22765305}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046055", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6013", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 19, "alignment:full" 54}}}
