{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of phosphatidyltransferases, which are all involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and that share the property of catalysing the displacement of CMP from a CDP-alcohol by a second alcohol with formation of a phosphodiester bond and concomitant breaking of a phosphoride anhydride bond share a conserved sequence region [[cite:PUB00002448], [cite:PUB00002684]]. These enzymes are proteins of 200 to 400 amino acid residues, including EPT1 from yeast, CDP-diacylglycerol--glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferases from bacteria, CDP-diacylglycerol--serine O-phosphatidyltransferase from animals, among others. Also included in this entry is cardiolipin (CL) synthase (CMP-forming)/mitochondrial hydrolase fusion protein from S.pombe, a tandem fusion protein with a mitochondrial hydrolase. The CL synthase is essential for this organism [[cite:PUB00151491]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7b1l", "name" "Crystal structure of phosphatidyl serine synthase (PSS) in the closed conformation with bound citrate."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043130", "name" "CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase, transmembrane domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01066" "CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase", "short" "CDP-OH_P_trans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 508, "proteomes" 12208, "taxa" 47091, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 142542, "sets" 0, "proteins" 142238, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 106325}, "pathways" 69}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00321", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00321"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1758", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1758"} {"accession" "GenProp1548", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1548"} {"accession" "GenProp1252", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1252"} {"accession" "GenProp0724", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0724"} {"accession" "GenProp1351", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1351"} {"accession" "GenProp1627", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1627"} {"accession" "GenProp1352", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1352"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
