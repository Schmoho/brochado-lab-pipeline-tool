{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the oxygenase subunit of nitric oxide synthase ([ec:1.14.13.39]), which is the enzyme's catalytic centre responsible for the production of nitric oxide [[cite:PUB00044683], [cite:PUB00059206]]. This enzyme uses haem as a cofactor, as well as either tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B). It can also use tetrahydrofolate (THF) in place of H4B but binds THF with much lower affinity than H4B. This protein is similar to the oxygenase domain of eukaryotic nitric oxide synthases but lacks the reductase domain which, in eukaryotes, is responsible for transfer of electrons to the ferric haem during nitric oxide synthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4d7j", "name" "Structure of Bacillus subtilis nitric oxide synthase in complex with 6-(4-(((3-Fluorophenethyl)amino)methyl)phenyl)-4-methylpyridin-2- amine"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036119", "name" "Nitric oxide synthase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR044943", "name" "Nitric oxide synthase, domain 1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037219" "Nitric oxide synthase, oxygenase subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitric oxide synthase, oxygenase subunit", "short" "Nitric_oxide_synthase_Oase-su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 148, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 635, "taxa" 2267, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2006, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2006, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1478}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
