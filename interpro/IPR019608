{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems (I and II) located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae. Photosystem II (PSII) has a P680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll 'a' that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation (splitting) of water molecules, and to produce ATP via a proton pump. Photosystem I (PSI) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated hydrogen donated from PSII to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by PSII, releasing oxygen as a by-product [[cite:PUB00152828]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The photosynthetic reaction centres (RCs) of aerotolerant organisms contain a heterodimeric core, built up of two strongly homologous polypeptides each of which contributes five transmembrane peptide helices to hold a pseudo-symmetric double set of redox components.
