{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the small ribosomal subunit protein mS45, also known as Ribosomal protein S35, which localises to the mitochondria in live cells and co-fractionates with purified mitochondrial ribosomes. This group of proteins have a  function in the control of cell respiration by acting on the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery and a role in mitochondrial integrity. Observations also indicate that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast), alterations of mitochondrial function are linked to changes in cell cycle and cell morphology control mechanisms [[cite:PUB00053299]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28158" "37S RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S35, MITOCHONDRIAL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein mS45", "short" "Ribosomal_mS45"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1136, "taxa" 3042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1616, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1616, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1012}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021036", :literature {"PUB00053299" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wiley DJ" "Catanuto P" "Fontanesi F" "Rios C" "Sanchez N" "Barrientos A" "Verde F."], "ISO_journal" "Eukaryotic Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.00048-07", "medline_journal" "Eukaryot Cell", "title" "Bot1p is required for mitochondrial translation, respiratory function, and normal cell morphology in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "619-29", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18245278}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021036", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein mS45", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
