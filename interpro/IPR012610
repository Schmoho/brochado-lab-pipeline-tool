{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) of the H type (sspH). SspH are unique to spores of Bacillus subtilis and are expressed only in the forespore compartment during sporulation of this organism. The sspH genes are monocistronic and are recognised by the forespore-specific sigma factor for RNA polymerase - sigma-G. The specific role of this protein is unclear but is thought to play a role in sporulation under conditions different from that of the common laboratory tests of spore properties [[cite:PUB00016477]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00667" "Small, acid-soluble spore protein H [sspH]"}, "pfam" {"PF08141" "Small acid-soluble spore protein H family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02861" "H-type small acid-soluble spore protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small acid-soluble spore protein, SspH", "short" "SASP_SspH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 555, "taxa" 1691, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2282, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2282, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1760}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012610", :literature {"PUB00016477" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cabrera-Hernandez A" "Sanchez-Salas JL" "Paidhungat M" "Setlow P."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(99)00124-9", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Regulation of four genes encoding small, acid-soluble spore proteins in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1-10", "volume" "232", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10333516}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030436", "name" "asexual sporulation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0042601", "name" "endospore-forming forespore", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012610", "name" "Small acid-soluble spore protein, SspH", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 41, "alignment:full" 852}}}
