{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT; [ec:2.1.1.2]) catalyses the last step of creatine biosynthesis. In humans, GAMT is believed to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolic conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocycteine (SAH). GAMT is found in abundance in the liver of all vertebrates. The crystal structure of a truncated version of GAMT shows that it exists as a dimer [[cite:PUB00035937]], and the structure can be viewed as a ternary complex between protein arginine methyltransferase (one subunit) complexed with a protein substrate (the partner subunit) and the product SAH [[cite:PUB00028831]]. Deficiency of GAMT in the liver causes a hereditary disease with extra pyramidal motor disorder and extremely low concentrations of creatine in the brain, serum and urine [[cite:PUB00035938]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3orh", "name" "Human guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase with SAH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF009285" "Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase", "short" "GuanidinoAc_N-MeTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 273, "taxa" 1256, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 456, "sets" 0, "proteins" 432, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 258}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
