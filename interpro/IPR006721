Both the F1 and F0 complexes are rotary motors that are coupled back-to-back. In the F1 complex, the central gamma subunit forms the rotor inside the cylinder made of the α(3)β(3) subunits, while in the F0 complex, the ring-shaped C subunits forms the rotor. The two rotors rotate in opposite directions, but the F0 rotor is usually stronger, using the force from the proton gradient to push the F1 rotor in reverse in order to drive ATP synthesis  [[cite:PUB00009752]]. These ATPases can also work in reverse in bacteria, hydrolysing ATP to create a proton gradient.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family constitutes the mitochondrial ATP synthase epsilon subunit, which is distinct from the bacterial epsilon subunit (the latter being homologous to the mitochondrial delta subunit, [interpro:IPR001469]). The mitochondrial epsilon subunit is located in the stalk region of the F1 complex, and acts as an inhibitor of the ATPase catalytic core. The epsilon subunit can assume two conformations, contracted and extended, where the latter inhibits ATP hydrolysis. The conformation of the epsilon subunit is determined by the direction of rotation of the gamma subunit, and possibly by the presence of ADP. The extended epsilon subunit is thought to become extended in the presence of ADP, thereby acting as a safety lock to prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00020605]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Drosophila, the protein Stunted which activates the G-protein coupled receptor Methuselah in vitro, leading to increased intracellular calcium ion levels, is embryonically lethal [[cite:PUB00082577], [cite:PUB00082578]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jdi", "name" "Ground state structure of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria (Bovine F1-ATPase crystallised in the absence of azide)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036742", "name" "ATP synthase, F1 complex, epsilon subunit superfamily, mitochondrial", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd12153" "eukaryotic mitochondrial ATP synthase epsilon subunit"}, "pfam" {"PF04627" "Mitochondrial ATP synthase epsilon chain"}, "panther" {"PTHR12448" "ATP SYNTHASE EPSILON CHAIN, MITOCHONDRIAL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP synthase, F1 complex, epsilon subunit, mitochondrial", "short" "ATP_synth_F1_esu_mt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 168, "domain_architectures" 68, "proteomes" 2173, "taxa" 7364, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3614, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3613, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2401}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006721", :literature {"PUB00082577" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ja WW" "Carvalho GB" "Madrigal M" "Roberts RW" "Benzer S."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pro.221", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "The Drosophila G protein-coupled receptor, Methuselah, exhibits a promiscuous response to peptides.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "2203-8", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19672878}, "PUB00068789" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Radax C" "Sigurdsson O" "Hreggvidsson GO" "Aichinger N" "Gruber C" "Kristjansson JK" "Stan-Lotter H."], "ISO_journal" "Syst.
