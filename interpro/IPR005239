{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the bifunctional arginine dihydrolase/ornithine cyclodeaminase ArgZ (also known as as Sll1336), ArgE from Synechocystis sp and similar prokaryotic sequences. ArgZ is involved in an ornithine-ammonia cycle (OAC) in cyanobacteria, which confers substantial adaptability under environmental nitrogen fluctuations. This protein is organised into three domains: a N-terminal domain belonging to the guanidino group-modifying enzyme (GME) family, a middle oxoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme ([interpro:IPR007545]) and a C-terminal region that can be divided in two subdomains ([interpro:IPR048964] and [interpro:IPR048963]) [[cite:PUB00151841]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3c2q", "name" "Crystal structure of conserved putative LOR/SDH protein from Methanococcus maripaludis S2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00300" "TIGR00300 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional arginine dihydrolase/ornithine cyclodeaminase ArgZ/ArgE-like", "short" "ArgZ/ArgE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 474, "taxa" 2863, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2436, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2436, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1895}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
