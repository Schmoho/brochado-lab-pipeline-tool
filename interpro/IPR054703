{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of bacterial proteins that occur regularly in the context of a molybdopterin-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase ([interpro:IPR054705]). The N-terminal 200 amino acids are homologous to the molybdenum cofactor cytidylyltransferase MocA of Escherichia coli. The C-terminal 170 amino acid region contains an HDIG (or HD superfamily) phosphohydrolase-like domain. This family is likely to be involved biosynthesis of the molybdopterin cofactor used by the aldehyde oxidoreductase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045665" "DVU_1551 family NTP transferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdopterin-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase-related", "short" "Mop-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 126, "taxa" 625, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 360, "sets" 0, "proteins" 360, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 290}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054703", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054703", "name" "Molybdopterin-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase-related", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
