{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are dimeric enzymes with activity as 2-methylcitrate synthase, citrate synthase, or both. Many Gram-negative species have a hexameric citrate synthase, termed citrate synthase I. Members of this family appear as a second citrate synthase isozyme, but typically are associated with propionate metabolism and synthesise 2-methylcitrate from propionyl-CoA; citrate synthase activity may be incidental [[cite:PUB00013490]]. A number of species, including Thermoplasma acidophilum, Pyrococcus furiosus, and the Antarctic bacterium DS2-3R have a bifunctional member of this family as the only citrate synthase isozyme.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1aj8", "name" "CITRATE SYNTHASE FROM PYROCOCCUS FURIOSUS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036969", "name" "Citrate synthase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016142", "name" "Citrate synthase-like, large alpha subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01800" "2-methylcitrate synthase/citrate synthase II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-methylcitrate synthase/citrate synthase type I", "short" "2-MeCitrate/Citrate_synth_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3327, "taxa" 14521, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15774, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15774, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12248}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"} {"accession" "GenProp1687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1687"} {"accession" "GenProp1710", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1710"} {"accession" "GenProp0240", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0240"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
