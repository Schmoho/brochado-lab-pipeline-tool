{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome bc1 complex (ubiquinol:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase) is found in mitochondria, photosynthetic bacteria and other prokaryotes. It is minimally composed of three subunits: cytochrome b, carrying a low- and a high-potential haem group; cytochrome c1 (cyt c1); and a high-potential Rieske iron-sulphur protein. The general function of the complex is electron transfer between two mobile redox carriers, ubiquinol and cytochrome c; the electron transfer is coupled with proton translocation across the membrane, thus generating proton-motive force in the form of an electrochemical potential that can drive ATP synthesis. In its structure and functions, the cytochrome bc1 complex bears extensive analogy to the cytochrome b6f complex of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria; cyt c1 plays an analogous role to cytochrome f, in spite of their different structures [[cite:PUB00005442]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes Nitrosomonas europaea petC, which is a subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase complex that catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine, the first reaction in the process of ammonia oxidation to nitrite [[cite:PUB00088040]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3cx5", "name" "Structure of complex III with bound cytochrome c in reduced state and definition of a minimal core interface for electron transfer."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR021157", "name" "Cytochrome c1, transmembrane anchor, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10266" "CYTOCHROME C1"}, "prints" {"PR00603" "CYTOCHROMEC1"}, "pfam" {"PF02167" "Cytochrome C1 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c1", "short" "Cyt_c1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 180, "domain_architectures" 88, "proteomes" 5272, "taxa" 18701, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16999, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16628, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12197}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0613", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0613"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
