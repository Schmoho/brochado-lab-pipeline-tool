{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Calcipressins (RCANs) are a novel family of calcineurin regulators that have been suggested as key factors contributing to Down syndrome in humans. Three human calcipressins have been identified, calcipressin 1-3. Calcipressin 1 is also known as modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 (MCIP1), Adapt78 and Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1). Calcipressin 2 is variously known as MCIP2, ZAKI-4 and DSCR1-like 1. Calcipressin 3 is also called MCIP3 and DSCR1-like 2 [[cite:PUB00044052]]. Calcipressins contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), a highly conserved SP repeat domain containing the phosphorylation site by GSK-3, a well-known PxIxIT motif responsible for docking many substrates to calcineurin, and a C-terminal TxxP motif [[cite:PUB00084625]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calcineurin is a calcium-responsive enzyme that dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). In doing so, it promotes its nuclear translocation and uniquely links calcium signalling to transcriptional regulation [[cite:PUB00044052]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6uuq", "name" "Structure of Calcineurin bound to RCAN1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04847" "Calcipressin"}, "panther" {"PTHR10300" "CALCIPRESSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Calcipressin", "short" "Calcipressin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 44, "proteomes" 2161, "taxa" 7129, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5686, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5592, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3722}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006931", :literature {"PUB00044052" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Parry RV" "June CH."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
