{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This PAC2 (Proteasome assembly chaperone) family of proteins is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Proteins in this family are typically between 247 and 307 amino acids in length. Its C-terminal segment containing the potential proteasome-activating HbYX motif. These proteins function as a chaperone for the 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass and contains one 20S core particle structure and two 19S regulatory caps. The 26S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. A number of studies including very recent ones have revealed that assembly of its 20S catalytic core particle is an ordered process that involves several conserved proteasome assembly chaperones (PACs). Two heterodimeric chaperones, PAC1-PAC2 and PAC3-PAC4, promote the assembly of rings composed of seven alpha subunits [[cite:PUB00053374], [cite:PUB00053375], [cite:PUB00044890], [cite:PUB00043418]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents PAC2 family members found in eukaryotes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038389", "name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone 2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12970" "PROTEASOME ASSEMBLY CHAPERONE 2"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF010044" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP010044 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasome assembly chaperone 2, eukaryotic", "short" "Proteasome_assmbl_chp_2_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1630, "taxa" 6132, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2807, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2777, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1849}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016562", :literature {"PUB00044890" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Le Tallec B" "Barrault MB" "Courbeyrette R" "Guerois R" "Marsolier-Kergoat MC" "Peyroche A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
