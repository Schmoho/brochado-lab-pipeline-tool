{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Endolysin is a lysozyme that hydrolyses the (1->4)-beta-glycosidic linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan [[cite:PUB00084190]]. Endolysin and the cell membrane pore-forming proteins holin and spanin act together to bring about host cell lysis and release of virus particles [[cite:PUB00084191]].</p>\n\n<p>This family includes SAR-endolysins (signal-anchor-release endolysins) from bacteriophages and prophage lysozymes mostly from Proteobacteria.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike T4 E phage lysozyme, the endolysin R21 from Enterobacteria phage P21 has an N-terminal SAR (signal-arrest-release) domain that anchors the endolysin to the membrane in an inactive form, which act to prevent premature lysis of the infected bacterium. The dsDNA phages of eubacteria use endolysins or muralytic enzymes in conjunction with hollin, a small membrane protein, to degrade the peptidoglycan found in bacterial cell walls  [[cite:PUB00094465], [cite:PUB00094466], [cite:PUB00094465]]. Similarly, prophage lysozymes containing the SAR domain facilitate the biosynthesis of its cell wall heteropolymer peptidoglycan and cell division in bacteria [[cite:PUB00094501]]. These enzymes cleave the glycosidic beta 1,4-bonds between the N-acetylmuramic acid and the N-acetylglucosamine of the peptidoglycan [[cite:PUB00094465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hdf", "name" "Crystal structure of truncated endolysin R21 from phage 21"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023347", "name" "Lysozyme domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023346", "name" "Lysozyme-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04136" "SAR-endolysin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SAR-endolysin-like", "short" "SAR_endolysin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 408, "taxa" 2804, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3945, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3945, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2312}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
