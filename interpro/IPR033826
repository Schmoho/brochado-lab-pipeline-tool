{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Isoaspartyl dipeptidase (MEROPS identifier M38.001) hydrolyzes the β-L-isoaspartyl linkages in dipeptides, as part of the degradative pathway to eliminate proteins with β-L-isoaspartyl peptide bonds, bonds whereby the β-group of an aspartate forms the peptide link with the amino group of the following amino acid. Formation of this bond is a spontaneous nonenzymatic reaction in nature and can profoundly affect the function of the protein. Isoaspartyl dipeptidase is an octameric enzyme that contains a binuclear zinc centre in the active site of each subunit and shows a strong preference of hydrolyzing Asp-Leu dipeptides [[cite:PUB00029931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1onw", "name" "Crystal structure of Isoaspartyl Dipeptidase from E. coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011059", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase, composite domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01308" "Isoaspartyl-dipeptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Isoaspartyl-dipeptidase", "short" "Isoaspartyl-dipeptidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 208, "sets" 0, "proteins" 208, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 142}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
