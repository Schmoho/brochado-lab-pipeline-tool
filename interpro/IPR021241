{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CsiV, a small periplasmic protein (cell-shape integrity in Vibrio), is essential for growth of Vibrio cholerae in the presence of DAA, non-canonical amino-acids, the typical components of peptidoglycan side-chains in Vibrio cholerae. CsiV interacts with LpoA, the lipoprotein activator of penicillin-binding-protein1A that is necessary for mediating the assembly of peptidoglycan.  CsiV acts through LpoA to promote peptidoglycan biogenesis in V. cholerae and other vibrio species as well as in the other genera where this protein is found [[cite:PUB00075620]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10972" "Peptidoglycan-binding protein, CsiV"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidoglycan-binding protein, CsiV", "short" "CsiV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 543, "taxa" 2707, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3757, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3193, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2415}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021241", :literature {"PUB00075620" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Dorr T" "Lam H" "Alvarez L" "Cava F" "Davis BM" "Waldor MK."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004433", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "A novel peptidoglycan binding protein crucial for PBP1A-mediated cell wall biogenesis in Vibrio cholerae.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "e1004433", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24945690}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR021241", "name" "Peptidoglycan-binding protein, CsiV", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 15, "alignment:full" 554}}}
