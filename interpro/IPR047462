{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from invertebrates, including C-mannosyltransferase dpy-19 from Caenorhabditis elegans. Dpy19 are transmembrane domain proteins whose name is derived from the Caenorhabditis elegans Dumpy mutant. They are C-mannosyltransferases that mediate C-mannosylation of tryptophan residues on target proteins. C-mannosylation is the attachment of alpha-mannose to the indole C2 carbon of the first tryptophan residue in the consensus amino acid sequence Trp-Xaa-Xaa-Trp/Cys through a C-C bond. This reaction takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen [[cite:PUB00044879], [cite:PUB00071504], [cite:PUB00044880]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20177" "C-mannosyltransferase Dpy19"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "C-mannosyltransferase Dpy19", "short" "Dpy19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 129, "taxa" 766, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 280, "sets" 0, "proteins" 280, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 164}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
