{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome is characterised by usually severe pigmentary retinopathy, early-onset obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, renal malformation and mental retardation [[cite:PUB00069263]]. Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8/TTC8, BBS9 and BBIP10) form the BBSome complex, which functions as a coat complex required for sorting of specific membrane proteins to the primary cilia [[cite:PUB00153355], [cite:PUB00153353], [cite:PUB00060532], [cite:PUB00153354]]. The ciliary trafficking function of BBSome is regulated by LZTFL1 (Leucine-zipper transcription factor-like 1)  [[cite:PUB00069264]].</p>\n\n<p>Primary cilia are ubiquitous cellular appendages that provide important sensory and signalling functions and their dysfunction underlies numerous human genetic disorders. The proteins disrupted in the human ciliary disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are required for the localisation of G protein-coupled receptors to primary cilia on central neurons. The alteration of signalling caused by mislocalisation of ciliary signalling proteins underlies the BBS phenotype [[cite:PUB00043592]]. Of the 12 known BBS genes, BBS1 is the most commonly mutated [[cite:PUB00043593]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes BBS1, is the most important BBSome subunit for cargo recognition as it mediates the interaction of the GTP-bound Arf-like GTPase ARL6 with the BBSome, a critical step in the recruitment of the BBSome to membranes [[cite:PUB00153355]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR20870" "BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BBSome complex member BBS1", "short" "BBS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 777, "taxa" 3430, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1962, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1962, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1229}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028784", :literature {"PUB00060532" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Nachury MV" "Loktev AV" "Zhang Q" "Westlake CJ" "Peranen J" "Merdes A" "Slusarski DC" "Scheller RH" "Bazan JF" "Sheffield VC" "Jackson PK."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.053", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A core complex of BBS proteins cooperates with the GTPase Rab8 to promote ciliary membrane biogenesis.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "1201-13", "volume" "129", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17574030}, "PUB00069264" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Seo S" "Zhang Q" "Bugge K" "Breslow DK" "Searby CC" "Nachury MV" "Sheffield VC."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002358", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "A novel protein LZTFL1 regulates ciliary trafficking of the BBSome and Smoothened.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e1002358", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22072986}, "PUB00069263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Mykytyn K" "Nishimura DY" "Searby CC" "Shastri M" "Yen HJ" "Beck JS" "Braun T" "Streb LM" "Cornier AS" "Cox GF" "Fulton AB" "Carmi R" "Luleci G" "Chandrasekharappa SC" "Collins FS" "Jacobson SG" "Heckenlively JR" "Weleber RG" "Stone EM" "Sheffield VC."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
