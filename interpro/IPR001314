{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of serine peptidases and non-peptidase homologues belong to the MEROPS peptidase family S1, subfamily S1A (chymotrypsin subfamily, clan PA(S)). These peptidases contain the catalytic triad histidine, aspartate and serine found in all members of subfamily S1A. Testes-specific protein TSP50 is also included in this family which has the serine replaced by threonine, although the serine is conserved in many vertebrates [[cite:PUB00095105]]. The type example being chymotrypsin A from Bos taurus (Bovine).</p>\n\n<p>Members of the chymotrypsin family may occasionally function intracellularly (for example, the intracellular digestion of bacteria in neutrophils), but\nmost function extracellularly, for example in roles such as food digestion, fibrinolysis and complement activation [[cite:PUB00003576]]. The essential catalytic unit of the chymotrypsin family is around 220 amino acids in length, although the protein may be extended at the N terminus with unrelated sequences, often containing modules. They are rarely extended at the C terminus: exceptions include acrosin, complement component C2, and coagulation factor X, which has a 16 residue extension that is removed upon activation [[cite:PUB00003576]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043504", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan, chymotrypsin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009003", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00722" "CHYMOTRYPSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S1A, chymotrypsin family", "short" "Peptidase_S1A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2479, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3536, "taxa" 15059, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 1, "matches" 448240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 155502, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 101379}, "pathways" 242}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
