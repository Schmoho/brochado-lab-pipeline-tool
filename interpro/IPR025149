{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is found in cyanobacteria and is functionally uncharacterised. Proteins in this family are approximately 90 amino acids in length. A member of this family, the ssr1528 gene was found to be regulated by an sRNA NsiR4 [[cite:PUB00088099]]. In addition, the expression of that gene was repressed under conditions of nitrogen depletion, suggesting it may have a role related to cellular nitrogen status [[cite:PUB00088099]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13319" "Protein of unknown function (DUF4090)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF4090", "short" "DUF4090"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 160, "taxa" 1042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 639, "sets" 0, "proteins" 639, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 463}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025149", :literature {"PUB00088099" {"URL" nil, "issue" "45", "authors" ["Klahn S" "Schaal C" "Georg J" "Baumgartner D" "Knippen G" "Hagemann M" "Muro-Pastor AM" "Hess WR."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
