{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes bacterial tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase (TCHQD) pcpC and its homologues from plants. Sphingobium chlorophenolicum pcpC is a zeta-class glutathione S-transferase that catalyses the isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate, which is an essential step in the catabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine. It also catalyses the dechlorination of dichloroacetate to glyoxylate and isomerizes maleylacetone (an analog of maleylacetoacetate) and consumes dichloroacetate [[cite:PUB00096544]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45374" "GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE TCHQD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase", "short" "TCHQD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 316, "taxa" 1479, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 765, "sets" 0, "proteins" 765, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 486}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
