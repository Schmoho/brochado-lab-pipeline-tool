{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ferredoxin-NADP+ (oxido)reductase is an FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible electron transfer between NADP(H) and electron carrier proteins such as ferredoxin and flavodoxin. Isoforms of these flavoproteins (i.e. having a non-covalently bound FAD as a prosthetic group) are present in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria in which they participate in a wide variety of redox metabolic pathways. The C-terminal domain contains most of the NADP(H) binding residues and the N-terminal domain interacts non-covalently with the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin molecule which lies largely in a large gap betweed the two domains. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase first accepts one electron from reduced ferredoxin to form a flavin semiquinone intermediate. The enzyme then accepts a second electron to form FADH2 which then transfers two electrons and a proton to NADP+ to form NADPH [[cite:PUB00081617], [cite:PUB00081618]].</p>\n\n<p>This family consists of Ferredoxin--NADP reductase from bacteria [[cite:PUB00081619], [cite:PUB00039636], [cite:PUB00153390]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4k1x", "name" "Ferredoxin-NADP(H) Reductase mutant with Ala 266 replaced by Tyr (A266Y) and residues 267-272 deleted."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR039261", "name" "Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR), nucleotide-binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06195" "FNR1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferredoxin--NADP reductase, bacteria", "short" "FNR_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2579, "taxa" 10944, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13871, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13871, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10905}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
