{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Iron is essential for growth in both bacteria and mammals. Controlling the amount of free iron in solution is often used as a tactic by hosts to limit invasion of pathogenic microbes; binding iron tightly within protein molecules can accomplish this. Such iron-protein complexes include haem in blood, lactoferrin in tears/saliva and transferrin in blood plasma. Some bacteria express surface receptors to capture eukaryotic iron-binding compounds, while others have evolved siderophores to scavenge iron from iron-binding host proteins [[cite:PUB00006650]].</p>\n\n<p>The absence of free iron molecules in the surrounding environment triggers transcription of gene clusters that encode both siderophore-synthesis enzymes, and receptors that recognise iron-bound siderophores [[cite:PUB00006626]]. Classic examples are the enterobactin/enterochelin clusters found in Escherichia coli and Salmonella, although similar moieties in other pathogens have been identified. The enzymic machinery that produces vibrionectin in Vibrio cholerae is such a homologue [[cite:PUB00006668]].</p>\n\n<p>EntD (also known as 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase EntD) forms part of the enterobactin-synthetase enzyme complex. It plays an essential role in the assembly of the enterobactin by catalysing the transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) moiety from coenzyme A to the apo-domains of both EntB (ArCP domain) and EntF (PCP domain) to yield their holo-forms which make them competent for the activation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) and L-serine, respectively [[cite:PUB00091542]]. Deletion studies involving EntD- mutants have shown that it is essential for virulence [[cite:PUB00006627]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also identifies some 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4qjl", "name" "Crystal structure of M. ulcerans phosphopantetheinyl transferase MuPPT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037143", "name" "4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR38096" "ENTEROBACTIN SYNTHASE COMPONENT D"}, "prints" {"PR01399" "ENTSNTHTASED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Enterobactin synthetase-like, component D", "short" "Enbac_synth_compD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1645, "taxa" 7731, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8755, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8703, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6606}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
