{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are bacterial transport systems implicated in the import of small molecules into the cytoplasm. Tetratricopeptide repeat-protein associated TRAP transporters (TPATs) constitute a subfamily of the TRAP transporters (TRAP-Ts). TPATs have four components. Three are common to both TRAP-Ts and TPATs: the P component, a ligand-binding protein, and a transmembrane symporter apparatus comprising the M and Q components (M and Q are sometimes fused to form a single polypeptide). TPATs are distinguished from TRAP-Ts by the presence of a unique protein called the T-component [[cite:PUB00059341]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>TatT (TRAP transporter T-component) consists of a 13-Î±-helical fold containing cryptic tetratricopeptide repeat motifs (cTPRs) and encompassing a pore, ie is a water-soluble trimer whose protomers are each perforated by a pore.
