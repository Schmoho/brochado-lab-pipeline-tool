{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Polyamines such as spermidine and spermine are essential for cellular growth under most conditions, being implicated in a large number of cellular processes including DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) plays an essential regulatory role in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway by generating the n-propylamine residue required for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine from putrescein [[cite:PUB00035745], [cite:PUB00035746]]. Unlike many amino acid decarboxylases AdoMetDC uses a covalently bound pyruvate residue as a cofactor rather than the more common pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. These proteins can be divided into two main groups which show little sequence similarity either to each other, or to other pyruvoyl-dependent amino acid decarboxylases: class I enzymes found in bacteria and archaea, and class II enzymes found in eukaryotes. In both groups the active enzyme is generated by the post-translational autocatalytic cleavage of a precursor protein. This cleavage generates the pyruvate precursor from an internal serine residue and results in the formation of two non-identical subunits termed alpha and beta which form the active enzyme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents a set of known and predicted AdoMetDC enzymes from proteobacteria. The Escherichia coli enzyme is a heterooctamer composed of four alpha and four beta chains, and is dependent on mgnesium for activity [[cite:PUB00035747]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00465" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme [speD]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001356" "Predicted bacterial adenosylmethionine decarboxylase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03331" "adenosylmethionine decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, bacterial", "short" "S-AdoMet_deCO2ase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1052, "taxa" 4840, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4411, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4411, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3473}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1596", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1596"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
