{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of tyrosine-protein phosphatases, including human tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 12/18/22. PTN22 acts as negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling by direct dephosphorylation of the Src family kinases LCK and FYN, ITAMs of the TCRz/CD3 complex, as well as ZAP70, VAV, VCP and other key signalling molecules [[cite:PUB00036118], [cite:PUB00102089]]. PTN12 dephosphorylates a range of proteins, and thereby regulates cellular signaling cascades [[cite:PUB00068601]], such as ERBB2 and PTK2B/PYK2, and thereby regulates signalling via ERBB2 and PTK2B/PYK2 [[cite:PUB00102091], [cite:PUB00102090]]. PTN18 may be involved in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4gfu", "name" "PTPN18 in complex with HER2-pY1248 phosphor-peptides"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45983" "TYROSINE PHOSPHATSE N18, PUTATIVE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 12/18/22", "short" "PTN12/18/22"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 801, "taxa" 3844, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4560, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4560, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3029}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
