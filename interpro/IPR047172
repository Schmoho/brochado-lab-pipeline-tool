{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ajuba-like LIM domain-containing protein family includes three highly homologous proteins Ajuba, LIMD1, and WTIP, adapter or scaffold proteins that participate in the assembly of numerous protein complexes and are involved in several cellular processes such as cell fate determination, cytoskeletal organization, repression of gene transcription, mitosis, cell-cell adhesion, cell differentiation, proliferation and migration [[cite:PUB00102093]]. They bind to Ago1/2, RCK, Dcp2, and eIF4E in vivo, being required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing. These three proteins bind to the mRNA 5' m(7)GTP cap-protein complex [[cite:PUB00069115]]. Members of this family negatively regulates the Hippo signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00069114]]. WTIP, the Wt1-interacting protein, was originally identified as an interaction partner of the Wilms tumour protein 1 (WT1). WTIP is involved in kidney and neural crest development. It interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 and inhibits canonical Wnt signaling.</p>\n\n<p>LIMD1 was reported to inhibit cell growth and metastases; it has been described that LIMD1 functions as tumour suppressor to block lung tumour cell line in vitro and in vivo [[cite:PUB00069113], [cite:PUB00069117]]. The inhibition may be mediated through an interaction with the protein barrier-to-autointegration (BAF), a component of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling protein; or through the interaction with retinoblastoma protein (pRB), resulting in inhibition of E2F-mediated transcription, and expression of the majority of genes with E2F1-responsive elements. Recently, LIMD1 was shown to interact with the p62/sequestosome protein and influence IL-1 and RANKL signalling by facilitating the assembly of a p62/TRAF6/a-PKC multi-protein complex.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the family contain three tandem C-terminal LIM domains and a proline-rich N-terminal region.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24219" "LIM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN JUB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ajuba-like", "short" "Ajuba-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 921, "taxa" 3699, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3106, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3106, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1921}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047172", :literature {"PUB00069114" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Das Thakur M" "Feng Y" "Jagannathan R" "Seppa MJ" "Skeath JB" "Longmore GD."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
