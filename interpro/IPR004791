{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Eubacteria and some Archaea, the first steps in nucleotide excision repair are carried out by the coordinated action of the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins. A damage recognition complex composed of 2 UvrA and 2 UvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities. Upon binding of the UvrA(2)B(2) complex to a putative damaged site, the DNA wraps around one UvrB monomer. DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB Î²-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and the second UvrB is released. If no lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other UvrB subunit that will check the other stand for damage [[cite:PUB00057848]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents UvrC, which is recruited to the UvrB-bound lesion site and cuts the DNA backbone both 5' and 3' to the lesion on the same strand [[cite:PUB00088372]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038476", "name" "UvrC, RNAse H endonuclease domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00203" "UvrABC system protein C [uvrC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00194" "excinuclease ABC subunit UvrC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UvrABC system, subunit C", "short" "UvrC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8927, "taxa" 34529, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40574, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40574, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30862}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1190", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1190"} {"accession" "GenProp0114", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0114"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004791", :literature {"PUB00057848" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Verhoeven EE" "Wyman C" "Moolenaar GF" "Goosen N."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf396", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The presence of two UvrB subunits in the UvrAB complex ensures damage detection in both DNA strands.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "4196-205", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12145219}, "PUB00088372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Springall L" "Hughes CD" "Simons M" "Azinas S" "Van Houten B" "Kad NM."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1244", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Recruitment of UvrBC complexes to UV-induced damage in the absence of UvrA increases cell survival.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1256-1265", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29240933}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009381", "name" "excinuclease ABC activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006289", "name" "nucleotide-excision repair", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009380", "name" "excinuclease repair complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004791", "name" "UvrABC system, subunit C", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
