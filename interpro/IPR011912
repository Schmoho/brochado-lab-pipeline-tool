{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are glycolipids that consitutes the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00028103]]. They consist of lipid A (endotoxin) which anchors LPS to the outer membrane, a non-repeating core oligosachharide, and an immunogenic O-antigen repeat polymer, which is an oligosaccharide of 1-40 units that variesbetween different strains of bacteria. Although the O-antigen and most of the core domain are not necessary for growth in the lab, they appear to help bacteria resist environmental stresses including the complement system and antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family consists of examples of ADP-L-glycero-D-mannoheptose-6-epimerase, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the inner core of LPS in Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00024627]]. This enzyme is homologous to UDP-glucose 4-epimerase ([interpro:IPR005886]) and belongs to the NAD dependent epimerase/dehydratase family. It participates in the biosynthetic pathway leading to incorporation of heptose, a conserved sugar, into the core region of LPS, performing the NAD-dependent reaction shown below:\r\n\r\n<reaction>ADP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose = ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose</reaction>\r\n\r\nIt is a homopentameric enzyme with each monomer composed of two domains: an N-terminal modified Rossman fold domain for NADP binding, and a C-terminal substrate binding domain.  This subgroup has the canonical active site tetrad and NAD(P)-binding motif [[cite:PUB00081102]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Extended short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (α/β folding pattern with a central β-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG].XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif [[cite:PUB00027779], [cite:PUB00027780], [cite:PUB00000419], [cite:PUB00081093], [cite:PUB00081094], [cite:PUB00081095], [cite:PUB00081096], [cite:PUB00081097]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1eq2", "name" "THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ADP-L-GLYCERO-D-MANNOHEPTOSE 6-EPIMERASE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05248" "ADP-L-glycero-D-mannoheptose 6-epimerase (GME), extended (e) SDRs"}, "hamap" {"MF_01601" "ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6-epimerase [hldD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02197" "ADP-glyceromanno-heptose 6-epimerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6-epimerase", "short" "Heptose_epim"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1741, "taxa" 8903, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9668, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9668, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7359}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0203", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0203"} {"accession" "GenProp1239", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1239"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
