{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The GyaR family of glyoxylate reductases catalyses the NADH-linked reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate. This family is found in hyperthermophilic archaea, where it is thought to play an important role in the glyoxylate and 3-hydroxypropionic acid cycles [[cite:PUB00054275]]. Structurally, GyaR is similar to other NADH-linked dehydrogenases [[cite:PUB00047236]]. The enzyme's thermostability appears to be due to the presence of aromatic clusters and the fact that it has more ion pairs and a relatively lower hydrophobic accessible surface area than mesophilic enzymes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6bii", "name" "Crystal Structure of Pyrococcus yayanosii Glyoxylate Hydroxypyruvate Reductase in complex with NADP and malonate (re-refinement of 5AOW)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00776" "Glyoxylate reductase [gyaR]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glyoxylate reductase GyaR", "short" "Glyoxylate_reductase_GyaR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 75, "sets" 0, "proteins" 75, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 61}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
