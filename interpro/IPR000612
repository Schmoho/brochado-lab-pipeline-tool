{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteolipid membrane potential modulator is an evolutionarily conserved proteolipid in the plasma membrane which, in S. pombe, is transcriptionally regulated by the Spc1 stress MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) pathway. It functions to modulate the membrane potential, particularly to resist high cellular cation concentration. In eukaryotic organisms, stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases play crucial roles in transmitting environmental signals that will regulate gene expression for allowing the cell to adapt to cellular stress.
