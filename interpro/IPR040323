{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry contain WD40 repeats. This entry includes mammalian EARP and GARP complex-interacting protein 1 (EIPR1 or TSSC1), which is a component of the endosomal retrieval machinery, binding to both the tethering complexes GARP and EARP. GARP participates in SNARE-dependent fusion of endosome-derived carriers with the trans-Golgi network, wheras EARP does the same for recycling endosomes [[cite:PUB00090818]]. Also included in this family is the EARP-interacting protein 1 from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which trafficks cargo to the dense-core vesicle, a secretory organelle that mediates the regulated release of peptide hormones, growth factors, and biogenic amines and which originates from the trans-Golgi of neurons and neuroendocrine cells [[cite:PUB00090819]]. The WD repeat-containing protein DWA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana is also a member of this family. DWA2 is a component of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that acts as negative regulator in abscisic acid signaling [[cite:PUB00090820]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14205" "WD-REPEAT PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EARP and GARP complex-interacting protein 1", "short" "EIPR1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1479, "taxa" 5830, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3111, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2046}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040323", :literature {"PUB00090818" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Gershlick DC" "Schindler C" "Chen Y" "Bonifacino JS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
