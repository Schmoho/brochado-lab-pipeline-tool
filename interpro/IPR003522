{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Secretion of virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria involves transportation of the protein across two membranes to reach the cell exterior. There have been four secretion systems described in animal enteropathogens such as Salmonella and Yersinia, with further sequence similarities in plant pathogens like Ralstonia and Erwinia [[cite:PUB00007897]].</p>\n\n<p>The type III secretion system is of great interest, as it is used to transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell [[cite:PUB00007898], [cite:PUB00089534]] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with the host. The protein subunits of the system are very similar to those of bacterial flagellar biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00007583]]. However, while the latter forms a ring structure to allow secretion of flagellin and is an integral part of the flagellum itself [[cite:PUB00007583]], type III subunits in the outer membrane translocate secreted proteins through a channel-like structure. The structure core of this system consists of the needle complex, a continuous channel formed by the highly oligomerized inner and outer membrane hollow rings and a polymerized helical needle filament which spans through and projects into the infected host cell [[cite:PUB00097873]].</p>\n\n<p>This family aids in the structural assembly of the invasion complex [[cite:PUB00007701]]. Another characteristic of this family is its ability to form a channel through the outer bacterial membrane, allowing secretion to take place. Members include the Salmonella InvG and SpiA gene, the Shigella MxiD, and the Yersinia Kim5 and YscC proteins [[cite:PUB00106886]]. Plant pathogen members include the Hypersensitivity Response (HR) genes of Burkholderia and Erwinia.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02219" "Type 3 secretion system secretin [sctC]"}, "prints" {"PR01337" "Type III secretion system outer membrane G protein family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02516" "type III secretion system outer membrane ring subunit SctC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system outer membrane pore YscC/HrcC", "short" "T3SS_OM_pore_YscC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 299, "taxa" 2423, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4071, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3524, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2854}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003522", :literature {"PUB00007897" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Mecsas JJ" "Strauss EJ."], "ISO_journal" "Emerging Infect.
