{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hexokinase ([ec:2.7.1.1]) [[cite:PUB00000566], [cite:PUB00001951]] is an important glycolytic enzyme that catalyses\nthe phosphorylation of keto- and aldohexoses (e.g. glucose, mannose and\nfructose) using MgATP as the phosphoryl donor.</p>\n\n<p>In vertebrates there are four major isoenzymes, commonly referred as types I,\nII, III and IV. Type IV hexokinase, which is often incorrectly designated\nglucokinase [[cite:PUB00005375]], is only expressed in liver and pancreatic beta-cells and\nplays an important role in modulating insulin secretion; it is a protein of a\nmolecular mass of about 50 Kd. Hexokinases of types I to III, which have low\nKm values for glucose, have a molecular mass of about 100 Kd. Structurally\nthey consist of a very small N-terminal hydrophobic membrane-binding domain\nfollowed by two highly similar domains of 450 residues. The first domain has\nlost its catalytic activity and has evolved into a regulatory domain.</p>\n\n<p>In yeast there are three different isoenzymes: hexokinase PI (gene HXK1), PII\n(gene HXKB), and glucokinase (gene GLK1). All three proteins have a molecular\nmass of about 50 Kd.</p>\n\n<p>The hexokinase domain has an α/β fold and is distinctly folded in two\nsubdomains of unequal size: the large and small subdomains.\nThe large subdomain comprises a six-stranded mixed β-sheet and a number of\nadditional α-helices. On one side, the sheet packs against the small\nsubdomain, and on the other side it is shielded by several α-helices. The\ndominant feature of the small subdomain is a five stranded mixed β-sheet.\nThe sheet is flanked by two helices on one side and by one helix on the other.\nThe subdomain also has an additional β-sheet formed by two antiparallel\nstrands [[cite:PUB00014215], [cite:PUB00036888]].</p>\n\n<p>All these enzymes contain one (or two in the case of types I to III isozymes)\nstrongly conserved region which has been shown [[cite:PUB00000147]] to be involved in substrate binding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6ksr", "name" "Crystal structure of Hexokinase from Eimeria tenella"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19443" "HEXOKINASE"}, "profile" {"PS51748" "Hexokinase domain profile"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hexokinase", "short" "Hexokinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 82, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2773, "taxa" 10025, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27412, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14298}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00370", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00370"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
