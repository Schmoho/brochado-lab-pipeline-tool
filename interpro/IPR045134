{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes UHRF1/2 from animals and ORTHRUS 1-5 from Arabidopsis. They are ubiquitin-like proteins with PHD and RING finger domains. UHRF1, also known as ICBP90, is a transcription and cell cycle regulator and a methyl K9 H3-specific binding protein [[cite:PUB00098111]]. UHRF2 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase for cell cycle proteins, such as CCND1 and CCNE1 [[cite:PUB00098113]]. It can also act as a SUMO E3 ligase for ZNF131 [[cite:PUB00098112]]. This family also includes UHRF1-like protein from Cryptococcus neoformans, which binds hemimethylated DNA and is involved in DNA methylation maintenance. Unlike the human orthologue, UHRF1-like lacks the Tudor H3K9me reader and RING E3 ligase domains found in its human ortholog [[cite:PUB00100189]].</p>\n\n<p>In plants, ORTHRUS family members are E3 ligases mediating DNA methylation status in vivo. ORTH1-ORTH5 are predicted to encode proteins that contain one plant homeodomain (PHD), two really interesting new gene (RING) domains, and one set ring associated (SRA) domain [[cite:PUB00098116]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3asl", "name" "Structure of UHRF1 in complex with histone tail"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14140" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE UHRF-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UHRF1/2-like", "short" "UHRF1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 62, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1948, "taxa" 7042, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6393, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6393, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3851}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
