{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Der GTPase-activating protein YihI from Escherichia coli (strain K12)  and similar proteins predominantly found in Gammaproteobacteria. YihI is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that modifies the activity of  Der, a 50S ribosomal subunit stability factor. The stimulation is specific to Der as YihI does not stimulate the GTPase activity of Era or ObgE. The interaction of YihI with Der requires only the C-terminal 78 amino acids of YihI  [[cite:PUB00053968]].   A yihI deletion mutant is viable and shows a shorter lag period, but the same post-lag growth rate as a wild-type strain. yihI is expressed during the lag period. Overexpression of yihI inhibits cell growth and biogenesis of the 50S ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00053968]].  YihI is an unusual, highly hydrophilic protein with an uneven distribution of charged residues, resulting in an N-terminal region with high pI and a C-terminal region with low pI [[cite:PUB00053968]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01058" "Der GTPase-activating protein YihI [yihI]"}, "pfam" {"PF04220" "Der GTPase activator (YihI)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Der GTPase-activating protein YihI", "short" "YihI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 381, "taxa" 2407, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2402, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2395, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1858}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007336", :literature {"PUB00053968" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Hwang J" "Inouye M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
