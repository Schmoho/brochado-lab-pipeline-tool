{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is composed of five highly homologous small secreted proteins, TAFA1-5. These proteins contain conserved cysteine residues at fixed positions, and are distantly related to MIP-1alpha, a member of the CC-chemokine family. The FAM19/TAFA proteins are predominantly expressed in specific regions of the brain, and are postulated to function as brain-specific chemokines or neurokines that act as regulators of immune and nervous cells [[cite:PUB00045989]]. Mouse TAFA2 is involved in neuronal survival and neurobiological functions [[cite:PUB00092771]]. TAFA5 has been shown to inhibit postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling [[cite:PUB00090824]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12020" "TAFA family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chemokine-like protein TAFA", "short" "Chemokine-like_TAFA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 648, "taxa" 2182, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5540, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3618}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020350", :literature {"PUB00092771" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Wang X" "Shen C" "Chen X" "Wang J" "Cui X" "Wang Y" "Zhang H" "Tang L" "Lu S" "Fei J" "Wang Z."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Biochim.
