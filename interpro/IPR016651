This affects the heteromultimeric composition of PP2A which in turn affects protein recognition and substrate specificity. Like many other methyltransferases Ppm1 uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Ppm1 contains the common SAM-dependent methyltransferase core fold, with various insertions and additions creating a specific PP2A binding site [[cite:PUB00030688]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ob1", "name" "ppm1 with 1,8-ANS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016305" "Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase, LCMT1 type"}, "panther" {"PTHR13600" "LEUCINE CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1", "short" "LCMT1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2513, "taxa" 8676, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4863, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4664, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3081}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
