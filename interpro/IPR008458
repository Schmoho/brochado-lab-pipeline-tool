Gene 5 contains two (5a and 5b) open reading frames [[cite:PUB00008387]]. This entry represents the host translation inhibitor 5b (ORF 5b, also known as accessory protein 5b) which is involved in host translation shut off without degrading host RNA. It suppresses host gene expression which facilitates evasion from host type I interferon immune response [[cite:PUB00099597]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05528" "Accessory protein 5b, avian coronavirus"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Accessory protein 5b, avian coronavirus", "short" "Acc_prot_5b_avian_CoV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 317, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008458", :literature {"PUB00008387" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jia W" "Naqi SA."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(96)00847-5", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Sequence analysis of gene 3, gene 4 and gene 5 of avian infectious bronchitis virus strain CU-T2.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "189-93", "volume" "189", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9168126}, "PUB00099597" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Kint J" "Langereis MA" "Maier HJ" "Britton P" "van Kuppeveld FJ" "Koumans J" "Wiegertjes GF" "Forlenza M."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Limits Interferon Production by Inducing a Host Shutoff That Requires Accessory Protein 5b.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "7519-7528", "volume" "90", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27279618}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008458", "name" "Accessory protein 5b, avian coronavirus", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 5}}}
