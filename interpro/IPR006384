{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs [[cite:PUB00003337]]. The subfamilies are defined [[cite:PUB00009589]] based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called capping domain [[cite:PUB00009540]], or the absence of such a domain. Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs. Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs. Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions.</p>\n\n<p>The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an Î± helical bundle. Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an apparent phylogenetic bifurcation. This group of sequences belong to the IB subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2fea", "name" "Crystal structure of MtnX phosphatase from Bacillus Subtilis at 2.00 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01489" "MtnX-like HAD-IB family phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD hydrolase, subfamily IA, Pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase-like", "short" "HAD_hydro_PyrdxlP_Pase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2848, "taxa" 10516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9703, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6562}, "pathways" 51}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1702", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1702"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
