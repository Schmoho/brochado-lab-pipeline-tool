{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a narrow clade of cyanobacterial deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase (or DNA photolyase). This group, in contrast to several closely related proteins, uses a chromophore that, in other lineages is modified further to become coenzyme F420. This chromophore is called 8-HDF in most articles on the DNA photolyase and FO in most literature on coenzyme F420. This entry includes PhrA from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. PhrA is a DNA photolyase responsible for the majority of the observed UV resistance in Synechocystis 6803 [[cite:PUB00076734], [cite:PUB00076735]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The cryptochrome and photolyase families consist of structurally related flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) proteins that use the absorption of blue light to accomplish different tasks.

On the basis of the primary structure, the cryptochrome/DNA photolyase family can be grouped into two classes [[cite:PUB00001269]].
