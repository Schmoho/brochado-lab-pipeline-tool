{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes proteins similar to prohibitin (a lipid raft-associated integral membrane protein). Individual proteins of the SPFH (band 7) domain superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes [[cite:PUB00080176]]. These microdomains, in addition to being stable scaffolds, may also be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions [[cite:PUB00019208], [cite:PUB00080174]]. Prohibitin is a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein which may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Human prohibitin forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with Bap-37 (prohibitin 2, an SPFH domain carrying homologue). This complex may protect non-assembled membrane proteins against proteolysis by the m-AAA protease [[cite:PUB00080922], [cite:PUB00080923]]. Prohibitin and Bap-37 yeast homologues have been implicated in yeast longevity [[cite:PUB00080921]] and in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. Sequence comparisons suggest that the prohibitin gene is an analogue of Cc, a Drosophila melanogaster gene that is vital for normal development [[cite:PUB00080924]].</p>\n\n<p>Genes that negatively regulate proliferation inside the cell are of considerable interest because of the implications in processes such as development and cancer [[cite:PUB00003666]]. Prohibitin acts as a cytoplasmic anti-proliferative protein, is widely expressed in a variety of tissues and inhibits DNA synthesis. Studies have suggested that prohibitin may be a suppressor gene and is associated with tumour development and/or progression of at least some breast cancers [[cite:PUB00000784]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6iqe", "name" "Human prohibitin 2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036013", "name" "Band 7/SPFH domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03401" "Prohibitin family; SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) superfamily"}, "panther" {"PTHR23222" "PROHIBITIN"}, "prints" {"PR00679" "PROHIBITIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prohibitin", "short" "Prohibitin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4281, "taxa" 20295, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24235, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23979, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14533}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000163", :literature {"PUB00000784" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sato T" "Saito H" "Swensen J" "Olifant A" "Wood C" "Danner D" "Sakamoto T" "Takita K" "Kasumi F" "Miki Y."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/52/6/1643", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "The human prohibitin gene located on chromosome 17q21 is mutated in sporadic breast cancer.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "1643-6", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1540973}, "PUB00080174" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19-20", "authors" ["Langhorst MF" "Reuter A" "Stuermer CA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
