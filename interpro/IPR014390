{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents an acid phosphatase, Aspergillus type. Acid phosphatase is an enzyme with wide specificity that catalyses the reaction:<reaction>A phosphate monoester + H(2)O = an alcohol + phosphate</reaction></p>\r\n<p>It also catalyses transphosphorylations and is competitively inhibited by phosphomycin and inorganic orthophosphate. The Emericella nidulans (Aspergillus nidulans) palC4 mutant has substantially increased acid phosphatase activity when grown on solid minimal medium under phosphate starvation at pH 6.5. The secretion of this enzyme is not necessary to regenerate inorganic phosphate from the organic phosphate pool present in yeast extract [[cite:PUB00043439]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000900" "Acid phosphatase, Aspergillus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acid phosphatase, Aspergillus type", "short" "Acid_Pase_Asper"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 220, "taxa" 585, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 429, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 286}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
