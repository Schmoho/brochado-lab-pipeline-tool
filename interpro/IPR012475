{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lectins are involved in many recognition events at the molecular or cellular level. These fungal lectins, such as Aleuria aurantialectin (AAL, [swissprot:P18891]), specifically recognise fucosylated glycans. AAL is a dimeric protein, with each monomer being organised into a six-bladed β-propeller fold and a small antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet. The β-propeller fold is important in fucose recognition; five binding pockets are found between the propeller blades. The small β-sheet, on the other hand, is involved in the dimerisation process [[cite:PUB00016599]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4agi", "name" "Crystal Structure of Fucose binding lectin from Aspergillus Fumigatus (AFL) in complex with seleno fucoside."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07938" "Fungal fucose-specific lectin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fucose-specific lectin", "short" "Fungal_lectin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 86, "domain_architectures" 49, "proteomes" 401, "taxa" 1318, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1120, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1080, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 660}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012475", :literature {"PUB00016599" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Wimmerova M" "Mitchell E" "Sanchez JF" "Gautier C" "Imberty A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
