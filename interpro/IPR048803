{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from tailed bacteriophages and prophages from firmicutes, including Chaperone protein gp12 from Lactococcus phage p2 (also known as ORF12), which is thought to be a chaperone for the tape measure protein that might help to maintain the tape measure protein in solution during tail assembly. This late-expressed protein shows an all-α structure with five α-helices oriented to form a hydrophobic cleft on the inner surface of the protein. It adopts a trimeric assembly, forming long spirals [[cite:PUB00051292]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043077", "name" "Chaperone protein gp12 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20962" "Lactococcus lactis phage p2, ORF12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperone protein gp12", "short" "Gp12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 360, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 230, "sets" 0, "proteins" 230, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048803", :literature {"PUB00051292" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Siponen M" "Sciara G" "Villion M" "Spinelli S" "Lichiere J" "Cambillau C" "Moineau S" "Campanacci V."], "ISO_journal" "J.
