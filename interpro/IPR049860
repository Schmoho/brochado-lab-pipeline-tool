{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Holdfast attachment protein D (HfaD, [swissprot:Q45977]) from Caulobacter vibrioides and related proteins from alphaproteobacteria. HfaD is involved in attachment of the holdfast to the cell. The holdfast is a structure that allows the bacteria to firmly adheres to surfaces. The holdfast biosynthesis and secretion machinery are encoded by two major loci, hfsEFGH and hfsDABC. The hfsDAB genes encode a secretion protein complex believed to span the inner and outer membrane of the cell envelope. Deletion of any of the components of this complex results in holdfast shedding and decreased adherence and biofilm formation [[cite:PUB00105470]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF037936" "holdfast anchor protein HfaD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holdfast anchor protein HfaD", "short" "Holdfast_HfaD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 52, "taxa" 219, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 198, "sets" 0, "proteins" 198, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 160}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049860", :literature {"PUB00105470" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Sulkowski NI" "Hardy GG" "Brun YV" "Bharat TAM."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "A Multiprotein Complex Anchors Adhesive Holdfast at the Outer Membrane of Caulobacter crescentus.
