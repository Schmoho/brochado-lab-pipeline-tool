{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of cysteine peptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family C15 (pyroglutamyl peptidase I, clan CF). The type example being pyroglutamyl peptidase I of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. There are similarities in structure between members of clan CF and members of three clans of metallopeptidases (MC, MF and MH) and all four are included in the same superfamily (phosphorylase/hydrolase-like fold) by the SCOP database.  Members of clan CF have an α/β/α sandwich fold [[cite:PUB00076955]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pyroglutamyl peptidase I (also known as pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase, Pcp or PYRase) is an exopeptidase that hydrolytically removes the pGlu from pGlu-peptides or pGlu-proteins [[cite:PUB00004992], [cite:PUB00001639]]. PYRase has been found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes where at least two different classes have been characterised: the first containing bacterial and animal type I PYRases, and the second containing animal type II and serum PYRases. Type I and bacterial PYRases are soluble enzymes, while type II PYRases are membrane-bound. The primary application of PYRase has been its utilisation for protein or peptide sequencing, and bacterial diagnosis [[cite:PUB00001639]]. The conserved residues Cys-144 and His-168 have been identified by inhibition and mutagenesis studies [[cite:PUB00004992], [cite:PUB00002244]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family consist of bacterial and archaeal type I PYRases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1iu8", "name" "The X-ray Crystal Structure of Pyrrolidone-Carboxylate Peptidase from Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036440", "name" "Peptidase C15, pyroglutamyl peptidase I-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00417" "Pyrrolidone-carboxylate peptidase [pcp]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00504" "pyroglutamyl-peptidase I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyroglutamyl peptidase I, bacterial-type", "short" "PGP-I_bact-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1215, "taxa" 5735, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5348, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5348, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3912}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
