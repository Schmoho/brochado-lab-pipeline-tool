{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the theta subunit of DNA polymerase III from bacteria, whose core structure consists of an irregular array of three helices [[cite:PUB00013186]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNA polymerase III (Pol III) is the primary enzyme responsible for replication of Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA. The holoenzyme consists of 17 proteins and contains two core polymerases. The Pol III catalytic core has three tightly associated subunits: alpha, epsilon and theta. The alpha subunit is responsible for the DNA polymerase activity, while the epsilon subunit is the 3'-5' proofreading exonuclease. The epsilon subunit binds to both the alpha and theta subunits in the linear order α-ε-theta. The theta subunit is the smallest, and may act to enhance the proofreading activity of epsilon, especially under extreme conditions [[cite:PUB00035668]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036745", "name" "DNA polymerase III-theta superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06440" "DNA polymerase III, theta subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase III-theta, bacterial", "short" "DNA_pol_III_theta_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 154, "taxa" 1337, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1880, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1879, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1379}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0263", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0263"} {"accession" "GenProp1155", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1155"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
