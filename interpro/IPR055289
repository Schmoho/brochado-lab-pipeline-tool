{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins, which includes centriole and centriolar satellite protein OFD1, is involved in the structural integrity and functional regulation of centrioles, which are critical for cell division and signaling. Members of this family play a key role in determining the length of mother and daughter centrioles and are essential for the biogenesis of cilia, cellular projections that play a significant role in signal transduction for development and tissue maintenance [[cite:PUB00155307]]. These proteins are also implicated in the regulation of Wnt signalling pathways and the determination of the left-right axis during embryonic development [[cite:PUB00155305]]. Additionally, they participate in the recruitment of important ciliary proteins such as IFT88 and CEP164 to the centrioles [[cite:PUB00155306]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39063" "ORAL-FACIAL-DIGITAL SYNDROME 1 PROTEIN HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Centriole and centriolar satellite OFD1", "short" "OFD1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 819, "taxa" 3129, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1838, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1838, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1125}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055289", :literature {"PUB00155307" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Senatore E" "Chiuso F" "Rinaldi L" "Intartaglia D" "Delle Donne R" "Pedone E" "Catalanotti B" "Pirone L" "Fiorillo B" "Moraca F" "Giamundo G" "Scala G" "Raffeiner A" "Torres-Quesada O" "Stefan E" "Kwiatkowski M" "van Pijkeren A" "Morleo M" "Franco B" "Garbi C" "Conte I" "Feliciello A."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020106503", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The TBC1D31/praja2 complex controls primary ciliogenesis through PKA-directed OFD1 ubiquitylation.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "e106503", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33934390}, "PUB00155305" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Corbit KC" "Shyer AE" "Dowdle WE" "Gaulden J" "Singla V" "Chen MH" "Chuang PT" "Reiter JF."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb1670", "medline_journal" "Nat Cell Biol", "title" "Kif3a constrains beta-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling through dual ciliary and non-ciliary mechanisms.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "70-6", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18084282}, "PUB00155306" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Singla V" "Romaguera-Ros M" "Garcia-Verdugo JM" "Reiter JF."], "ISO_journal" "Dev Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2009.12.022", "medline_journal" "Dev Cell", "title" "Ofd1, a human disease gene, regulates the length and distal structure of centrioles.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "410-24", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20230748}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055289", "name" "Centriole and centriolar satellite OFD1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
