{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant receptor-like kinases, including Wall-associated receptor kinases (WAKs) and ZRKs. ZRKs may be pseudokinases [[cite:PUB00098446]]. ZRK3 is required for RPP13L4/ZAR1 recognition of the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector (T3E) HopF2a [[cite:PUB00098445]]. ZED1 works with RPP13L4/ZAR1 and is involved in the ambient temperature-sensitive aerial organ development [[cite:PUB00098447]] and in the plant immune system [[cite:PUB00098446]]. The WAKs are wall-associated kinases that bind to pectin and regulate cell expansion or stress responses [[cite:PUB00098449]]. Some WAKs may mediate resistance to diseases caused by biotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogens in several plant species [[cite:PUB00098450]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR27005" "WALL-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE-LIKE 21"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor-like kinase WAK-like", "short" "WAK-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 248, "taxa" 1019, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17186, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17186, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10520}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
