{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry, previously known as DUF6977, represents DarT1-associated NADAR antitoxin and related proteins. The DarT-NADAR system is a TA system catalysing the specific and reversible ADP-ribosylation of guanosine bases in which DarT1-associated NADARs reverse guanine ADP-ribosylation catalysed by DarT1. DarT1-associated NADAR antitoxin adopts an α/β globular structure characterised by an α-helical core that forms the active site flanked by two small β-sheet regions, comprising two and three strands [[cite:PUB00154386]]. Its structural core is globally similar to the structure of E.coli protein YbiA, a member of the NADAR domain family ([interpro:IPR012816]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22397" "DarT1-associated NADAR antitoxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DarT1-associated NADAR antitoxin", "short" "NADAR-DarT1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 109, "taxa" 1061, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 567, "sets" 0, "proteins" 563, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 448}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053913", :literature {"PUB00154386" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Schuller M" "Raggiaschi R" "Mikolcevic P" "Rack JGM" "Ariza A" "Zhang Y" "Ledermann R" "Tang C" "Mikoc A" "Ahel I."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.06.013", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Molecular basis for the reversible ADP-ribosylation of guanosine bases.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "2303-2315.e6", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37390817}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053913", "name" "DarT1-associated NADAR antitoxin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 73, "alignment:full" 110}}}
