{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of eukaryotic proteins found in animals, plants, and yeasts that includes Atg7p (YHR171W) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) and ATG7 from Pichia angusta. Members are about 650 to 700 residues in length and include a central domain of about 150 residues shared with the ThiF/MoeB/HesA family of proteins. A low level of similarity to ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 is described in a paper on peroxisome autophagy mediated by ATG7 [[cite:PUB00066530]], and is the basis of the name ubiquitin activating enzyme E1-like protein. Members of the family are involved in protein lipidation events analogous to ubiquitination and required for membrane fusion events during autophagy.</p>\n\n<p>This protein is important for several processes. It plays a key role in the maintenance of axonal homeostasis, the prevention of axonal degeneration [[cite:PUB00095362]], the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells [[cite:PUB00095361]], the formation of Paneth cell granules [[cite22291845]], as well as in adipose differentiation [[cite:PUB00095363]]. It is involved in circadian clock regulation in the liver and glucose metabolism through the autophagic degradation of CRY1 (clock repressor) in a time-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00095360]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01381" "E1-like protein-activating enzyme Gsa7p/Apg7p"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme Atg7", "short" "Atg7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1960, "taxa" 6789, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3619, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3618, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2176}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006285", :literature {"PUB00095360" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Toledo M" "Batista-Gonzalez A" "Merheb E" "Aoun ML" "Tarabra E" "Feng D" "Sarparanta J" "Merlo P" "Botre F" "Schwartz GJ" "Pessin JE" "Singh R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Metab.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Metab", "title" "Autophagy Regulates the Liver Clock and Glucose Metabolism by Degrading CRY1.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "268-281.e4", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29937374}, "PUB00095362" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Komatsu M" "Wang QJ" "Holstein GR" "Friedrich VL Jr" "Iwata J" "Kominami E" "Chait BT" "Tanaka K" "Yue Z."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
