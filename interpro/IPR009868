{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several VirE2 proteins which seem to be specific to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhizobium etli. VirE2 is known to interact, via its C terminus, with VirD4. A. tumefaciens transfers oncogenic DNA and effector proteins to plant cells during the course of infection. Substrate translocation across the bacterial cell envelope is mediated by a type IV secretion (TFS) system composed of the VirB proteins, as well as VirD4, a member of a large family of inner membrane proteins implicated in the coupling of DNA transfer intermediates to the secretion machine. VirE2 is therefore thought to be a protein substrate of a type IV secretion system which is recruited to a member of the coupling protein superfamily [[cite:PUB00013053]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07229" "VirE2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "VirE2", "short" "VirE2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 50, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 51, "sets" 0, "proteins" 51, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 40}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009868", :literature {"PUB00013053" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Atmakuri K" "Ding Z" "Christie PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
