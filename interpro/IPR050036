{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes metal-staphylopine import system permease protein CntB (also Known as Opp1B) which is part of the ABC transporter complex CntABCDF (Opp1) involved in the uptake of metal in complex with the metallophore staphylopine (StP). This proteinn is involved in the import of divalent metals ions such as nickel, cobalt and zinc. It is probably responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the membrane [[cite:PUB00094621], [cite:PUB00093059]]. It plays a major role in nickel/cobalt import in zinc-depleted conditions. CntB also contributes to virulence. It is required for full urease activity in vitro [[cite:PUB00094621]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035906", "name" "MetI-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045469" "nickel/cobalt ABC transporter permease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metal-staphylopine import system permease protein CntB", "short" "CntB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 167, "taxa" 876, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 603, "sets" 0, "proteins" 603, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 479}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR050036", :literature {"PUB00093059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Song L" "Zhang Y" "Chen W" "Gu T" "Zhang SY" "Ji Q."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
