The O-superfamily of conotoxins consists of 3 groups of Conus peptides that belong to the same structural group. These 3 groups differ in their pharmacological properties: the w-conotoxins which inhibit calcium channels, the delta-conotoxins which slow down the inactivation rate of voltage -sensitive sodium channels and the muO-conotoxins block the voltage sensitive sodium currents [[cite:PUB00016595]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08087" "Conotoxin O-superfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conotoxin O-superfamily", "short" "Toxin_18"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 134, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 88, "sets" 0, "proteins" 88, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012623", :literature {"PUB00016595" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["McIntosh JM" "Hasson A" "Spira ME" "Gray WR" "Li W" "Marsh M" "Hillyard DR" "Olivera BM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
