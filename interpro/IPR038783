{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is composed of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Sty1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Hog1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and similar fungal proteins. Sty1 and Hog1 are stress-activated MAPKs that participate in transcriptional regulation in response to stress [[cite:PUB00100226]].</p>\n\n<p>Sty1 is activated in response to oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and UV radiation [[cite:PUB00088413], [cite:PUB00088414]]. It is regulated by the MAP2K Wis1, which is activated by the MAP3Ks Wis4 and Win1, which receive signals of the stress condition from membrane-spanning histidine kinases Mak1-3 [[cite:PUB00088410]]. Activated Sty1 stabilizes the Atf1 transcription factor and induces transcription of Atf1-dependent genes of the core environmental stress response [[cite:PUB00088411], [cite:PUB00088412]].</p>\n\n<p>Hog1 is the key element in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway and is activated upon hyperosmotic stress. Activated Hog1 accumulates in the nucleus and regulates stress-induced transcription [[cite:PUB00088415]]. The HOG pathway is mediated by two transmembrane osmosensors, Sln1 and Sho1 [[cite:PUB00085486]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07856" "Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine Kinases, Fungal Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Sty1 and Hog1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fungal mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Sty1/Hog1", "short" "MAPK_Sty1/Hog1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 972, "taxa" 2734, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1435, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 909}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
