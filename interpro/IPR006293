{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ATP-dependent DNA helicase RecQ ([ec:3.6.4.12]) is involved in genome maintenance [[cite:PUB00009985]]. All homologues tested to date unwind paired DNA, translocating in a 3' to 5' direction and several have a preference for forked or 4-way DNA structures (e.g. Holliday junctions) or for G-quartet DNA. The yeast protein, Sgs1, is present in numerous foci that coincide with sites of<i>de novo</i>synthesis DNA, such as the replication fork, and protein levels peak during S-phase.</p>\n\n<p>A model has been proposed for Sgs1p action in the S-phase checkpoint response, both as a 'sensor' for damage during replication and a 'resolvase' for structures that arise at paused forks, such as the four-way 'chickenfoot' structure. The action of Sgs1p may serve to maintain the proper amount and integrity of ss DNA that is necessary for the binding of RPA (replication protein A, the eukaryotic ss DNA-binding protein)-DNA pol complexes. Sgs1p would thus function by detecting (or resolving) aberrant DNA structures, and would thus contribute to the full activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Mec1p and the effector kinase, Rad53p. Its ability to bind both the large subunit of RPA and the RecA-like protein Rad51p, place it in a unique position to resolve inappropriate fork structures that can occur when either the leading or lagging strand synthesis is stalled. Thus, RecQ helicases integrate checkpoint activation and checkpoint response.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1oyw", "name" "Structure of the RecQ Catalytic Core"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01389" "DNA helicase RecQ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA helicase, ATP-dependent, RecQ type, bacterial", "short" "DNA_helicase_ATP-dep_RecQ_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6236, "taxa" 22909, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24666, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24666, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18915}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0491", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0491"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
