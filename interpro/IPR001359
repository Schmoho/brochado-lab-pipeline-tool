{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The synapsins are a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins that coat synaptic vesicles and are involved in the binding between these vesicles and the cytoskeleton (including actin filaments). The family comprises 5 homologous proteins Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb and III. Synapsins I, II, and III are encoded by 3 different genes. The a and b isoforms of synapsin I and II are splice variants of the primary transcripts [[cite:PUB00018754]].</p>\n\n<p>Synapsin I is mainly associated with regulation of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neuron terminals [[cite:PUB00053858]]. Synapsin II, as well as being involved in neurotransmitter release, has a role in the synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity responsible for long term potentiation [[cite:PUB00018755]]. Recent studies implicate synapsin III with a developmental role in neurite elongation and synapse formation that is distinct from the functions of synapsins I and II [[cite:PUB00053859]].</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, synapsins are multidomain proteins, of which 3 domains are common to all the mammalian forms. The N-terminal `A' domain is ~30 residues long and contains a serine residue that serves as an acceptor site for protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation. This is followed by the `B' linker domain, which is ~80 residues long and is relatively poorly conserved. Domain `C' is the longest, spanning approximately 300 residues. This domain is highly conserved across all the synapsins (including those from Drosophila) and is possessed by all splice variants. The remaining six domains, D-I, are not shared by all the synapsins and differ both between the primary transcripts and the splice variants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016185", "name" "Pre-ATP-grasp domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01368" "SYNAPSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Synapsin", "short" "Synapsin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 956, "taxa" 3828, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20173, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4263, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2736}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00345", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00345"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001359", :literature {"PUB00018755" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6531", "authors" ["Rosahl TW" "Spillane D" "Missler M" "Herz J" "Selig DK" "Wolff JR" "Hammer RE" "Malenka RC" "Sudhof TC."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/375488a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Essential functions of synapsins I and II in synaptic vesicle regulation.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "488-93", "volume" "375", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7777057}, "PUB00018754" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Nomura M" "Ueta Y" "Serino R" "Yamamoto Y" "Shibuya I" "Yamashita H."], "ISO_journal" "Neurosci.
