{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The structure of one member of the ABATE domain family consists of a two-domain organisation, with the N-terminal domain presenting a new fold called the ABATE domain that may bind an as yet unknown ligand. The C-terminal domain forms a treble-clef zinc-finger that is likely to be involved in DNA binding. suggests a role as stress-induced transcriptional regulator. Further computational analyses sugeests a role as a stress-induced transcriptional regulator [[cite:PUB00054176]].
