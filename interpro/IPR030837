{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of radical SAM proteins mainly found in Clostridia, including the BzaD, also known as Putative variant cofactor biosynthesis B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain protein 1 (BzaD) from Eubacterium limosum [[cite:PUB00086657]]. Members of this protein family are one of two tandem B12-binding domain/radical SAM domain proteins that occur in a genome context with a pair of homologues to ThiC (phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase, [ec:4.1.99.17]), an enzyme that performs a complex rearrangement involved in thiamin biosynthesis, and a putative CobT (nicotinate-nucleotide--dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase), an enzyme of cobalamin biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04385" "B12 lower ligand biosynthesis radical SAM protein BzaD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "B12 lower ligand biosynthesis radical SAM protein BzaD-like", "short" "BzaD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 71, "sets" 0, "proteins" 71, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 61}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030837", :literature {"PUB00086657" {"URL" nil, "issue" "34", "authors" ["Hazra AB" "Han AW" "Mehta AP" "Mok KC" "Osadchiy V" "Begley TP" "Taga ME."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
