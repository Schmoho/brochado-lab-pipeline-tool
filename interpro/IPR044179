{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins, including PPR5 from maize and rice and At2g30780/At4g39620/At2g48000/At3g06430 from Arabidopsis. PPR5 is a chloroplastic protein that binds to single-stranded RNA and influences both RNA stability and splicing [[cite:PUB00095457]]. It has been shown to stabilise the chloroplast trnG pre-RNA by directly binding to a group II intron, where it protects an endonuclease-sensitive site and stimulates splicing [[cite:PUB00095459]]. At4g39620 is involved in embryo morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00095458]]. At3g06430, also known as PPR2 and EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2750 (EMB2750), binds to plastid 23S rRNA and plays an important role in the first mitotic division during gametogenesis and in cell proliferation during embryogenesis [[cite:PUB00101392]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47874" "EXPRESSED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein PPR5-like", "short" "PPR5-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 272, "taxa" 1199, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2480, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2480, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1472}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044179", :literature {"PUB00095459" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Beick S" "Schmitz-Linneweber C" "Williams-Carrier R" "Jensen B" "Barkan A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
