{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Ah (dioxin) receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors and is required for Ah receptor function. The Ah receptor binds, and mediates the carcinogenic effects of a variety of environmental pollutants, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Arnt is a structural component of the XRE-binding form of the Ah receptor. These proteins are class VII members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. The bHLH domain may be responsible for interacting with both the XRE and the ligand-binding subunit [[cite:PUB00003697], [cite:PUB00005150]].<p>The activated Ah receptor and Arnt protein bind DNA as a heterodimer. Both proteins contain PAS homology regions, which in Drosophila PER and SIM proteins function as dimerisation domains [[cite:PUB00003697]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035965", "name" "PAS domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036638", "name" "Helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00785" "NCTRNSLOCATR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear translocator", "short" "Nuc_translocat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1024, "taxa" 4616, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 91408, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15822, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9771}, "pathways" 53}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
