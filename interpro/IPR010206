These enzymes sequentially add adenosine nucleotides to the 3' end of RNAs, targeting them for degradation by the cell [[cite:PUB00013821], [cite:PUB00013755]]. This was originally described for anti-sense RNAs, but was later demonstrated for mRNAs as well [[cite:PUB00013805]]. Members of this family are predominantly found in the gamma- and beta-proteobacteria, with putative members in the Chlamydiacae and Spirochetes.
