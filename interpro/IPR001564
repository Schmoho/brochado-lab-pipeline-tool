{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nucleoside diphosphate kinases ([ec:2.7.4.6]) (NDK) are enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) other than ATP. They provide NTPs for nucleic acid synthesis, CTP for lipid synthesis, UTP for polysaccharide synthesis and GTP for protein elongation, signal transduction and microtubule polymerisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NDK are proteins of 17 Kd that act via a ping-pong mechanism in which a histidine residue is phosphorylated, by transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP. In the presence of magnesium, the phosphoenzyme can transfer its phosphate group to any NDP, to produce an NTP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NDK isozymes have been sequenced from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources. It has also been shown [[cite:PUB00000847]] that the Drosophila awd (abnormal wing discs) protein, is a microtubule-associated NDK. Mammalian NDK is also known as metastasis inhibition factor nm23. The sequence of NDK has been highly conserved through evolution. There is a single histidine residue conserved in all known NDK isozymes, which is involved in the catalytic mechanism [[cite:PUB00002696]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wkj", "name" "Crystal Structure of Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036850", "name" "Nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00451" "Nucleoside diphosphate kinase [ndk]"}, "prints" {"PR01243" "NUCDPKINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleoside diphosphate kinase", "short" "Nucleoside_diP_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 202, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10988, "taxa" 44185, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 90565, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53961, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39452}, "pathways" 68}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00409", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00409"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1262", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1262"} {"accession" "GenProp1484", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1484"} {"accession" "GenProp1621", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1621"} {"accession" "GenProp1227", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1227"} {"accession" "GenProp1634", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1634"} {"accession" "GenProp1607", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1607"} {"accession" "GenProp1494", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1494"} {"accession" "GenProp1446", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1446"} {"accession" "GenProp1755", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1755"} {"accession" "GenProp1650", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1650"} {"accession" "GenProp1617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1617"} {"accession" "GenProp1586", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1586"} {"accession" "GenProp1343", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1343"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
