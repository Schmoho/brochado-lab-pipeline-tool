{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of TonB-dependent outer-membrane receptors which are found mainly in Xanthomonas and Caulobacter.  These appear to represent the expansion of a paralogous family in that the 22 Xanthomonas axonopodis (21 in Xanthomonas campestris) and 18 Caulobacter crescentus (Caulobacter vibrioides) sequences are more closely related to each other than any of the many TonB-dependent receptors found in other species.  In fact, the C. crescentus and Xanthomonas sequences are inseparable on a phylogenetic tree using a PAM-weighted neighbour-joining method, indicating that one of the two genuses may have acquired this set of receptors from the other.  The mechanism by which this family is shared between Xanthomonas, a gammaproteobacterial plant pathogen and Caulobacter, an alpha proteobacterial aquatic organism is unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036942", "name" "TonB-dependent receptor-like, beta-barrel domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01782" "TonB-dependent receptor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterial TonB-dependent receptor", "short" "TonB_rcpt_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1197, "taxa" 4784, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20981, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20981, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16463}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010104", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010104", "name" "Bacterial TonB-dependent receptor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
