{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The complete DNA sequence of the genome of Vaccinia virus has been determined [[cite:PUB00008084]]. 198 \"major\" protein-coding regions and 65 overlapping \"minor\" regions have been identified, with a total of 263 potential genes. The genes are compactly organised along the genome, with few noncoding regions [[cite:PUB00008084]]. The function of the majority of proteins encoded by these open reading frames is so far undetermined.</p>\n\n<p>The DNA sequence of the Fowlpox virus genome corresponding to the vaccinia virus D6-A1 region has been deduced [[cite:PUB00008085]]. Translation of the sequence reveals fowlpox virus gene homologues corresponding to the D6, D7, D9, D10, D11, D12, D13 and A1 genes of vaccinia virus. Insertion of a gene cartridge comprising the vaccinia virus p7.5 promoter and the lacZ gene into the fowlpox virus D8, D9 and D10 genes was carried out <i>in vitro</i>, followed by recombination into fowlpox virus [[cite:PUB00008085]]. No stable insertion mutants were obtained for D10, suggesting that this gene probably encodes a function essential to virus replication [[cite:PUB00008085]].</p>\n\n<p>D10 (also known as mRNA-decapping protein OPG122), like the D9 protein, contains an evolutionarily conserved MutT domain core, which is a characteristic of the NUDIX hydrolase family [[cite:PUB00006662]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01364" "VD10PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vaccinia virus D10, decapping enzyme", "short" "Vaccinia_D10_decapping"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 780, "sets" 0, "proteins" 139, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 35}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
