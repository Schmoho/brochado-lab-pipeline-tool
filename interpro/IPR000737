{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The squash inhibitors form one of a number of serine proteinase inhibitor families. They belong to MEROPS inhibitor family I7, clan IE. They are generally annotated as either trypsin or elastase inhibitors (MEROPS peptidase family S1, [interpro:IPR001254]). The proteins, found exclusively in the seeds of the cucurbitaceae, e.g. Citrullus lanatus (watermelon), Cucumis sativus (cucumber), Momordica charantia (balsam pear), are approximately 30 residues in length and contain 6 Cys residues, which form 3 disulphide bonds [[cite:PUB00001564]]. The inhibitors function by being taken up by a serine protease (such as trypsin), which cleaves the peptide bond between Arg/Lys and Ile residues in the N-terminal portion of the protein [[cite:PUB00000373], [cite:PUB00001564]]. Structural studies have shown that the inhibitor has an ellipsoidal shape, and is largely composed of Î²-turns [[cite:PUB00001564]]. The fold and Cys connectivity of the proteins resembles that of potato carboxypeptidase A inhibitor [[cite:PUB00000373]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1lu0", "name" "Atomic Resolution Structure of Squash Trypsin Inhibitor: Unexpected Metal Coordination"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011052", "name" "Proteinase/amylase inhibitor domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00150" "PlantTI"}, "prosite" {"PS00286" "Squash family of serine protease inhibitors signature"}, "prints" {"PR00293" "SQUASHINHBTR"}, "pfam" {"PF00299" "Squash family serine protease inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteinase inhibitor I7, squash", "short" "Prot_inh_squash"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 9, "taxa" 189, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 125, "sets" 0, "proteins" 76, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 67}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00258", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00258"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000737", :literature {"PUB00000373" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Krishnamoorthi R" "Gong YX" "Lin CL" "VanderVelde D."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00118a036", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Two-dimensional NMR studies of squash family inhibitors.
