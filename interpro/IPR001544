Surprisingly, the best conserved region does not include the lysine residue to which the pyridoxal-phosphate group is known to be attached, in ilvE, but is located some 40 residues at the C terminus side of the pyridoxal-phosphate-lysine. The D-amino acid transferases (D-AAT), which are among the members of this entry, are required by bacteria to catalyse the synthesis of D-glutamic acid and D-alanine, which are essential constituents of bacterial cell wall and are the building block for other D-amino acids. Despite the difference in the structure of the substrates, D-AATs and L-ATTs have strong similarity [[cite:PUB00000425], [cite:PUB00002360]].</p>\n\n<p>Bifunctional aminodeoxychorismate lyase / D-amino acid transaminase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (also referred to as Rv0812) is a \nbifunctional enzyme that catalyses two enzymatic reactions in biochemically unrelated pathways: acts as an aminodeoxychorismate (ADC) lyase (ADCL) in folate biosynthesis, converting 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) to 4-aminobenzoate (PABA), and as a D-amino acid transaminase (DAAT) in peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00151494]].</p>\n\n<p>This group also includes transaminase htyB from <i>Aspergillus rugulosus</i>, which is one of the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the antifungal agent echinocandin B.  HtyB catalyses the production of L-homotyrosine from the intermediate 2-oxo-4-(4-hydroxybenzyl)butanoic acid [[cite:PUB00088724]]. Also included in this group is branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase gloG from the yeast <i>Glarea lozoyensis</i>, which is required for biosynthesis of the mycotoxin pneumocandin, also a lipohexapeptide of the echinocandin family [[cite:PUB00089640]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1i2k", "name" "AMINODEOXYCHORISMATE LYASE FROM ESCHERICHIA COLI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043132", "name" "Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase-like, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043131", "name" "Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase-like, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036038", "name" "Aminotransferase-like, PLP-dependent enzymes", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01063" "Amino-transferase class IV"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aminotransferase class IV", "short" "Aminotrans_IV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 155, "domain_architectures" 344, "proteomes" 11713, "taxa" 44837, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 117551, "sets" 0, "proteins" 117368, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 87298}, "pathways" 70}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00618", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00618"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1334", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1334"} {"accession" "GenProp1467", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1467"} {"accession" "GenProp1727", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1727"} {"accession" "GenProp1328", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1328"} {"accession" "GenProp1667", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1667"} {"accession" "GenProp1673", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1673"} {"accession" "GenProp1708", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1708"} {"accession" "GenProp1332", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1332"} {"accession" "GenProp1533", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1533"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
