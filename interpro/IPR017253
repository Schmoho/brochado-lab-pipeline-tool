{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the testis-determining factor Sry (Sex-determining Region Y). Sry is a transcriptional activator that regulates a genetic switch in male development. It is necessary and sufficient for initiating male sex determination by directing the development of supporting cell precursors (pre-Sertoli cells) as Sertoli rather than granulosa cells [[cite:PUB00042789]]. Sry is involved in different aspects of gene regulation including promoter activation or repression and contains a high-mobility-group (HMG) box that recognises DNA by partial intercalation in the minor groove [[cite:PUB00042790]]. It binds to the DNA consensus sequence 5'-[AT]AACAA[AT]-3'. Sry also facilitates DNA bending and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. It is also involved in maintenance of motor functions of dopaminergic neurons in the male adult brain. Sry interacts with a number of partners, including CALM, EP300 (modulates Sry DNA-binding activity), HDAC3, KPNB1, ZNF208 isoform KRAB-O, PARP1 (impaired Sry DNA-binding activity), SLC9A3R2 and WT1. The C-terminal nuclear localization signal in Sry HMG-box domain mediates nuclear import through importin beta 1 [[cite:PUB00042791]].</p>\n\n<p>Defects in Sry can cause gonadal dysgenesis XY female type (GDXY) [OMIM:306100], which is also known as 'XY females' or Swyer syndrome [[cite:PUB00042792]]. Patients suffer rapid and early degeneration of their gonads, which prevents the development secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. Defects in Sry are also found Turner's Syndrome, a disease characterised by gonadal dysgenesis in a 45,X female type [[cite:PUB00042793]]. Defects in Sry can also cause true hermaphroditism [OMIM:235600], genetically heterogeneous condition where patients have both mature ovarian and mature testicular tissue (46,XX, 46,XY or a mosaic of 46,XX/46,XY) [[cite:PUB00042794]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037653" "Sex-determining region Y protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor SRY", "short" "SRY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 649, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 559, "sets" 0, "proteins" 558, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 522}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017253", :literature {"PUB00042789" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Anson BJ" "Harper DG" "Winch TR."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Arch Otolaryngol", "title" "The vestibular system.
