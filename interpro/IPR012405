{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are stand-alone forms of the LytTR DNA-binding domain [[cite:PUB00009981]]. One of them is BlpS from Streptococcus pneumoniae. BlpS is encoded together with the components of the two-component system Blp, which also contains another LytTR-containing protein, the response regulator BlpR [[cite:PUB00015819]]. The Blp system is closely related to quorum-sensing systems regulating cell density-dependent phenotypes, such as the development of genetic competence or the production of antimicrobial peptides in lactic acid bacteria, and is a peptide-sensing system that controls the<i>blp</i>regulon. The<i>blp</i>regulon is composed of genes for regulation, synthesis, export, and processing of Blps (bacteriocin-like peptides) [[cite:PUB00015819]]. The exact function of BlpS is not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF033143" "Stand-alone DNA-binding LytTR domain protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LytTR stand-alone protein", "short" "LyTR_stand-alone"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012405", :literature {"PUB00009981" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Nikolskaya AN" "Galperin MY."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/30.11.2453", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "A novel type of conserved DNA-binding domain in the transcriptional regulators of the AlgR/AgrA/LytR family.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "2453-9", "volume" "30", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12034833}, "PUB00015819" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["de Saizieu A" "Gardes C" "Flint N" "Wagner C" "Kamber M" "Mitchell TJ" "Keck W" "Amrein KE" "Lange R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
