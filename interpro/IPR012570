{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the leucine operon leader peptide. The leucine operon is involved in the control of the biosynthesis of leucine. Four adjacent leucine codons within the leucine leader RNA are critically important in transcription attenuation-mediated control of leucine operon expression in bacteria. The leader RNA contains translational start and stop signals, a cluster of four leucine codons and overlapping regions of dyad symmetry that are capable of forming stem-and-loop structures [[cite:PUB00016465]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08054" "Leucine operon leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leucine operon leader peptide", "short" "Leu_leader"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 21, "taxa" 522, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 500, "sets" 0, "proteins" 500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 385}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012570", :literature {"PUB00016465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Carter PW" "Weiss DL" "Weith HL" "Calvo JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
