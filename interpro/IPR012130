{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are photoactive yellow protein, a cytosolic, 14kDa light-sensing protein which has a 4-hydroxycinnamyl (p-coumaric acid) chromophore covalently linked to a Cys residue. The enzyme 4-coumarate--CoA ligase as described by [interpro:IPR012743] is required for its biosynthesis. The modified Cys is in a PAS domain, frequently found in signal transducing proteins. Members are known in alpha and gammaproteobacteria that include Rhodobacter capsulatus (Rhodopseudomonas capsulata), Halorhodospira halophila (Ectothiorhodospira halophila), Rhodospirillum centenum (Rhodocista centenaria), etc.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1nwz", "name" "PYP Ultra-high resolution structure of a Bacterial Photoreceptor"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035965", "name" "PAS domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000087" "Photoactive yellow protein"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02373" "photoactive yellow protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photoactive yellow-protein", "short" "PYP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 103, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 116, "taxa" 668, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 359, "sets" 0, "proteins" 359, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 273}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012130", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009881", "name" "photoreceptor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007602", "name" "phototransduction", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012130", "name" "Photoactive yellow-protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
