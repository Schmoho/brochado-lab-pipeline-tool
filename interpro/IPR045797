{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Evasins are secreted glycoproteins from ticks, that enhance host blood flow and have anti-inflammatory activity. They bind to chemokines and prevent leukocyte recruitment [[cite:PUB00099019], [cite:PUB00099020], [cite:PUB00099017], [cite:PUB00099018]]. Based on the chemokine selectivity they can be divided in two classes: Class A binds CC chemokines and includes Evasin-1 (EVA-1) and Evasin-4, being EVA-1 more selective; Class B Evasins include Evasin-3 which binds and inhibits several CXC chemokines but not CC chemokines.</p>\n\n<p>This family represents class A evasins, which contain eight conserved Cys residues that define four intramolecular disulfide bonds. The N- and C-terminal regions are flexible, extend from either side of the core and form a concave surface with the first Î²-sheet suitable for binding another EVA-1 molecule or to a chemokine. There are two Gly residues strictly conserved. Predicted glycosylation sites were identified on the exterior surface of the structure. Due to its anti-inflammatory activity, these proteins are interesting therapeutic agents [[cite:PUB00099017], [cite:PUB00099018]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7s4n", "name" "Crystal structure of the tick evasin EVA-P974 complexed to human chemokine CCL17"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19429" "Evasins Class A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Evasins Class A", "short" "EVA_Class_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 45, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 463, "sets" 0, "proteins" 463, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 434}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045797", :literature {"PUB00099018" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Deruaz M" "Frauenschuh A" "Alessandri AL" "Dias JM" "Coelho FM" "Russo RC" "Ferreira BR" "Graham GJ" "Shaw JP" "Wells TN" "Teixeira MM" "Power CA" "Proudfoot AE."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Med", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Med", "title" "Ticks produce highly selective chemokine binding proteins with antiinflammatory activity.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "2019-31", "volume" "205", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18678732}, "PUB00099017" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Bhusal RP" "Eaton JRO" "Chowdhury ST" "Power CA" "Proudfoot AEI" "Stone MJ" "Bhattacharya S."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Trends Biochem Sci", "title" "Evasins: Tick Salivary Proteins that Inhibit Mammalian Chemokines.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "108-122", "volume" "45", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31679840}, "PUB00099020" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Deruaz M" "Bonvin P" "Severin IC" "Johnson Z" "Krohn S" "Power CA" "Proudfoot AE."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Evasin-4, a tick-derived chemokine-binding protein with broad selectivity can be modified for use in preclinical disease models.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "4876-87", "volume" "280", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23910450}, "PUB00099019" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Bonvin P" "Dunn SM" "Rousseau F" "Dyer DP" "Shaw J" "Power CA" "Handel TM" "Proudfoot AEI."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Identification of the pharmacophore of the CC chemokine-binding proteins Evasin-1 and -4 using phage display.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "31846-31855", "volume" "289", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25266725}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019957", "name" "C-C chemokine binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:1900137", "name" "negative regulation of chemokine activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045797", "name" "Evasins Class A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
