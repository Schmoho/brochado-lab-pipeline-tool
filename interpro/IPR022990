{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Ribosome rescue factor SmrB from Escherichia coli and related proteins mainly from gammaproteobacteria. SmrB acts as a ribosome collision sensor [[cite:PUB00155447]]. It detects stalled/collided disomes (pairs of ribosomes where the leading ribosome is stalled and a second ribosome has collided with it) and cleaves mRNA at the 5' end of the stalled ribosome. The cleaved mRNA becomes available for tmRNA ligation, leading to ribosomal subunit dissociation and rescue of stalled ribosomes [[cite:PUB00155447]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036063", "name" "Smr domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01042" "UPF0115 protein YfcN [yfcN]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome rescue factor SmrB", "short" "SmrB-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 218, "taxa" 1773, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1716, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1716, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1332}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022990", :literature {"PUB00155447" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7901", "authors" ["Saito K" "Kratzat H" "Campbell A" "Buschauer R" "Burroughs AM" "Berninghausen O" "Aravind L" "Green R" "Beckmann R" "Buskirk AR."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04416-7", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Ribosome collisions induce mRNA cleavage and ribosome rescue in bacteria.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "503-508", "volume" "603", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35264790}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022990", "name" "Ribosome rescue factor SmrB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
