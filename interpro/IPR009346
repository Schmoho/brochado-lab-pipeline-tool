{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality 19 (GRIM-19) proteins. GRIM-19, was reported to encode a small protein primarily distributed in the nucleus and was able to promote cell death induced by IFN-beta and RA. A bovine homologue of GRIM-19 was co-purified with mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) in bovine heart. Therefore, its exact cellular localisation and function are unclear. It has now been discovered that GRIM-19 is a specific interacting protein which negatively regulates Stat3 activity [[cite:PUB00012289]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06212" "GRIM-19 protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR12966" "NADH DEHYDROGENASE UBIQUINONE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX SUBUNIT 13"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GRIM-19", "short" "GRIM-19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 267, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 2293, "taxa" 7928, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3727, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3658, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2386}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1230", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1230"} {"accession" "GenProp1637", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1637"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009346", :literature {"PUB00012289" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lufei C" "Ma J" "Huang G" "Zhang T" "Novotny-Diermayr V" "Ong CT" "Cao X."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdg135", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "GRIM-19, a death-regulatory gene product, suppresses Stat3 activity via functional interaction.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1325-35", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12628925}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009346", "name" "GRIM-19", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 28, "alignment:full" 2169}}}
