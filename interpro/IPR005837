{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This model describes bacterial flagellar biogenesis protein fliP, which is one of the genes within the motility locus on the bacterial chromosome that is involved in structure and function of bacterial flagellum. It was demonstrated that mutants in fliP locus were non-flagellated and non-motile, while revertants were flagellated and motile. In Escherichia coli and related proteins the fliP protein probably [[cite:PUB00002241]] plays a role in the transport of flagellar proteins. FliP is a protein of about 30 Kd which contains three or four transmembrane regions. Proteins evolutionary related to fliP have been found in a wide range of bacteria (mopC, hrcR, hrpW, spaP, yscR, etc.) and are involved in a variety of signal-peptide independent secretion systems.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01103" "flagellar type III secretion system pore protein FliP"}, "prints" {"PR00951" "FLGBIOSNFLIP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar transport protein FliP", "short" "FliP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4438, "taxa" 17349, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19222, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14930}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0879", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0879"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005837", :literature {"PUB00002241" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Malakooti J" "Ely B" "Matsumura P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
