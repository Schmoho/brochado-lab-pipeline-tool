{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The plant Polyol transporter (PLT) subfamily includes PLT1-6 from Arabidopsis thaliana and similar transporters [[cite:PUB00097060]]. The best characterised member of the group is Polyol transporter 5, also called Sugar-proton symporter PLT5, which mediates the H-symport of numerous substrates including linear polyols (such as sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol or glycerol), cyclic polyol myo-inositol, and different hexoses, pentoses (including ribose), tetroses, and sugar alcohols. It functions to transport a wide range of substrates into specific sink tissues in the plant [[cite:PUB00097059], [cite:PUB00097057]]. The PLT subfamily belongs to the Glucose transporter-like (GLUT-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement [[cite:PUB00097058]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17437" "Plant Polyol transporter family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyol transporter 1-6", "short" "PLT1-6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 202, "taxa" 799, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 954, "sets" 0, "proteins" 950, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 601}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044776", :literature {"PUB00097058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yan N."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Trends Biochem Sci", "title" "Structural advances for the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "151-9", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23403214}, "PUB00097059" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Klepek YS" "Geiger D" "Stadler R" "Klebl F" "Landouar-Arsivaud L" "Lemoine R" "Hedrich R" "Sauer N."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Arabidopsis POLYOL TRANSPORTER5, a new member of the monosaccharide transporter-like superfamily, mediates H+-Symport of numerous substrates, including myo-inositol, glycerol, and ribose.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "204-18", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15598803}, "PUB00097057" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Reinders A" "Panshyshyn JA" "Ward JM."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Analysis of transport activity of Arabidopsis sugar alcohol permease homolog AtPLT5.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1594-602", "volume" "280", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15525644}, "PUB00097060" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Johnson DA" "Hill JP" "Thomas MA."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Evol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Evol Biol", "title" "The monosaccharide transporter gene family in land plants is ancient and shows differential subfamily expression and expansion across lineages.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "64", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16923188}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005351", "name" "carbohydrate:proton symporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005828", "name" "Major facilitator, sugar transporter-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003663", "name" "Sugar/inositol transporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044775", "name" "Sugar transporter ERD6/Tret1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045262", "name" "Sugar transport protein STP/Polyol transporter PLT, plant", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044776", "name" "Polyol transporter 1-6", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044778", "name" "Sugar transport protein STP/MST-like, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR045263", "name" "Glucose transporter GLUT", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR002439", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 1 (GLUT1)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002440", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 2 (GLUT2)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002441", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 4 (GLUT4)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002442", "name" "Fructose transporter, type 5 (GLUT5)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002945", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 3 (GLUT3)", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR047984", "name" "D-xylose-proton symporter-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR004736", "name" "MFS transporter, metabolite:H symporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004738", "name" "Phosphate permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004749", "name" "Organic cation transport protein/SVOP", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR045915", "name" "Solute carrier family 22 members 4/5", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
