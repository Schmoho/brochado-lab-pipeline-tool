{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>VapB is the antitoxin of a bacterial toxin-antitoxin gene pair. The cognate toxin is VapC ([interpro:IPR007712]). The family contains several related antitoxins from Cyanobacteria and Actinobacterial families. Antitoxins of this class carry an N-terminal ribbon-helix-helix domain, RHH, that is highly conserved across all type II bacterial antitoxins, which dimerises with the RHH domain of a second VapB molecule. A hinge section follows the RHH, with an additional pair of flexible Î± helices at the C terminus. This C terminus is the Toxin-binding region of the dimer, and so is specific to the cognate toxin, whereas the RHH domain has the specific function of lying across the RNA-binding groove of the toxin dimer and inactivating the active-site - a more general function of all antitoxins [[cite:PUB00056596], [cite:PUB00067485]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6a7v", "name" "Crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapBC11 toxin-antitoxin complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09957" "Bacterial antitoxin of type II TA system, VapB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterial antitoxin of type II TA system, VapB", "short" "VapB_antitoxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 1353, "taxa" 6779, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9204, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9204, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6798}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019239", :literature {"PUB00056596" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Pandey DP" "Gerdes K."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki201", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "966-76", "volume" "33", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15718296}, "PUB00067485" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Ramage HR" "Connolly LE" "Cox JS."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000767", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "Comprehensive functional analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis toxin-antitoxin systems: implications for pathogenesis, stress responses, and evolution.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e1000767", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20011113}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR019239", "name" "Bacterial antitoxin of type II TA system, VapB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 24, "alignment:full" 2038}}}
