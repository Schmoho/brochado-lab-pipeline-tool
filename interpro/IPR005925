{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family include known and predicted examples of agmatinase (agmatine ureohydrolase, [ec:3.5.3.11]) and members of archaea, for which no definitive agmatinase sequence has yet been made available [[cite:PUB00017651]]. However, archaeal sequences are phylogenetically close to the experimentally verified Bacillus subtilis sequence. One species of Halobacterium has been demonstrated in vitro to produce agmatine from arginine, but no putrescine from ornithine, suggesting that arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase, rather than arginase and ornithine decarboxylase, lead from arginine to polyamine biosynthesis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7lol", "name" "The structure of Agmatinase from E.
