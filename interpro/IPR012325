{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Assassin bugs  (Arthropoda:Insecta:Hemiptera:Reduviidae), sometimes known as conenose or kissing bugs, are one of the largest and morphologically diverse families of true bugs feeding on crickets, caterpillars and other insects. Some assassin bug species are bloodsucking parasites of mammals, even of human. They can be commonly found throughout most of the world and their size varies from a few millimetres to as much as 3 or 4 centimetres. The toxic saliva of the predatory assassin bugs contains a complex mixture of small and large peptides for diverse uses such as immobilising and pre-digesting their prey, and defence against competitors and predators. Assassin bug toxins are small peptides with disulfide connectivity that target ion-channels. They are relatively homologous to the calcium channel blockers omega-conotoxins from marine cone snails and belong to the four-loop cysteine scaffold structural class [[cite:PUB00016615]], [[cite:PUB00016409]].</p>\n\n<p>One of these small proteins, Ptu1, blocks reversibly the N-type calcium channels, but at the same time is less specific for the L-or P/Q-type calcium channels [[cite:PUB00016615]]. Ptu1 is 34 amino acid residues long and is cross-linked by three disulphide bridges. Ptu1 contains a β-sheet region made of two antiparallel β-strands and consists of a compact disulphide-bonded core from which four loops emerge as well as N-and C-termini [[cite:PUB00016409]].
