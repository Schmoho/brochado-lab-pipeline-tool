{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Defective chloroplasts and leaves protein (DCL), first identified in tomato, is a small protein that plays a role in the early stage of chloroplast development and palisade cell morphogenesis [cite:PUB00096756], [cite:PUB00096756]]. It is required for correct plastid ribosome assembly and for processing and maturation of 4.5S rRNA [[cite:PUB00096757]]. This entry includes DCL from Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) and its orthologue from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00096758]]. Also included in this entry is the Protein EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 514 (also known as DOMINO1) from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis and in a process essential for nuclear and nucleolar functions. It shares high sequence similarities with DCL proteins [[cite:PUB00096759]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33415" "PROTEIN EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 514"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein DCL-like", "short" "DCL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 362, "taxa" 1889, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2336, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2336, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1469}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044673", :literature {"PUB00096758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bellaoui M" "Gruissem W."], "ISO_journal" "Planta", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Planta", "title" "Altered expression of the Arabidopsis ortholog of DCL affects normal plant development.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "819-26", "volume" "219", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15197595}, "PUB00096759" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lahmy S" "Guilleminot J" "Cheng CM" "Bechtold N" "Albert S" "Pelletier G" "Delseny M" "Devic M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "DOMINO1, a member of a small plant-specific gene family, encodes a protein essential for nuclear and nucleolar functions.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "809-20", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15341625}, "PUB00096756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Keddie JS" "Carroll B" "Jones JD" "Gruissem W."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "The DCL gene of tomato is required for chloroplast development and palisade cell morphogenesis in leaves.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "4208-17", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8861949}, "PUB00096757" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bellaoui M" "Keddie JS" "Gruissem W."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "DCL is a plant-specific protein required for plastid ribosomal RNA processing and embryo development.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "531-43", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15010617}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044673", "name" "Protein DCL-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
