{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the secreted glycosylated protein U9-ORF from Mus musculus and similar sequences from vertebrates. U9-ORF is a 118-residues protein encoded by U90926, a long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that has been associated with the proliferation of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in retinal photoreceptor cells [[cite:PUB00154315], [cite:PUB00154316]]. U9-ORF is secreted by activated myeloid cells. Its expression has been associated with protection during endotoxic shock and with the proliferation of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in murine retinal photoreceptor cells [[cite:PUB00154317]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22040" "Secreted glycosylated protein U9-ORF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secreted glycosylated protein U9-ORF", "short" "U9-ORF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 61, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054417", :literature {"PUB00154315" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shirahama S" "Onoguchi-Mizutani R" "Kawata K" "Taniue K" "Miki A" "Kato A" "Kawaguchi Y" "Tanaka R" "Kaburaki T" "Kawashima H" "Urade Y" "Aihara M" "Akimitsu N."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76450-2", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Long noncoding RNA U90926 is crucial for herpes simplex virus type 1 proliferation in murine retinal photoreceptor cells.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "19406", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33173149}, "PUB00154316" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shirahama S" "Taniue K" "Mitsutomi S" "Tanaka R" "Kaburaki T" "Sato T" "Takeuchi M" "Kawashima H" "Urade Y" "Aihara M" "Akimitsu N."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91340-x", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Human U90926 orthologous long non-coding RNA as a novel biomarker for visual prognosis in herpes simplex virus type-1 induced acute retinal necrosis.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "12164", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34108530}, "PUB00154317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sabikunnahar B" "Caldwell S" "Varnum S" "Hogan T" "Cooper A" "Lahue KG" "Bivona JJ" "Cousens PM" "Symeonides M" "Ballif BA" "Poynter ME" "Krementsov DN."], "ISO_journal" "J Immunol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2200215", "medline_journal" "J Immunol", "title" "Long Noncoding RNA U90926 Is Induced in Activated Macrophages, Is Protective in Endotoxic Shock, and Encodes a Novel Secreted Protein.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "807-819", "volume" "210", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36705532}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054417", "name" "Secreted glycosylated protein U9-ORF", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 4}}}
