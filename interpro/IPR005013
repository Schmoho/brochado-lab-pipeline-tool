{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are involved in asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. In particular, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (DDOST), also known as oligosaccharyltransferase ([ec:2.4.99.18]), transfers the high-mannose sugar GlcNAc(2)-Man(9)-Glc(3) from a dolichol-linked donor to an asparagine acceptor in a consensus Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif. In most eukaryotes, the DDOST complex is composed of three subunits, which in humans are described as a 48kDa subunit, ribophorin I, and ribophorin II [[cite:PUB00075630]]. However, the yeast DDOST appears to consist of six subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta). The yeast beta subunit is a 45kDa polypeptide, previously discovered as the Wbp1 protein, with known sequence similarity to the human 48kDa subunit and the other orthologues. This family includes the 48kDa-like subunits from several eukaryotes; it also includes the yeast DDOST beta subunit Wbp1.</p>\n\n<p>Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit Wbp1 is the beta subunit of the OST complex, one of the original six subunits purified [[cite:PUB00054186]]. Wbp1 is essential [[cite:PUB00054187], [cite:PUB00054188]], but conditional mutants have decreased transferase activity [[cite:PUB00054188], [cite:PUB00054189]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10830" "DOLICHYL-DIPHOSPHOOLIGOSACCHARIDE--PROTEIN GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 48 KDA SUBUNIT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase 48kDa subunit", "short" "DDOST_48_kDa_subunit"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2543, "taxa" 10284, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5679, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5679, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3275}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005013", :literature {"PUB00054189" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["te Heesen S" "Knauer R" "Lehle L" "Aebi M."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Yeast Wbp1p and Swp1p form a protein complex essential for oligosaccharyl transferase activity.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "279-84", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8428586}, "PUB00075630" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Babaiants RS" "Konstantinov AV" "Potekaev NS" "Ivanov OL."], "ISO_journal" "Vestn Dermatol Venerol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Vestn Dermatol Venerol", "title" "[Side effects and complications in the external use of corticosteroids in dermatologic practice]", "year" 1976, "raw_pages" "13-7", "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 936767}, "PUB00054187" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["te Heesen S" "Rauhut R" "Aebersold R" "Abelson J" "Aebi M" "Clark MW."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
