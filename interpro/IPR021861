{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>THO complex subunit 1 (THOC1; its homologues from plants and yeast HPR1) is a component of the THO subcomplex of the TREX complex, which is involved in coupling mRNA transcription, processing and nuclear export, and specifically associates with spliced mRNA and not with unspliced pre-mRNA. TREX plays central roles during mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein) maturation and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00100461]]. The THO complex is recruited to transcribed genes and moves along the gene with the elongating polymerase during transcription. THO is important for stabilizing nascent RNA in the RNA polymerase II elongation complex by preventing formation of DNA:RNA hybrids behind the elongating polymerase [[cite:PUB00100461], [cite:PUB00100460], [cite:PUB00063152]]. In plants, HPR1 plays a role in disease resistance [[cite:PUB00100462]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11957" "THO complex subunit 1 transcription elongation factor"}, "panther" {"PTHR13265" "THO COMPLEX SUBUNIT 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "THO complex, subunit THOC1", "short" "THO_THOC1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 73, "proteomes" 2513, "taxa" 8458, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5315, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5092, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3185}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021861", :literature {"PUB00063152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Huertas P" "Aguilera A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
