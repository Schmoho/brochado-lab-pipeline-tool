{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A three-gene cassette encoding ImuA, ImuB, and ImuC (referring to inducible mutagenesis) is induced by DNA damage, is capable of DNA synthesis across DNA damage lesions, and consequently is associated with mutagenesis. This family represents ImuA (previously misnamed SulA in Pseudomonas putida) which shows some homology to SulA itself and to RecA. ImuB resembles Y-family polymerases but may be catalytically inactive. ImuC is a C-family polymerase, and catalytically active [[cite:PUB00105094], [cite:PUB00105095]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033429" "translesion DNA synthesis-associated protein ImuA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Translesion DNA synthesis-associated protein ImuA", "short" "ImuA_translesion"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 783, "taxa" 3482, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4239, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4239, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3181}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047610", :literature {"PUB00105095" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ippoliti PJ" "Delateur NA" "Jones KM" "Beuning PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cells", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cells", "title" "Multiple strategies for translesion synthesis in bacteria.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "799-831", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24710531}, "PUB00105094" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Abella M" "Erill I" "Jara M" "Mazon G" "Campoy S" "Barbe J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Widespread distribution of a lexA-regulated DNA damage-inducible multiple gene cassette in the Proteobacteria phylum.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "212-22", "volume" "54", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15458417}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047610", "name" "Translesion DNA synthesis-associated protein ImuA", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017166", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP037290", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
