{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family are the alternative oxidases found in many bacteria which oxidise ubiquinol and reduce oxygen as part of the electron transport chain. This family is the subunit I of the oxidase. E. coli has two copies of the oxidase, bo and bd. Only bd is represented here In some nitrogen fixing bacteria.</p>\n\n<p>Cytochrome bd may play an important role in microaerobic nitrogen fixation in the enteric bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae, where it is expressed under all conditions that permit diazotrophy [[cite:PUB00003598]]. Subunit I binds a single b-haem, through ligands at His186 and Met393 (using [swissprot:P0ABJ9] numbering). In addition His19 is a ligand for the haem b found in subunit II ([interpro:IPR003317]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b4o", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of cytochrome bd oxidase from C. glutamicum"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30365" "CYTOCHROME D UBIQUINOL OXIDASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01654" "Cytochrome bd terminal oxidase subunit I"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006446" "Cytochrome quinol oxidase, subunit 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome ubiquinol oxidase subunit 1", "short" "Cyt-d_ubiquinol_oxidase_su_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 33, "proteomes" 6404, "taxa" 24687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36546, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35836, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27760}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0617"} {"accession" "GenProp1373", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1373"} {"accession" "GenProp1515", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1515"} {"accession" "GenProp1202", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1202"} {"accession" "GenProp1608", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1608"} {"accession" "GenProp1269", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1269"} {"accession" "GenProp1141", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1141"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
