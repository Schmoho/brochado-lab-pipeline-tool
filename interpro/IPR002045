{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Metallothioneins (MT) are small proteins that bind heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, etc. They have a high content of cysteine residues that bind the metal ions through clusters of thiolate bonds [[cite:PUB00003570], [cite:PUB00001490]]. An empirical classification into three classes has been proposed by Fowler and coworkers [[cite:PUB00005944]] and Kojima [[cite:PUB00003571]]. Members of class I are defined to include polypeptides related in the positions of their cysteines to equine MT-1B, and include mammalian MTs as well as from crustaceans and molluscs. Class II groups MTs from a variety of species, including sea urchins,\r\nfungi, insects and cyanobacteria. Class III MTs are atypical polypeptides composed of gamma-glutamylcysteinyl units [[cite:PUB00005944]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This original classification system has been found to be limited, in the sense that it does not allow clear differentiation of patterns of structural similarities, either between or within classes. Subsequently, a new classification was proposed on the basis of sequence similarity derived from phylogenetic relationships, which basically proposes an MT family for each main taxonomic group of organisms [[cite:PUB00078698]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Crustacean MTs belong to family 3. They are small proteins, with 18 totally conserved cysteines. The members of this family are recognised by the sequence pattern P-[GD]-P-C-C-x(3,4)-C-x-C located at the Nterm. The taxonomic range of the members extends to crustaceans. Known characteristics of this family are: 58 to 60 AAs; variants exist with and without the N-terminal Met. Protein sequence is divided into two structural domains, containing each 9 Cys binding 3 bivalent metal ions. Family 3 includes subfamilies: c1, c2, c. All sequences are very similar. c1 and c2 are forming two distinct monophyletic groups in the AA phylogenetic tree. c are crustacean MTs different from c1 and c2 based on phylogenetic analyses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017854", "name" "Metallothionein domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00858" "MTCRUSTACEAN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metallothionein, crustacean", "short" "Metalthion_crustacean"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 166, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 48}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002045", :literature {"PUB00001490" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kagi JH" "Kojima Y."], "ISO_journal" "Experientia Suppl.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Experientia Suppl", "title" "Chemistry and biochemistry of metallothionein.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "25-61", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2959513}, "PUB00005944" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Fowler BA" "Hildebrand CE" "Kojima Y" "Webb M."], "ISO_journal" "Experientia Suppl.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Experientia Suppl", "title" "Nomenclature of metallothionein.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "19-22", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2959504}, "PUB00078698" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Capdevila M" "Atrian S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
