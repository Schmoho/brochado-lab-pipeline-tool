{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) are multipass transmembrane proteins that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport substrates across membrane bilayers. Members of ABC transporter subfamily A are full-length transporters [[cite:PUB00072325]], which consist of a single long polypeptide chain organised into two tandemly arranged halves. Each half contains a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) followed by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD) [[cite:PUB00007914]]. Several members of this group have been shown to mediate the transport of a variety of physiologic lipid compounds, such as sterols, phospholipids and bile acids [[cite:PUB00087211], [cite:PUB00096698]].</p>\n\n<p>ABCA7 plays a role in clearance of apoptotic cells by affecting their phagocytosis [[cite:PUB00060002]]. In the human visual cycle, ABCA4 acts as an inward-directed retinoid flipase, retinoid substrates imported by ABCA4 from the extracellular or intradiscal (rod) membrane surfaces to the cytoplasmic membrane surface are all-trans-retinaldehyde (ATR) and N-retinyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (NR-PE). Once transported to the cytoplasmic surface, ATR is reduced to vitamin A by trans-retinol dehydrogenase (tRDH) and then transferred to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where it is converted to 11-cis-retinal. ABCA4 may also play a role in photoresponse, removing ATR/NR-PE from the extracellular photoreceptor surfaces during bleach recovery [[cite:PUB00060003]]. It has been suggested that ABCA9 plays a role in monocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis [[cite:PUB00060004]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR19229" "ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER SUBFAMILY A ABCA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter A", "short" "ABCA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2405, "taxa" 8889, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33460, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33460, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10137}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
