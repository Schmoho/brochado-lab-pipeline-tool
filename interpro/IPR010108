{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lycopene cyclases generate provitamin A carotenoids which are essential building blocks for cyclic xanthophylls involved in photosynthesis and regulatory networks. The cyclization of lycopene is the final step in carotenoid biosynthesis and may proceed via one of two pathways: the formation of a β-ring by beta-cyclase, or an ε-ring by epsilon-cyclase. Epsilon-cyclase adds only one ring, forming the monocyclic δ-carotene, whereas beta-cyclase introduces a ring at both ends of lycopene to form the bicyclic β-carotene [[cite:PUB00011586], [cite:PUB00106873], [cite:PUB00106874]]. Lycopene cyclases are widely distributed across taxonomic groups and have structural diversity. Four partly related families of lycopene cyclases are known: CrtY, CrtL (β-ionone end group producing), CrtL (η-ionone end group producing) and CrtL (capsanthin/capsorubin synthase).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family includes lycopene beta-and epsilon-cyclases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids in bacteria and plants, and the related capsanthin capsorubin synthase (Ccs) from plants, which converts antheraxanthin or violaxanthin into capsanthin or capsorubin by a mechanism similar to lycopene cyclization. This family also includes neoxanthin synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of neoxanthin, the last product of carotenoid synthesis and a precursor of abscisic acid [[cite:PUB00076703]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01790" "lycopene cyclase family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lycopene cyclase, beta/epsilon", "short" "Lycopene_cyclase_b/e"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 936, "taxa" 3781, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3665, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3651, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2632}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1451", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1451"} {"accession" "GenProp0758", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0758"} {"accession" "GenProp1763", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1763"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
