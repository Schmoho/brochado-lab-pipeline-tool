{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the PpnN protein from Escherichia coli ([swissprot:P0ADR8]) (also known as YgdH) and related proteins found mainly in gammaproteobacteria. PpnN (pyrimidine/purine nucleotide 5'-monophosphate nucleosidase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of diverse pyrimidine and purine nucleotide 5'-monophosphates, to form ribose 5-phosphate and the corresponding free base, and plays an essential role in purine homeostasis [[cite:PUB00084997]]. It can bind the the stringent response alarmones ppGpp and pppGpp and then, because of allosteric changes, have a much higher rate of cleavage of preferred substrate GMP [[cite:PUB00100958], [cite:PUB00105770]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3gh1", "name" "Crystal structure of predicted nucleotide-binding protein from Vibrio cholerae"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037153", "name" "Pyrimidine/purine nucleotide 5'-monophosphate nucleosidase PpnN-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038390" "nucleotide 5'-monophosphate nucleosidase PpnN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleotide 5'-monophosphate nucleosidase PpnN", "short" "PpnN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 870, "taxa" 4760, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4931, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4931, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3811}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
