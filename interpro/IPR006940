{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Securin, also known as pituitary tumour-transforming gene product is a regulatory protein which plays a central role in chromosome stability in the p53/TP53 pathway, and in DNA repair. It probably acts by blocking the action of key proteins, for example, during mitosis it blocks Separase/ESPL1 function preventing the proteolysis of the cohesin complex and the subsequent segregation of the chromosomes. At the onset of anaphase, it is ubiquitinated, leading to its destruction and to the liberation of ESPL1. Its function is however not limited to an inhibitory activity, since it is required to activate ESPL1. The negative regulation of the transcriptional activity and related apoptosis activity of TP53 may explain the strong transforming capability of the protein when it is overexpressed.  Over-expression of securin is associated with a number of tumours, and it has been proposed that this may be due to erroneous chromatid separation leading to chromosome gain or loss [[cite:PUB00008672]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10418" "SECURIN-3"}, "pfam" {"PF04856" "Securin sister-chromatid separation inhibitor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Securin sister-chromatid separation inhibitor", "short" "Securin_separation_inhibitor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 639, "taxa" 2242, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1066, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1050, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 779}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006940", :literature {"PUB00008672" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5426", "authors" ["Zou H" "McGarry TJ" "Bernal T" "Kirschner MW."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5426.418", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Identification of a vertebrate sister-chromatid separation inhibitor involved in transformation and tumorigenesis.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "418-22", "volume" "285", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10411507}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0051276", "name" "chromosome organization", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005737", "name" "cytoplasm", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006940", "name" "Securin sister-chromatid separation inhibitor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 717}}}
