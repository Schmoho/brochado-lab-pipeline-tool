{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytoplasmic proteins Nck are non-enzymatic adaptor proteins composed of three SH3 (Src homology 3) domains and a C-terminal SH2 domain [[cite:PUB00068630]]. They regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics by linking proline-rich effector molecules to protein tyrosine kinases and phosphorylated signaling intermediates [[cite:PUB00068632]]. They function downstream of the PDGFbeta receptor and are involved in Rho GTPase signaling and actin dynamics [[cite:PUB00085584]]. They associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors or their cellular substrates [[cite:PUB00042787], [cite:PUB00042788]]. There are two vertebrate Nck proteins, Nck1 and Nck2.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037874" "Cytoplasmic protein NCK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytoplasmic protein NCK", "short" "NCK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 758, "taxa" 2961, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1620, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1595, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1060}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017304", :literature {"PUB00042788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Tu Y" "Kucik DF" "Wu C."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(01)02195-0", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Identification and kinetic analysis of the interaction between Nck-2 and DOCK180.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "193-9", "volume" "491", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11240126}, "PUB00042787" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Matuoka K" "Miki H" "Takahashi K" "Takenawa T."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
