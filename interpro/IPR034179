{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>LCAD is an acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACAD), which is found in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and in some prokaryotes.  It catalyzes the alpha, beta dehydrogenation of the corresponding trans-enoyl-CoA by FAD, which becomes reduced. The reduced form of LCAD is reoxidized in the oxidative half-reaction by electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF), from which the electrons are transferred to the mitochondrial respiratory chain coupled with ATP synthesis.
