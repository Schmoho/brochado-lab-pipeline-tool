{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase from Synechococcus elongatus (ARR) and similar proteins from Cyanobacteria. ARR reduces a long-chain (mainly C16 or C18) fatty acyl ACP ester to its corresponding fatty aldehyde, releasing the acyl carrier protein (ACP) [[cite:PUB00055010]]. NADPH is the reductant for this reaction. Its structure shows the protein is composed of three domains, with the the mid-domain was designated as the dinucleotide recognition loop [[cite:PUB00100129]]. This enzyme may be distantly related to the short-chain dehydrogenase or reductase (SDR) family ([pfam:PF00106]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04058" "long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF026396" "Predicted short chain dehydrogenase, Alr5284 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase", "short" "AAR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 179, "taxa" 1124, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 677, "sets" 0, "proteins" 677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 492}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0942", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0942"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
