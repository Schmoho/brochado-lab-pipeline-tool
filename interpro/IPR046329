{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents SO4A1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1) and related proteins from chordates. Members of this protein family contain a Kazal domain and belongs to the Major facilitator superfamily.</p>\n\n<p>SO4A1 (also known as OATP4A1) is ubiquitously expressed and mediates the sodium ion-independent transport of the thyroid hormones T3 (triiodo-L-thyronine), T4 (thyroxine) and rT3, and other organic anions such as estrone sulfate and taurocholate. It is the most abundantly expressed transporter in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its role in the transport of estrone sulfate, which is used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), affects the outcome of the treatment [[cite:PUB00099495], [cite:PUB00099492], [cite:PUB00099494], [cite:PUB00099496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17462" "Solute carrier organic anion transporter 4A subfamily of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1-like", "short" "SO4A1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 369, "taxa" 1159, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 445, "sets" 0, "proteins" 445, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 338}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046329", :literature {"PUB00099492" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2 Pt B", "authors" ["Brenner S" "Klameth L" "Riha J" "Scholm M" "Hamilton G" "Bajna E" "Ausch C" "Reiner A" "Jager W" "Thalhammer T" "Buxhofer-Ausch V."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cancer Lett", "title" "Specific expression of OATPs in primary small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "517-24", "volume" "356", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25301452}, "PUB00099494" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Glaeser H" "Bujok K" "Schmidt I" "Fromm MF" "Mandery K."], "ISO_journal" "Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol", "title" "Organic anion transporting polypeptides and organic cation transporter 1 contribute to the cellular uptake of the flavonoid quercetin.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "883-91", "volume" "387", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24947867}, "PUB00099495" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Rawluszko-Wieczorek AA" "Horst N" "Horbacka K" "Bandura AS" "Swiderska M" "Krokowicz P" "Jagodzinski PP."], "ISO_journal" "Biomed Pharmacother", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biomed Pharmacother", "title" "Effect of DNA methylation profile on OATP3A1 and OATP4A1 transcript levels in colorectal cancer.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "233-42", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26349991}, "PUB00099496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Wlcek K" "Svoboda M" "Riha J" "Zakaria S" "Olszewski U" "Dvorak Z" "Sellner F" "Ellinger I" "Jager W" "Thalhammer T."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Biol Ther", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cancer Biol Ther", "title" "The analysis of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) mRNA and protein patterns in primary and metastatic liver cancer.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "801-11", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21383546}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008514", "name" "organic anion transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0015711", "name" "organic anion transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004156", "name" "Organic anion transporter polypeptide", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR046329", "name" "Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 4A1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
