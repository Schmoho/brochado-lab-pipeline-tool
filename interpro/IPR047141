{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of mono/polysaccharide phosphotransferases from animal, fungi and bacteria, including N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunits alpha/beta from humans (GNPTAB) and Capsular polysaccharide phosphotransferase WcwK from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Family members were first identified in microbes as proteins that help pathogens to elude the host innate immune system. Microbial stealth proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides [[cite:PUB00075655]]. GNPTAB catalyses the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) markers on high mannose type oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus. MP6 residues mediate the vesicular transport of lysosomal enzymes to the endosomal/prelysosomal compartment [[cite:PUB00090104], [cite:PUB00097530], [cite:PUB00102011]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes 3-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-alpha-D-mannopyranose xylosylphosphotransferase from Cryptococcus neoformans, which functions in the O-glycosylation of proteins en route through the secretory pathway [[cite:PUB00102012]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24045" "PTHR24045"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Stealth family", "short" "Stealth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2091, "taxa" 8575, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7538, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7538, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5206}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
