{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes archaeal probable exosome complex RNA-binding protein 1, exosome complex component RRP40 and RRP4. They are subunits of either archaeal or eukaryotic exosome complex. Exosome is a complex of 3' --> 5' exoribonucleases that play a major role in diverse RNA processing and degradation pathways.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The eukaryotic exosome complex contains 9 proteins. Six RNase PH domain containing proteins (Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46, and Mtr3) form a catalytic ring, three RNA binding domain containing proteins (Rrp4,Rrp40, and Csl4) bind on top of the ring [[cite:PUB00035569]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the archaeal exosome, the hexameric ring is formed by three dimers of the orthologs of Rrp41 and Rrp42 and degrades poly(A) RNA phosphorolytically. Three proteins with RNA binding domains (orthologues of Rrp4 or Csl4) bind to the ring and influences degradation of a short poly(A) RNA substrate by the hexameric ring [[cite:PUB00035570], [cite:PUB00061680]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2je6", "name" "Structure of a 9-subunit archaeal exosome"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21321" "PNAS-3 RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosome complex RNA-binding protein 1/RRP40/RRP4", "short" "Exosome_RNA_bind1/RRP40/RRP4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 35, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2847, "taxa" 10701, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11069, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11069, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7708}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
