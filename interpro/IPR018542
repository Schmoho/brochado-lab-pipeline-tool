{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of proteins found in SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses. It includes Protein 9b from SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Bat coronaviruses.</p>\n\n<p>Protein 9b is one of 8 accessory proteins in SARS-CoV [[cite:PUB00094102]]. The gene (ORF 9b, also known as ORF13) that encodes this protein is included within the nucleocapsid (N) gene (alternative ORF) [[cite:PUB00094111]]. Data suggest that protein 9b is a structural component of SARS-CoV virions and functions as an unusual lipid binding protein [[cite:PUB00094102], [cite:PUB00040066]].</p>\n\n<p>SARS-CoV ORF-9b has been shown to localise to the outer mitochondrial membrane and to target mitochondrial antiviral signalling proteins (MAVS), suppressing innate immunity [[cite:PUB00094092], [cite:PUB00094090], [cite:PUB00094091]]. Antibodies against SARS-CoV ORF-9b have been found in patients, demonstrating that it is produced during infection [[cite:PUB00040066], [cite:PUB00094110]].</p>\n\n<p>Protein 9b from SARS CoV comprises 98 amino acids. Its structure has a novel fold which forms a dimeric tent-like β structure with an amphipathic surface, and a central hydrophobic cavity that binds lipid molecules [[cite:PUB00040066]]. This cavity is likely to be involved in membrane attachment [[cite:PUB00040066]].</p>\n\n<p>Protein 9b is a group-specific protein of SARS coronavirus (CoV). The sequence of ORF-9b is well conserved in different SARS isolates, however, there is little homology between Protein 9b from SARS-CoV and the I protein (Protein 9b homologue) present in other coronaviruses [[cite:PUB00094111], [cite:PUB00040066], [cite:PUB00094103]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6z4u", "name" "X-ray Crystallographic Structure of Orf9b from SARS-CoV-2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037223", "name" "Protein 9b, SARS-CoV", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21955" "accessory protein 9b of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and similar proteins"}, "profile" {"PS51920" "Sarbecovirus 9b domain profile"}, "pfam" {"PF09399" "Betacoronavirus lipid binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein 9b, Betacoronavirus", "short" "Protein_9b_Betacoronavirus"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 79, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 70, "sets" 0, "proteins" 70, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018542", :literature {"PUB00040066" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Meier C" "Aricescu AR" "Assenberg R" "Aplin RT" "Gilbert RJ" "Grimes JM" "Stuart DI."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2006.05.012", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The crystal structure of ORF-9b, a lipid binding protein from the SARS coronavirus.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1157-65", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16843897}, "PUB00094091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Zhang L" "Qin Y" "Chen M."], "ISO_journal" "Autophagy", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Autophagy", "title" "Viral strategies for triggering and manipulating mitophagy.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1665-1673", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29895192}, "PUB00094092" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Shi CS" "Qi HY" "Boularan C" "Huang NN" "Abu-Asab M" "Shelhamer JH" "Kehrl JH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
