{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cyanophycin is an insoluble storage polymer for carbon, nitrogen, and energy, found in most Cyanobacteria. The polymer has a backbone of L-aspartic acid, with most Asp side chain carboxyl groups attached to L-arginine. The polymer is made by this enzyme, cyanophycin synthetase, and degraded by cyanophycinase. Heterologously expressed cyanophycin synthetase in Escherichia coli produces a closely related, water-soluble polymer with some Arg replaced by Lys. It is unclear whether enzymes that produce soluble cyanophycin-like polymers in vivo in non-Cyanobacterial species should be designated as cyanophycin synthetase itself or as a related enzyme. Cyanophycin synthesis is analogous to polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) biosynthesis, except that PHA polymers lack nitrogen and may be made under nitrogen-limiting conditions [[cite:PUB00015470]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02068" "cyanophycin synthetase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyanophycin synthetase", "short" "Cya_phycin_syn"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1368, "taxa" 5354, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6006, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6006, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4592}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0156", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0156"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
