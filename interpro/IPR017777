{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins associated with urea transport and metabolism. This family includes UrtA from Cyanobacteria, which is encoded in an operon typically found adjacent to urease genes. It was shown in that disruption leads to the loss of high-affinity urea transport activity [[cite:PUB00042949]]. It also includes the periplasmic component (FmdD) of an active transport system for short-chain amides and urea (FmdDEF), found in Methylophilus methylotrophus [[cite:PUB00080985]]. These proteins tend to have the twin-arginine signal for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7s6e", "name" "Crystal structure of UrtA from Synechococcus CC9311 in complex with urea and calcium"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06355" "periplasmic component (FmdD) of an active transport system for short-chain amides and urea (FmdDEF)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03407" "urea ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urea ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein UrtA-like", "short" "ABC_urea-bd_UrtA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2361, "taxa" 10006, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10605, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10604, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8261}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0743", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0743"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017777", :literature {"PUB00042949" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Valladares A" "Montesinos ML" "Herrero A" "Flores E."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
