{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). This BGC (BGC0001418) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic classes, NRP (non-ribosomal peptide) and polyketide. This family includes a protein from the myxochromide D biosynthetic gene cluster from Hyalangium minutum and appears to be predominantly found in Cystobacterineae [[cite:PUB00098945]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19542" "Family of unknown function (DUF6066)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6066", "short" "DUF6066"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 92, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 65, "sets" 0, "proteins" 65, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 54}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045710", :literature {"PUB00098945" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Burgard C" "Zaburannyi N" "Nadmid S" "Maier J" "Jenke-Kodama H" "Luxenburger E" "Bernauer HS" "Wenzel SC."], "ISO_journal" "ACS Chem Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "ACS Chem Biol", "title" "Genomics-Guided Exploitation of Lipopeptide Diversity in Myxobacteria.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "779-786", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28128551}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045710", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6066", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 13}}}
