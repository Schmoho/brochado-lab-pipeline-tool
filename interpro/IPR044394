The SARS-CoV ORF7b protein is a 44 amino acid protein which is homologous to an accessory but structural component of SARS-CoV virion. While ORF7b is packaged into virions, it is not required for the virus budding process, as gene 7 deletion viruses replicate efficiently in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ORF7b possesses a transmembrane helical domain (TMD), between 9-29 amino acid residues, is necessary for its Golgi complex localization, as replacing it with the TMD from the human endoprotease furin results in aberrant localization [[cite:PUB00094108], [cite:PUB00094109]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd21635" "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus structural accessory protein ORF7b and related proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Structural accessory protein ORF7b, SARS-CoV-like", "short" "ORF7b_SARS-CoV-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 105, "sets" 0, "proteins" 105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044394", :literature {"PUB00094108" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Schaecher SR" "Mackenzie JM" "Pekosz A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
