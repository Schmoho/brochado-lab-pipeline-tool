{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant transcription factors containing a Myc-type, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, including the transcription factors bHLH010, bHLH089, bHLH91 and bHLH138 from Arabidopsis thaliana and the transcription factors TIP2 and EAT1 from Oryza sativa.</p>\n\n<p>bHLH010, bHLH089 and bHLH91 are involved in pollen development. They are important for the development of the Arabidopsis anther, possibly by forming a feed-forward loop with DYT1 [[cite:PUB00099219], [cite:PUB00099220], [cite:PUB00099349]].</p>\n\n<p>TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2) is necessary in the meristemoid transition and differentiation during early anther development. TDR and EAT1 are paralogs of TIP2. TIP2 acts upstream of  TDR and EAT1 and regulates their expression [[cite:PUB00099350]].</p>\n\n<p>EAT1 participates in the regulation of tapetum programmed cell death (PCD) and degradation during male reproductive development in rice [[cite:PUB00099221], [cite:PUB00099222]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46834" "TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR BHLH91"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription factor bHLH91-like", "short" "bHLH91-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 237, "taxa" 920, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 968, "sets" 0, "proteins" 968, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 590}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045895", :literature {"PUB00099219" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Fu Y" "Li M" "Zhang S" "Yang Q" "Zhu E" "You C" "Qi J" "Ma H" "Chang F."], "ISO_journal" "J Genet Genomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Genet Genomics", "title" "Analyses of functional conservation and divergence revealÂ requirement of bHLH010/089/091 for pollen development at elevated temperature in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "477-492", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33393464}, "PUB00099220" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zhu E" "You C" "Wang S" "Cui J" "Niu B" "Wang Y" "Qi J" "Ma H" "Chang F."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The DYT1-interacting proteins bHLH010, bHLH089 and bHLH091 are redundantly required for Arabidopsis anther development and transcriptome.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "976-90", "volume" "83", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26216374}, "PUB00099221" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Ji C" "Li H" "Chen L" "Xie M" "Wang F" "Chen Y" "Liu YG."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Plant", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Plant", "title" "A novel rice bHLH transcription factor, DTD, acts coordinately with TDR in controlling tapetum function and pollen development.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1715-8", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23519457}, "PUB00099222" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Niu N" "Liang W" "Yang X" "Jin W" "Wilson ZA" "Hu J" "Zhang D."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1445", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23385589}, "PUB00099349" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Cui J" "You C" "Zhu E" "Huang Q" "Ma H" "Chang F."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Feedback Regulation of DYT1 by Interactions with Downstream bHLH Factors Promotes DYT1 Nuclear Localization and Anther Development.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1078-93", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27113773}, "PUB00099350" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Fu Z" "Yu J" "Cheng X" "Zong X" "Xu J" "Chen M" "Li Z" "Zhang D" "Liang W."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1512-1524", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24755456}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0048658", "name" "anther wall tapetum development", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045895", "name" "Transcription factor bHLH91-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
