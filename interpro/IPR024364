{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family are found in T4-like viruses. They have a single completely conserved residue S that may be functionally important. The family includes the two base plate proteins from bacteriophage T4: Gp51 and Gp26, encoded by late genes [[cite:PUB00056192]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gp26 is a structural component of central hub of the baseplate. It associates with Gp25 (tail lysozyme) in the assembly process. Gp51 is essential for the formation of the central hub of the phage baseplate, playing a catalytic role for the central hub formation. It is also a structural component of the hub [[cite:PUB00081409], [cite:PUB00081408]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12322" "T4 bacteriophage base plate protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baseplate hub assembly protein, bacteriophage T4-like", "short" "Baseplate_phage_T4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 428, "taxa" 3376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2998, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2995, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 840}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024364", :literature {"PUB00056192" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Scarlato V" "Storlazzi A" "Gargano S" "Cascino A."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(89)90617-X", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Bacteriophage T4 late gene expression: overlapping promoters direct divergent transcription of the base plate gene cluster.", "year" 1989, "raw_pages" "475-83", "volume" "171", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2763463}, "PUB00081409" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kozloff LM" "Lute M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
