{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two dehydratases, dihydroxy-acid dehydratase  (gene ilvD or ILV3) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (gene edd) have been shown to be evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00002191]]. Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase catalyzes the fourth step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine, the dehydration of 2,3-dihydroxy-isovaleic acid into alpha-ketoisovaleric acid. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydratase catalyzes the first step in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the dehydration of 6-phospho-D-gluconate into 6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate [[cite:PUB00101687]]. Another protein included in this entry is the Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhG.
