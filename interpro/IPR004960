{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial lipopolysachharides (LPS) are glycolipids that make up the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria. Though LPS molecules are variable, they all show the same general features: an outer polysaccharide which is attached to the lipid component, termed lipid A [[cite:PUB00033945]]. The polysaccharide component consists of a variable repeat-structure polysaccharide known as the O-antigen, and a highly conserved short core oligosaccharide which connects the O-antigen to lipid A. Lipid A is a glucosamine-based phospholipid that makes up the membrane anchor region of LPS [[cite:PUB00028103]]. The structure of lipid A is relatively invariant between species, presumably reflecting its fundamental role in membrane integrity. Recognition of lipid A by the innate immune system can lead to a response even at picomolar levels. In some genera, such as Neisseria and Haemophilus, lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are the predominant glycolipids [[cite:PUB00033946]]. These are analogous to LPS except that they lack O-antigens, with the LOS oligosaccharide structures limited to 10 saccharide units.</p>\n\n<p>The bacterial lipid A biosynthesis protein, or lipid A biosynthesis (KDO)2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA acyltransferase [ec:2.3.1], transfers myristate or laurate, activated on ACP, to the lipid IVA moiety of (KDO)2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA during lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00059307]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5knk", "name" "Lipid A secondary acyltransferase LpxM from Acinetobacter baumannii with catalytic residue substitution (E127A)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30606" "LIPID A BIOSYNTHESIS LAUROYL ACYLTRANSFERASE"}, "cdd" {"cd07984" "Lysophospholipid Acyltransferases (LPLATs) of Glycerophospholipid Biosynthesis: LABLAT-like"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF026649" "Lipid A biosynthesis lauroyl acyltransferase"}, "pfam" {"PF03279" "Bacterial lipid A biosynthesis acyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacterial lipid A biosynthesis acyltransferase", "short" "LipA_acyltrans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 75, "proteomes" 5943, "taxa" 23681, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50870, "sets" 0, "proteins" 50839, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38554}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1325", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1325"} {"accession" "GenProp1397", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1397"} {"accession" "GenProp1647", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1647"} {"accession" "GenProp0204", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0204"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
