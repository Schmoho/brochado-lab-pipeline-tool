{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Enterobacteriaceae indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase, part of a pathway for biosynthesis of the plant growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

It was suggested that the release of IAA benefits these bacteria by enabling them to modify their microhabitat, such as by increasing the rate of nutrient leakage from plant cells in their vicinity [[cite:PUB00060920]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03393" "indolepyruvate decarboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase, Enterobacteriaceae", "short" "IPDC_Enterobacteriaceae"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 126, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 142, "sets" 0, "proteins" 142, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 68}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
