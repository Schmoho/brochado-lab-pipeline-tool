{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This class of bacteriocins was previously described as class V. The members include gassericin A, acidocin B and butyrovibriocin AR10, all of which are hydrophobic cyclical structures [[cite:PUB00053269]]. The N- and C-termini are covalently linked, and the circular molecule is resistant to several proteases and peptidases [[cite:PUB00053270]]. The immunity protein that protects Lactobacillus gasseri from the toxic effects of its bacteriocin, gassericin A, has been identified. It is found to be a small positively-charged hydrophobic peptide of 53 amino acids containing a putative transmembrane segment [[cite:PUB00053271]] - a structure unlike that of the more common immunity proteins as found in [pfam:PF08951].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6wi6", "name" "Crystal structure of plantacyclin B21AG"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12173" "Bacteriocin class IIc cyclic gassericin A-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriocin class IIc", "short" "Bacteriocin_IIc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 49, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020970", :literature {"PUB00053269" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Leer RJ" "van der Vossen JM" "van Giezen M" "van Noort JM" "Pouwels PH."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Genetic analysis of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "1629-35", "volume" "141 ( Pt 7)", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7551031}, "PUB00053270" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Kawai Y" "Kemperman R" "Kok J" "Saito T."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
