{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes HemK (also known as PrmC) from Escherichia coli. HemK methylates the class 1 translation termination release factors RF1/PrfA and RF2/PrfB on the glutamine residue of the universally conserved GGQ motif [[cite:PUB00043100], [cite:PUB00039505]]. Its homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mtq1, is a methyltransferase that methylates MRF1 on 'Gln-287' using S-adenosyl L-methionine as methyl donor [[cite:PUB00063062]]. Homologues are found, usually in a single copy, in nearly all completed genomes, but varying somewhat in apparent domain architecture. Both Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae have two members rather than one. The members from the Mycoplasmas have an additional C-terminal domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00536" "HemK family protein methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyltransferase HemK-like", "short" "HemK-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10711, "taxa" 40954, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 56779, "sets" 0, "proteins" 56777, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42899}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0746", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0746"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
