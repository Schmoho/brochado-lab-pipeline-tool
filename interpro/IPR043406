{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes transmembrane glycoprotein EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule, also known as Trop-1) and Trop-2 (also known as tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2, TACSTD2). They belong to the tumour-associated calcium signal transducer (TACSTD) family. They have been reported to directly interact with claudin-1 and claudin-7 [[cite:PUB00093944], [cite:PUB00093943], [cite:PUB00093946]].</p>\n\n<p>EpCAM mediates homotypic cell contacts in epithelia tissues and regulates cell proliferation and cancer stemness. It has been used as a diagnostic marker for circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the blood [[cite:PUB00093942]]. EpCAM has been shown to contribute to formation of intestinal barrier by recruiting claudins to cell-cell junctions [[cite:PUB00093943]]. Mutations in the EpCAM gene lead to congenital tufting enteropathy, severe intestinal epithelium homeostasis disorders, and Lynch syndrome [[cite:PUB00093947]].</p>\n\n<p>Trop-2 is highly expressed in a variety of epithelial cancer cells. It has been identified as an oncogene leading to invasiveness and tumorigenesis [[cite:PUB00093945]]. It has been shown to regulate integrin-dependent signalling for cell-substrate adhesion and cell migration. It also modulates Rac1 GTPase activity and induces activation of PAK4 [[cite:PUB00093948]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4mzv", "name" "Crystal structure of extracellular part of human EpCAM"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14168" "TUMOR-ASSOCIATED CALCIUM SIGNAL TRANSDUCER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane glycoprotein EPCAM/Trop-2", "short" "EPCAM/Trop-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 636, "taxa" 2225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1561, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1089}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043406", :literature {"PUB00093943" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lei Z" "Maeda T" "Tamura A" "Nakamura T" "Yamazaki Y" "Shiratori H" "Yashiro K" "Tsukita S" "Hamada H."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
