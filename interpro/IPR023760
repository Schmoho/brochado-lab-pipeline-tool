{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CidA, which increases the activity of extracellular murein hydrolases possibly by mediating their export via hole formation. It is inhibited by the antiholin-like proteins LrgAB. In an unstressed cell, the LrgAB products probably inhibit the function of the CidAB proteins. When a cell is stressed by the addition of antibiotics or by other factors in the environment, the CidAB proteins possibly oligomerise within the bacterial cell membrane, creating lesions that disrupt the proton motive force, which in turn results in loss of cell viability. These lesions are also hypothesised to regulate the subsequent cell lysis by either allowing the murein hydrolases access to the cell wall substrate and/or regulating their activity by a possible change in the cell wall pH that results from loss of membrane potential [[cite:PUB00055101]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01143" "Holin-like protein CidA [cidA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holin-like protein CidA", "short" "Holin-like_CidA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 236, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 415, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 246}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023760", :literature {"PUB00055101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Rice KC" "Firek BA" "Nelson JB" "Yang SJ" "Patton TG" "Bayles KW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
