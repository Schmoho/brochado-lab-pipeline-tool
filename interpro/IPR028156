{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the replication protein A (RPA) interacting protein. RPA is a single stranded DNA-binding protein involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination [[cite:PUB00067593]]. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, RPA is transported into the nucleus mediated by RPA interacting protein [[cite:PUB00067594], [cite:PUB00067592]]. In humans, RPA interacting protein has several splice isoforms, including hRIPalpha, hRIPbeta, hRIPgamma, hRIPdelta1, hRIPdelta2, and hRIPdelta3. hRIPbeta transports RPA into the PML nuclear body and releases RPA upon UV irradiation [[cite:PUB00067592]]. It seems that the number of splice isoforms of RIPalpha is species-specific and has a tendency to increase in higher eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00067593]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31742" "RPA-INTERACTING PROTEIN RPAIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RPA-interacting protein", "short" "RIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1182, "taxa" 4687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2373, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1589}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028156", :literature {"PUB00067592" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Park J" "Seo T" "Kim H" "Choe J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
