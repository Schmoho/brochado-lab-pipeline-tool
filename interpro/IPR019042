{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Type II restriction endonucleases ([ec:3.1.21.4]) are components of prokaryotic DNA restriction-modification mechanisms that protect the organism against invading foreign DNA. These site-specific deoxyribonucleases catalyse the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates. Of the 3000 restriction endonucleases that have been characterised, most are homodimeric or tetrameric enzymes that cleave target DNA at sequence-specific sites close to the recognition site. For homodimeric enzymes, the recognition site is usually a palindromic sequence 4-8 bp in length. Most enzymes require magnesium ions as a cofactor for catalysis. Although they can vary in their mode of recognition, many restriction endonucleases share a similar structural core comprising four β-strands and one α-helix, as well as a similar mechanism of cleavage, suggesting a common ancestral origin [[cite:PUB00035691]].  However, there is still considerable diversity amongst restriction endonucleases [[cite:PUB00035692], [cite:PUB00035693]]. The target site recognition process triggers large conformational changes of the enzyme and the target DNA, leading to the activation of the catalytic centres. Like other DNA binding proteins, restriction enzymes are capable of non-specific DNA binding as well, which is the prerequisite for efficient target site location by facilitated diffusion. Non-specific binding usually does not involve interactions with the bases but only with the DNA backbone [[cite:PUB00035694]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes the CfrBI restriction endonuclease which recognises and cleaves C^CWWGG [[cite:PUB00045100]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09516" "CfrBI restriction endonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Restriction endonuclease, type II, CfrBI", "short" "Restrct_endonuc_II_CfrBI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 617, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 367, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 290}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
