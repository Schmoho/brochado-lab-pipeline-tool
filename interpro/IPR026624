Cat Eye Syndrome (CES) is characterised clinically by the combination of coloboma of the iris and anal atresia with fistula. CES is a rare condition caused by the duplication of a 2 Mb region of human 22q11.2 resulting in four copies of the region rather than the usual two copies [[cite:PUB00060840]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47399" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 121B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cat eye syndrome critical region protein 6", "short" "CECR6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 439, "taxa" 2016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 866, "sets" 0, "proteins" 866, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 494}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026624", :literature {"PUB00060840" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rosias PR" "Sijstermans JM" "Theunissen PM" "Pulles-Heintzberger CF" "De Die-Smulders CE" "Engelen JJ" "Van Der Meer SB."], "ISO_journal" "Genet.
