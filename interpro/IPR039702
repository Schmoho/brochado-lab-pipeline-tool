{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS; [ec:2.5.1.10]; also known as Erg2) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) are key enzymes in the synthesis of various isoprenoid-containing compounds and proteins. FPS catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate to form farnesyl pyrophosphate. FPS is a Mg<sup>2</sup>-containing protein, binding three ions [[cite:PUB00090001]]. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, GGPS is a paralogue of FPS, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase is a heterodimer of FPS and GGPS [[cite:PUB00090002]].</p>\n<p>This family also includes a further isoprenoid biosynthesis enzyme, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (also known as bifunctional chrysanthemol synthase, chloroplastic) from plants, which has been shown to catalyse two pathway steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins [[cite:PUB00093592]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6se2", "name" "Trypanosoma cruzi farnesyl diphosphate synthase apo structure with zinc ions"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008949", "name" "Isoprenoid synthase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11525" "FARNESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase-like", "short" "FPS1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 244, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2599, "taxa" 9472, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7124, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7124, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4789}, "pathways" 78}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
