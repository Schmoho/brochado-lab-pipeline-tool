{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins mainly found in gammaproteobacteria, including the virulence factor SrfA (SsrAB regulated factor A) from Salmonella typhimurium ([swissprot:A0A0H3NLF1]), a secreted effector whose mechanism of secretion is not known. SrfA belongs to a set of three SsrAB regulated factors, along with SrfB and SrfC. Operons related to srfABC are widely distributed in proteobacteria, suggesting coordinated action, and the three proteins appear able to form a complex [[cite:PUB00105788], [cite:PUB00105789]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040486" "SrfA family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Virulence factor SrfA-like", "short" "SrfA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 119, "taxa" 1315, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1781, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1753, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1371}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047774", :literature {"PUB00105788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lei L" "Wang W" "Xia C" "Liu F."], "ISO_journal" "J Immunol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Immunol", "title" "Salmonella Virulence Factor SsrAB Regulated Factor Modulates Inflammatory Responses by Enhancing the Activation of NF-ÎºB Signaling Pathway.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "792-802", "volume" "196", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26673132}, "PUB00105789" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Sun Y" "Zhang G" "Hou X" "Xiao S" "Yang X" "Xie Y" "Huang X" "Wang F" "Mo X" "Ding X" "Xia L" "Hu S."], "ISO_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "title" "SrfABC Toxin from Xenorhabdus stockiae Induces Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis in HeLa Cells.
