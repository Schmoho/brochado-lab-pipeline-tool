{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subset of the RhsGE element associated Vgr protein family ([interpro:IPR006533]) found only in genomes with type VI secretion loci. However, members of this entry, although recognisably correlated to type VI secretion according the partial phylogenetic profiling algorithm, are often encoded far from the type VI secretion locus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this entry include the actin cross-linking toxin VgrG1 from Vibrio cholerae. VgrG1 catalyses the covalent cross-linking of host cytoplasmic monomeric actin. It mediates the cross-link between 'Lys-50' of one monomer and 'Glu-270' of another actin monomer, resulting in formation of highly toxic actin oligomers that cause cell rounding [[cite:PUB00054068], [cite:PUB00077552]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4uhv", "name" "The structure of VgrG1, the needle tip of the bacterial Type VI Secretion System"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03361" "type VI secretion system tip protein TssI/VgrG N-terminal domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type VI secretion system, RhsGE-associated Vgr family subset", "short" "T6SS_RhsGE_Vgr_subset"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1165, "taxa" 6754, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21450, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21280, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16081}, "pathways" 72}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0735", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0735"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
