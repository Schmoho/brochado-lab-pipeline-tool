{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>VP16 is a component of virion tegument layer that is required for the transcription of the viral immediate-early (IE) genes. In case of human herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, VP16 binds to HCF-1 (host cell factor 1) and translocates to the nucleus to form a complex with the POU domain protein Oct-1. This complex then directs high level IE gene transcription by the potent activation domain in the C terminus of VP16. HCF-1 provides two functions required by VP16, complex assembly and nuclear targeting [[cite:PUB00069879]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16246" "HOST CELL FACTOR C1 REGULATOR 1"}, "pfam" {"PF15226" "HCF-1 beta-propeller-interacting protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Host cell factor C1 regulator 1", "short" "HCFC1R1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 293, "taxa" 1411, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 645, "sets" 0, "proteins" 641, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 394}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029195", :literature {"PUB00069879" {"URL" nil, "issue" "46", "authors" ["Mahajan SS" "Little MM" "Vazquez R" "Wilson AC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
