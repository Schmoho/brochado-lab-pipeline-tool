{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2 kinase), a highly specific kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2), and thus can modulate the rate of polypeptide chain elongation during translation. eEF-2 kinase is part of the family of alpha-kinases, whose catalytic domains display no sequence homology to conventional eukaryotic protein kinases [[cite:PUB00044644]]. This family also includes Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinases A, B, and C, and several mammalian putative protein kinases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038139" "Elongation factor 2 kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase", "short" "eEF-2K"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 642, "taxa" 2325, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1691, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1445, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 888}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
