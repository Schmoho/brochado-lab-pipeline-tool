{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tepsin associates with the adapter-like complex (AP-4) complex, which forms a non-clathrin coat around cytoplasmic vesicles in plants and animals [[cite:PUB00089389]].  Mutagenesis studies have identified two phylogenetically conserved peptide motifs within the C terminus of tepsin that interact with the C-terminal ear (or appendage) domains of the beta4 and epsilon subunits of AP-4 [[cite:PUB00086230]]. The homologue from Arabidopsis thaliana is known as MTV1 (At3g16270), which mediates clathrin-dependent trafficking of vacuolar cargo from the trans-Golgi network [[cite:PUB00089789]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5wf2", "name" "Tepsin VHS/ENTH-like Native"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21514" "AP-4 COMPLEX ACCESSORY SUBUNIT TEPSIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AP-4 complex accessory subunit Tepsin", "short" "TEPSIN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1065, "taxa" 4127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2537, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2537, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1640}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039273", :literature {"PUB00089389" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Borner GH" "Antrobus R" "Hirst J" "Bhumbra GS" "Kozik P" "Jackson LP" "Sahlender DA" "Robinson MS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
