{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Escherichia coli, three cysteine desulfurases (IscS, SufS, and CsdA) initiate the delivery of sulfur for various biological processes such as the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters. CsdA is part of the Csd system. This protein, found in Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Photorhabdus luminescens, and related species, is related to SufS. It works together with and physically interacts with CsdE (a paralogue of SufE) [[cite:PUB00078775]]. CsdA has cysteine desulphurase activity that is enhanced by CsdE, a sulphur acceptor protein [[cite:PUB00043102]]. This gene pair, although involved in FeS cluster biosynthesis, is not found next to other such genes as are its paralogs from the Suf or Isc systems.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ft4", "name" "Crystal structure of the cysteine desulfurase CsdA from Escherichia coli at 1.996 Angstroem resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015422", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, small domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03392" "cysteine desulfurase CsdA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cysteine desulphurase, catalytic subunit, CsdA", "short" "Cys_desulphurase_CdsA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 169, "taxa" 1488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1894, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1894, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1428}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0739", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0739"} {"accession" "GenProp1174", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1174"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
