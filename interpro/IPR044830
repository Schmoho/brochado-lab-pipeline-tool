{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is the Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip III) family of proteins, which includes the five members from Arabidopsis thaliana (REVOLUTA, ATHB-9/PHAVOLUTA, ATHB-14/PHABULOSA, ATHB-15/CORONA and ATHB8) and its homologues from Oryza sativa (OsHOX9-10, OSHOX29, OsHOX32-33) [[cite:PUB00097169], [cite:PUB00097168], [cite:PUB00097170], [cite:PUB00097171]]. These proteins contain an HD-Zip domain involved in DNA binding and protein dimerisation, a START domain and a conserved C-terminal domain of unknown function. This family regulates apical embryo patterning, embryonic shoot meristem formation, organ polarity, vascular development, and meristem function. They show overlapping, antagonistic and divergent functions: PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA perform overlapping functions with REVOLUTA, PHABULOSA, PHAVOLUTA, and CORONA/ATHB15 genes perform overlapping functions distinct from REVOLUTA, while ATHB8 and CORONA encode functions that are both antagonistic to those of REVOLUTA within certain tissues and overlapping with REVOLUTA in other tissues [[cite:PUB00097169]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45950" "HOMEOBOX-LEUCINE ZIPPER PROTEIN ATHB-14"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper family", "short" "HD-Zip_III"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 261, "taxa" 1455, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4369, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2781}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044830", :literature {"PUB00097168" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Agalou A" "Purwantomo S" "Overnas E" "Johannesson H" "Zhu X" "Estiati A" "de Kam RJ" "Engstrom P" "Slamet-Loedin IH" "Zhu Z" "Wang M" "Xiong L" "Meijer AH" "Ouwerkerk PB."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "A genome-wide survey of HD-Zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "87-103", "volume" "66", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17999151}, "PUB00097169" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Prigge MJ" "Otsuga D" "Alonso JM" "Ecker JR" "Drews GN" "Clark SE."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family members have overlapping, antagonistic, and distinct roles in Arabidopsis development.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "61-76", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15598805}, "PUB00097170" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Otsuga D" "DeGuzman B" "Prigge MJ" "Drews GN" "Clark SE."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "REVOLUTA regulates meristem initiation at lateral positions.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "223-36", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11169198}, "PUB00097171" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Brandt R" "Xie Y" "Musielak T" "Graeff M" "Stierhof YD" "Huang H" "Liu CM" "Wenkel S."], "ISO_journal" "Mech Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mech Dev", "title" "Control of stem cell homeostasis via interlocking microRNA and microProtein feedback loops.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "25-33", "volume" "130", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22781836}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044830", "name" "Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
