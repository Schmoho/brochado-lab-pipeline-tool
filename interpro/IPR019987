{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of GTPases associated with ribosome biogenesis, as typified by YsxC from Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00045453]]. This family is widely distributed among bacteria, being found in around eighty percent of currently sequenced bacterial genomes. The proteins are commonly annotated as EngB based on their homology to EngA, one of several other GTPases involved in ribosome biogenesis. Some eukaryotic proteins are included in this entry and probably represent organellar sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1svi", "name" "Crystal Structure of the GTP-binding protein YsxC complexed with GDP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03598" "ribosome biogenesis GTP-binding protein YihA/YsxC"}, "hamap" {"MF_00321" "Probable GTP-binding protein EngB [engB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GTP-binding protein, ribosome biogenesis, YsxC", "short" "GTP-bd_ribosome_bio_YsxC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8203, "taxa" 31780, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32633, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32631, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24790}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0802", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0802"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019987", :literature {"PUB00045453" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Wicker-Planquart C" "Foucher AE" "Louwagie M" "Britton RA" "Jault JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
