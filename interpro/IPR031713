{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein GPR15L is a chemotactic factor and an agonistic ligand for GPR15, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is found in lymphocytes.  GPR15L is found on colon and skin, especially cervix, epithelia [[cite:PUB00088053]] and squamous mucosa of the oral cavity and esophagus [[cite:PUB00088054]]. GPR15L attracts GPR15-expressing T cells including lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00088054]]. GPR15L is also a SUSD2 binding factor, and the interaction inhibits colon cancer cell growth and induce G1 cell cycle arrest by down-regulating cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 [[cite:PUB00088055]]. Additionally, through activation of Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors (MRGPRs) contributes to pruritogenesis by activating itch-selective sensory neurons and mast cells degranulation [[cite:PUB00101332]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15854" "G-protein coupled receptor ligand 15"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G-protein coupled receptor ligand 15", "short" "GPR15L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 99, "taxa" 426, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 131, "sets" 0, "proteins" 130, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031713", :literature {"PUB00101332" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Tseng PY" "Hoon MA."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "GPR15L is an epithelial inflammation-derived pruritogen.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "eabm7342", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35704588}, "PUB00088053" {"URL" nil, "issue" "496", "authors" ["Suply T" "Hannedouche S" "Carte N" "Li J" "Grosshans B" "Schaefer M" "Raad L" "Beck V" "Vidal S" "Hiou-Feige A" "Beluch N" "Barbieri S" "Wirsching J" "Lageyre N" "Hillger F" "Debon C" "Dawson J" "Smith P" "Lannoy V" "Detheux M" "Bitsch F" "Falchetto R" "Bouwmeester T" "Porter J" "Baumgarten B" "Mansfield K" "Carballido JM" "Seuwen K" "Bassilana F."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Signal", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aal0180", "medline_journal" "Sci Signal", "title" "A natural ligand for the orphan receptor GPR15 modulates lymphocyte recruitment to epithelia.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28900043}, "PUB00088054" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ocon B" "Pan J" "Dinh TT" "Chen W" "Ballet R" "Bscheider M" "Habtezion A" "Tu H" "Zabel BA" "Butcher EC."], "ISO_journal" "Front Immunol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01111", "medline_journal" "Front Immunol", "title" "A Mucosal and Cutaneous Chemokine Ligand for the Lymphocyte Chemoattractant Receptor GPR15.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "1111", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28936214}, "PUB00088055" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Pan W" "Cheng Y" "Zhang H" "Liu B" "Mo X" "Li T" "Li L" "Cheng X" "Zhang L" "Ji J" "Wang P" "Han W."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/srep06812", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "CSBF/C10orf99, a novel potential cytokine, inhibits colon cancer cell growth through inducing G1 arrest.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "6812", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25351403}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0001664", "name" "G protein-coupled receptor binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031713", "name" "G-protein coupled receptor ligand 15", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 102}}}
