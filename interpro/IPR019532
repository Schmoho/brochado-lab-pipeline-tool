{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SR-25, otherwise known as ADP-ribosylation factor-like factor 6-interacting protein 4, is expressed in virtually all tissue types. At the N terminus there is a repeat of serine-arginine (SR repeat), and towards the middle of the protein there are clusters of both serines and of basic amino acids. The presence of many nuclear localisation signals strongly implies that this is a nuclear protein that may contribute to RNA splicing [[cite:PUB00044496]]. SR-25 is also implicated, along with heat-shock-protein-27, as a mediator in the Rac1 (GTPase ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; also see [interpro:IPR019093]) signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00044497]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10500" "Nuclear RNA-splicing-associated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear RNA-splicing-associated protein, SR-25", "short" "Nucl_RNA-splicing_assoc_SR-25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 841, "taxa" 3438, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1356, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1332, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 904}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019532", :literature {"PUB00044496" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sasahara K" "Yamaoka T" "Moritani M" "Tanaka M" "Iwahana H" "Yoshimoto K" "Miyagawa J" "Kuroda Y" "Itakura M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
