{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>All mature tRNAs contain a terminal CCA sequence essential for function [[cite:PUB00010739]]. CCA-adding enzyme ensures that each tRNA contains a terminal CCA, either by de novo addition or by repair of a damaged end [[cite:PUB00010740]]. CCA-adding enzyme of this group is a class I nucleotidyltransferase unrelated, except at the active site, to class II CCA-adding enzymes ([interpro:IPR012006]) [[cite:PUB00010741]]). Interestingly, despite the fact that class I CCA-adding enzyme combines tRNA cytidylyltransferase ([ec:2.7.7.25]) and tRNA adenylyltransferase ([ec:2.7.7.21]) activities, it possesses only one active site per monomer [[cite:PUB00010742]]. However, stoichiometric analysis shows formation of a tetramer upon binding of only two tRNA molecules, raising the possibility that two active sites, each responsible for a different nucleotide, form adjacent to each substrate molecule.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1r89", "name" "Crystal Structures of an Archaeal Class I CCA-Adding Enzyme and Its Nucleotide Complexes"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042090", "name" "tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01264" "CCA-adding enzyme [cca]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03671" "CCA tRNA nucleotidyltransferase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005335" "tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme), archaeal type"}, "panther" {"PTHR39643" "CCA-ADDING ENZYME"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, archaea", "short" "CCA-adding_arc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 304, "taxa" 2264, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3111, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2521}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
