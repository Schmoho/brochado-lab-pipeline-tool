{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare genetic disorder belonging to the group of ciliopathies, which encompasses several diseases that are caused by defects in cilia structure and/or function, especially affecting the primary cilium. Mutations of the BBS12 gene accounts for approximately 5% of all BBS cases [[cite:PUB00093550]]. BBS12 is part of the BBS/CCT complex and is required or BBSome assembly [[cite:PUB00069285]]. BBSome plays a key role in mediating molecular/vesicular transport in and out of the primary cilium, and also in intraciliary trafficking as part of the intraflagellar transport machinery [[cite:PUB00093551]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027413", "name" "GroEL-like equatorial domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46883" "BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 12 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chaperonin-containing T-complex member BBS12", "short" "BBS12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 665, "taxa" 2431, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 666}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042984", :literature {"PUB00093551" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Wei Q" "Zhang Y" "Li Y" "Zhang Q" "Ling K" "Hu J."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
