{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pupylation is a novel protein modification system found in some bacteria [[cite:PUB00053382]]. This entry represents two related groups of proteins involved in this system. Pup ligases, such as PafA, conjugate the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup to lysine residues in target proteins, marking them for degradation [[cite:PUB00053383]]. Pup deamidases, such as PafD, catalyse the deamidation of the Pup C-terminal glutamine to glutamate, thereby rendering the protein competent for conjugation [[cite:PUB00053572]]. It has been suggested that proteins in this entry are related to gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetases [[cite:PUB00053382]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7oxv", "name" "Crystal structure of depupylase Dop in the Dop-loop-inserted state"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42307" "PUP DEAMIDASE/DEPUPYLASE"}, "pfam" {"PF03136" "Pup-ligase protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018077" "Predicted proteasome complex-related protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pup ligase/deamidase", "short" "Pup_ligase/deamidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 1701, "taxa" 5379, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12168, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12098, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9307}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1317", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1317"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
