Alpha-L-fucosidase is responsible for hydrolysing the alpha-1,6-linked fucose joined to the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins.</p>\n\n<p>Fucosylated glycoconjugates are involved in numerous biological events, making alpha-l-fucosidases, the enzymes responsible for their processing, critically important. Deficiency in alpha-l-fucosidase activity is associated with fucosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by rapid neurodegeneration, resulting in severe mental and motor deterioration [[cite:PUB00021761]]. The enzyme is a hexamer and displays a two-domain fold, composed of a catalytic (β/α)(8)-like domain and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain [[cite:PUB00021761]].</p>\n\n<p>Drosophila melanogaster spermatozoa contains an alpha-l-fucosidase that might be involved in fertilisation by interacting with alpha-l-fucose residues on the micropyle of the eggshell [[cite:PUB00043486]]. In human sperm, membrane-associated alpha-l-fucosidase is stable for extended periods of time, which is made possible by membrane domains and compartmentalisation.
