{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an activating ligand of the tyrosine kinase receptor Met. It activates Met by binding and promoting its dimerisation. This activation has been linked to promoting the invasive growth of many tumour types [[cite:PUB00015416]]. HGF acts as growth factor for a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types and has no detectable protease activity [[cite:PUB00054731]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defects in HGF are the cause of deafness autosomal recessive type 39 (DFNB39). A form of profound prelingual sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural deafness results from damage to the neural receptors of the inner ear, the nerve pathways to the brain, or the area of the brain that receives sound information [[cite:PUB00063681]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF500183" "Hepatocyte growth factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hepatocyte growth factor", "short" "Hepatocyte_GF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 363, "taxa" 1452, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 820, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 463}, "pathways" 63}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027284", :literature {"PUB00054731" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Tolbert WD" "Daugherty-Holtrop J" "Gherardi E" "Vande Woude G" "Xu HE."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
