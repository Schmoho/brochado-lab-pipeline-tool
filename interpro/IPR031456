{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In eukaryotes, the translation of mRNA is initiated by the binding of eIF4F complex, which is composed of eIF4E, eIF4A and eIF4G proteins. elF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are involved in translational regulation through their interaction with eIF4E. There are two elF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) found in S. cerevisiae, Caf20 and Eap1 [[cite:PUB00075865]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents Caf20 (also known as p20), which competes with elF4G for binding to elF4E and interferes with the formation of the elF4F complex, hence inhibiting translation [[cite:PUB00075866], [cite:PUB00075869]]. Caf20 is needed for the induction of pseudohyphal growth in response to nitrogen limitation [[cite:PUB00075867]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fc3", "name" "Crystal structure of the eIF4E-p20 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17052" "Cap associated factor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cap-associated protein Caf20", "short" "Caf20"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 87, "taxa" 284, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 156, "sets" 0, "proteins" 154, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 110}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031456", :literature {"PUB00075865" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Cridge AG" "Castelli LM" "Smirnova JB" "Selley JN" "Rowe W" "Hubbard SJ" "McCarthy JE" "Ashe MP" "Grant CM" "Pavitt GD."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq686", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Identifying eIF4E-binding protein translationally-controlled transcripts reveals links to mRNAs bound by specific PUF proteins.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "8039-50", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20705650}, "PUB00075866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Altmann M" "Schmitz N" "Berset C" "Trachsel H."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/16.5.1114", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "A novel inhibitor of cap-dependent translation initiation in yeast: p20 competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "1114-21", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9118949}, "PUB00075867" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14-15", "authors" ["Ibrahimo S" "Holmes LE" "Ashe MP."], "ISO_journal" "Yeast", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1415", "medline_journal" "Yeast", "title" "Regulation of translation initiation by the yeast eIF4E binding proteins is required for the pseudohyphal response.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1075-88", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17083129}, "PUB00075869" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Ptushkina M" "von der Haar T" "Vasilescu S" "Frank R" "Birkenhager R" "McCarthy JE."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/17.16.4798", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Cooperative modulation by eIF4G of eIF4E-binding to the mRNA 5' cap in yeast involves a site partially shared by p20.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "4798-808", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9707439}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008190", "name" "eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006413", "name" "translational initiation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0017148", "name" "negative regulation of translation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031456", "name" "Cap-associated protein Caf20", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 24, "alignment:full" 80}}}
