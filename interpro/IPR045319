{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Potassium (K+) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. This entry represents a group of potassium channel proteins from plants, including KAT1-3, SKOR, GORK and AKT1/2/5/6 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00098549]]. Together with AtHAK5, AKT1 mediates high-affinity K+ uptake into roots during seedling establishment and post-germination growth [[cite:PUB00098551]]. KAT1 is required for guard cell K+ uptake during light-induced stomatal opening [[cite:PUB00098550]]. AKT6, also known as SPIK, plays a role in K+ uptake in the growing pollen tube [[cite:PUB00098552]]. AKT1 has been shown to be regulated by the CBL1-CIPK23 complex [[cite:PUB00098556], [cite:PUB00098555]]. SKOR and GORK are both outward-rectifying potassium channels [[cite:PUB00098557], [cite:PUB00098558]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false,
