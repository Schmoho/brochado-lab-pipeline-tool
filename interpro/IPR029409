{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of eukaryotic proteins that aid the production of new cilia in ciliogenesis. Mutations in the human protein cause a disease named Joubert syndrome type 14 (JBTS14), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by severe mental retardation, hypotonia, breathing abnormalities in infancy, and dysmorphic facial features [[cite:PUB00070064]]. Loss of the mammalian TMEM237 results in defective ciliogenesis and deregulation of Wnt signaling [[cite:PUB00070064]]. Proteins in this family are typically between 203 and 512 amino acids in length. There are two completely conserved G residues that may be functionally important.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15383" "Transmembrane protein 237"}, "panther" {"PTHR28388" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 237"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane protein 237", "short" "TMEM237"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 33, "proteomes" 955, "taxa" 3739, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2341, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2251, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1569}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029409", :literature {"PUB00070064" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Huang L" "Szymanska K" "Jensen VL" "Janecke AR" "Innes AM" "Davis EE" "Frosk P" "Li C" "Willer JR" "Chodirker BN" "Greenberg CR" "McLeod DR" "Bernier FP" "Chudley AE" "Muller T" "Shboul M" "Logan CV" "Loucks CM" "Beaulieu CL" "Bowie RV" "Bell SM" "Adkins J" "Zuniga FI" "Ross KD" "Wang J" "Ban MR" "Becker C" "Nurnberg P" "Douglas S" "Craft CM" "Akimenko MA" "Hegele RA" "Ober C" "Utermann G" "Bolz HJ" "Bulman DE" "Katsanis N" "Blacque OE" "Doherty D" "Parboosingh JS" "Leroux MR" "Johnson CA" "Boycott KM."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
