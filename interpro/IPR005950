{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the molybdate ABC transporter periplasmic binding protein from bacteria and archaea. It has been shown experimentally by radioactive labeling that ModA is a hydrophylioc periplasmic-binding protein in Gram-negative organisms [[cite:PUB00028070], [cite:PUB00023373]] and its counterpart in Gram-positive organisms is a lipoprotein. The other components of the system include ModB, an integral membrane protein and ModC, the ATP-binding subunit. Almost all of them display a common β/α folding motif and have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active transport of solutes across the cytoplasmic membrane.

In Gram-negative bacteria the solute-binding proteins are dissolved in the periplasm, while in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria, their solute-binding proteins are membrane-anchored lipoproteins [[cite:PUB00071938], [cite:PUB00071925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1atg", "name" "AZOTOBACTER VINELANDII PERIPLASMIC MOLYBDATE-BINDING PROTEIN"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01256" "molybdate ABC transporter substrate-binding protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004846" "Molybdate-binding periplasmic protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molybdate ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein", "short" "ModA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6339, "taxa" 24170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28129, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28075, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21615}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0192", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0192"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005950", :literature {"PUB00028070" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Rech S" "Wolin C" "Gunsalus RP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
