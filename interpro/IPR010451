{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acetoacetate decarboxylase (ADC) is involved in solventogenesis in certain bacteria, which occurs at the end of the exponential growth phase when there is a metabolic switch from classical sugar fermentation with the production of acetate and butyrate to the re-internalisation and oxidation of these acids to acetate and butanol [[cite:PUB00014916]]. In Clostridium, SpoOA controls the switch from acid to solvent production. A SpoAO-binding motif occurs in the gene encoding ADC [[cite:PUB00014917]].</p>\r\n<p>This family also contains the fungal decarboxylase DEC1 encoded by the Tox1B locus, which along with the Tox1A gene product is required for the production of the polyketide T-toxin. The pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Drechslera maydis) requires the T-toxin for high virulence to maize with T-cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00014918]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4zbo", "name" "Streptomyces bingchenggensis acetoacetate decarboxylase in non-covalent complex with potassium formate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023375", "name" "Acetoacetate decarboxylase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06314" "Acetoacetate decarboxylase (ADC)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetoacetate decarboxylase", "short" "Acetoacetate_decarboxylase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 46, "proteomes" 2263, "taxa" 9220, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10699, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10679, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8014}, "pathways" 54}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
