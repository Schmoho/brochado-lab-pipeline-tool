{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents eukaryotic condensin complex subunit 2 proteins. Included in this group are several Barren protein homologues from several eukaryotic organisms. In Drosophila Barren (barr) is required for sister-chromatid segregation in mitosis. barr encodes a novel protein that is present in proliferating cells and has homologues in yeast and human. Mitotic defects in barr embryos become apparent during cycle 16, resulting in a loss of PNS and CNS neurons. Centromeres move apart at the metaphase-anaphase transition and Cyclin B is degraded, but sister chromatids remain connected, resulting in chromatin bridging. Barren protein localises to chromatin throughout mitosis. Colocalisation and biochemical experiments indicate that Barren associates with Topoisomerase II throughout mitosis and alters the activity of Topoisomerase II. It has been suggested that this association is required for proper chromosomal segregation by facilitating the decatenation of chromatids at anaphase [[cite:PUB00011266]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05786" "Condensin complex subunit 2"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017126" "Chromosome condensation complex condensin, subunit H"}, "panther" {"PTHR13108" "CONDENSIN COMPLEX SUBUNIT 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Condensin complex subunit 2/barren", "short" "Condensin_barren_su2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 69, "proteomes" 2580, "taxa" 8705, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5329, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3494}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022816", :literature {"PUB00011266" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Bhat MA" "Philp AV" "Glover DM" "Bellen HJ."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81804-8", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Chromatid segregation at anaphase requires the barren product, a novel chromosome-associated protein that interacts with Topoisomerase II.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "1103-14", "volume" "87", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8978614}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007076", "name" "mitotic chromosome condensation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000796", "name" "condensin complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022816", "name" "Condensin complex subunit 2/barren", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 48, "alignment:full" 3803}}}
