{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of Csn2 CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins found in Firmicutes, largely Streptococcus and Enterococcus. CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are the main executioners of the process whereby prokaryotes acquire immunity against foreign genetic material. Cas allow short segments of this DNA, called spacer, to become incorporated into chromosomal loci as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats or CRISPRs; the resulting encoded RNAs are then processed into small fragments that guide the silencing of the invading genetic elements. Thus Cas are involved in the acquisition of new spacers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteins in this family are usually longer than the canonical Csn2 ([interpro:IPR010146]) through the addition of a large C-terminal domain. The central domain present in both families appears to be a channel that selectively interacts with dsDNA [[cite:PUB00061063]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16813" "CRISPR-associated protein Csn2 subfamily St"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CRISPR-associated protein Csn2 subfamily St", "short" "Cas_St_Csn2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 205, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 152, "sets" 0, "proteins" 152, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 125}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031820", :literature {"PUB00061063" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lee KH" "Lee SG" "Lee KE" "Jeon H" "Robinson H" "Oh BH."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "Identification, structural and biochemical characterization of a group of large Csn2 proteins involved in CRISPR-mediated bacterial immunity.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22753072}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031820", "name" "CRISPR-associated protein Csn2 subfamily St", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 33}}}
