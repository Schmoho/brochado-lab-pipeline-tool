{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several proteobacterial phosphonate metabolism protein (PhnI) sequences. Bacteria that use phosphonates as a phosphorus source must be able to break the stable carbon-phosphorus bond. In Escherichia coli phosphonates are broken down by a C-P lyase that has a broad substrate specificity. The genes for phosphonate uptake and degradation in E. coli are organised in an operon of 14 genes, named phnC to phnP. Three gene products (PhnC, PhnD and PhnE) comprise a binding protein-dependent phosphonate transporter, which also transports phosphate, phosphite, and certain phosphate esters such as phosphoserine; two gene products (PhnF and PhnO) may have a role in gene regulation; and nine gene products (PhnG, PhnH, PhnI, PhnJ, PhnK, PhnL, PhnM, PhnN, and PhnP) probably comprise a membrane-associated C-P lyase enzyme complex [[cite:PUB00011420]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xb6", "name" "Structure of the E. coli C-P lyase core complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF007313" "Protein PhnI"}, "pfam" {"PF05861" "Bacterial phosphonate metabolism protein (PhnI)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonate metabolism protein PhnI", "short" "PhnI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 1209, "taxa" 5506, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5142, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5134, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4014}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1630", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1630"} {"accession" "GenProp1381", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1381"} {"accession" "GenProp1165", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1165"} {"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
