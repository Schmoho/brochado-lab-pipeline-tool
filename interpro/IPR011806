{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dissimilatory sulphite reductase catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulphite to sulphide, as the terminal reaction in dissimilatory sulphate reduction. It remains unclear however, whether trithionate and thiosulphate serve as intermediate compounds to sulphide, or as end products of sulphite reduction [[cite:PUB00015467]]. Sulphite reductase is a multisubunit enzyme composed of dimers of either alpha/beta or alpha/beta/gamma subunits, each containing a siroheme and iron sulphur cluster prosthetic centre [[cite:PUB00009960]]. Found in sulphate-reducing bacteria, these genes are commonly located in a unidirectional gene cluster [[cite:PUB00015468]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3or1", "name" "Crystal structure of dissimilatory sulfite reductase I (DsrI)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045854", "name" "Nitrite and sulphite reductase 4Fe-4S domain-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02064" "sulfite reductase, dissimilatory-type subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphite reductase, dissimilatory-type alpha subunit", "short" "DsrA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 296, "taxa" 2000, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3999, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3999, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3353}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0155", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0155"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
