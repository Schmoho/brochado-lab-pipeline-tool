{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Streptococcus pneumoniae psaA gene encodes a protein with significant similarity to previously-reported Streptococcal proteins, SsaB (80% similarity) and FimA (92.3% similarity), from Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus parasanguis [[cite:PUB00002030]]. These homologues are associated with bacterial adhesion [[cite:PUB00002030]]. PsaA is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system PsaABC involved in manganese import [[cite:PUB00015631], [cite:PUB00058462]]. It binds manganese with high affinity and specificity and delivers it to the membrane permease for translocation into the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00058462]]. PsaA also acts as an adhesin which is involved on adherence to extracellular matrix being an important factor in pathogenesis and infection [[cite:PUB00015631]].</p>\n\n<p>The SsaB protein has a putative hydrophobic 19-amino-acid signal sequence yielding a 32,620-Mr secreted protein [[cite:PUB00002025]]. SsaB is hydrophilic and appears not to have a hydrophobic membrane anchor in its C-terminal region. A high degree of similarity exists between S. sanguis ssaB and type 1 fimbrial genes [[cite:PUB00002025]]. Comparison of the gene products reveals close similarity of the two proteins. It is thought that ssaB adhesion may play a role in oral colonisation by binding either to a receptor on saliva or to a receptor on Actinomyces.</p>\n\n<p>This family includes adhesins and related periplasmic binding proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00690" "ADHESNFAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adhesion lipoprotein PsaA-like", "short" "Lipoprotein_PsaA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 89, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5217, "taxa" 21582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 162547, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34061, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26044}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006128", :literature {"PUB00002030" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Sampson JS" "O'Connor SP" "Stinson AR" "Tharpe JA" "Russell H."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
