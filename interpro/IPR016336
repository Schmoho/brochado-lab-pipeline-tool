{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatases (PTP) ([ec:3.1.3.48]), including both alpha type and epsilon type. PTP catalyses the dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine phosphate to protein tyrosine, and appear to play a pivotal role in insulin receptor signalling. It can exist as a single-pass membrane protein or in the cytoplasm. PTP-alpha is as a positive regulator of Src and Src family kinases, acting to dephosphorylate and activate Src. As such, PTP-alpha affects transformation and tumourigenesis, inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle arrest, mitotic activation of Src, integrin signalling, neuronal differentiation and outgrowth, and ion channel activity [[cite:PUB00042878]]. PTP-epsilon is a negative regulator of insulin signalling, where the cytosolic form has been shown to act in skeletal muscle [[cite:PUB00042879]] and the receptor-type enzyme has been shown to act in primary hepatocytes and liver [[cite:PUB00042880]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6uzt", "name" "Crystal Structure of RPTP alpha"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002006" "Receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase, alpha/epsilon types"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor tyrosine-protein phosphatase, alpha/epsilon-type", "short" "Tyr_Pase_rcpt_a/e-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 513, "taxa" 1822, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1873, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1141}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
