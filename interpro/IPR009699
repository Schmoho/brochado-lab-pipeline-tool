{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Mastadenovirus E4 ORF3 proteins. Early proteins E4 ORF3 and E4 ORF6 have complementary functions during viral infection. Both proteins facilitate efficient viral DNA replication, late protein expression, and prevention of concatenation of viral genomes. A unique function of E4 ORF3 is the reorganisation of nuclear structures known as PML oncogenic domains (PODs). The function of these domains is unclear, but PODs have been implicated in a number of important cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, transformation, and response to interferon [[cite:PUB00012925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038368", "name" "Mastadenovirus E4/Orf3 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06931" "Mastadenovirus E4 ORF3 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mastadenovirus E4/Orf3", "short" "Mastadenovirus_E4/Orf3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 223, "sets" 0, "proteins" 223, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009699", :literature {"PUB00012925" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Evans JD" "Hearing P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
