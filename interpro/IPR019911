{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a distinct group of proteins within the wider luciferase-like family of monooxygenases, including SsuD from E.coli and MsuD from P.fluorescens which are closely related [[cite:PUB00014324], [cite:PUB00019571], [cite:PUB00103479]]. They catalyse the desulphonation of aliphatic sulfonates in an FMN-dependent fashion [[cite:PUB00019571], [cite:PUB00103479]]. SsuD converts alkanesulfonates to the corresponding aldehyde and sulfite in which it catalyses the C-S bond cleavage of C2-C10 alkyl-substituted sulfonates, in addition to alkyl chains with bulkier chemical groups and larger buffer molecules, whereas MsuD is most active with a C1 sulfonate in the conversion of methanesulfonate to sulfite, completing the sulfur assimilation process during sulfate starvation [[cite:PUB00103479]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036661", "name" "Luciferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01229" "Alkanesulfonate monooxygenase [ssuD]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03565" "FMNH2-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alkanesulphonate monooxygenase, FMN-dependent", "short" "Alkanesulphonate_mOase_FMN-dep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 793, "taxa" 4663, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4184}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0934", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0934"} {"accession" "GenProp1424", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1424"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
