{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Each of these transporters has ten Î± helical transmembrane segments [[cite:PUB00066753]].  The structure of a bacterial homologue of SLAC1 shows it to have a trimeric arrangement. The pore is composed of five helices with a conserved Phe residue involved in gating. One homologue, Mae1 from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, functions as a malate uptake transporter; another, Ssu1from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, is characterised as a sulfite efflux pump; and TehA from Escherichia coli is identified as a tellurite resistance protein by virtue of its association in the tehA/tehB operon. In plants, homologues are found in the stomatal guard cells functioning as an anion-transporting pore [[cite:PUB00066754]]. Many homologues are incorrectly annotated as tellurite resistance or dicarboxylate transporter (TDT) proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3m73", "name" "Crystal Structure of Plant SLAC1 homolog TehA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038665", "name" "Voltage-dependent anion channel superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03595" "Voltage-dependent anion channel"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transporter protein SLAC1/Mae1/ Ssu1/TehA", "short" "SLAC1/Mae1/Ssu1/TehA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 159, "proteomes" 3885, "taxa" 15674, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22438, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22203, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15566}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004695", :literature {"PUB00066753" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7319", "authors" ["Chen YH" "Hu L" "Punta M" "Bruni R" "Hillerich B" "Kloss B" "Rost B" "Love J" "Siegelbaum SA" "Hendrickson WA."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09487", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Homologue structure of the SLAC1 anion channel for closing stomata in leaves.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1074-80", "volume" "467", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20981093}, "PUB00066754" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7186", "authors" ["Vahisalu T" "Kollist H" "Wang YF" "Nishimura N" "Chan WY" "Valerio G" "Lamminmaki A" "Brosche M" "Moldau H" "Desikan R" "Schroeder JI" "Kangasjarvi J."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06608", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "SLAC1 is required for plant guard cell S-type anion channel function in stomatal signalling.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "487-91", "volume" "452", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18305484}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0055085", "name" "transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004695", "name" "Transporter protein SLAC1/Mae1/ Ssu1/TehA", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011552", "name" "Tellurite resistance protein TehA/malic acid transport protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR039264", "name" "Tellurite resistance protein TehA", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR030183", "name" "S-type anion channel", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030185", "name" "Malic acid transport protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 392, "alignment:full" 7770}}}
