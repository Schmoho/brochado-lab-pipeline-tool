{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant mobile domain containing proteins. They are required for the organisation of the root apical meristem (RAM) and the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Proteins in this entry include Protein MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) and its homologues, MAIN-like 1/2 (MAIL1/2) from Arabidopsis thaliana [[cite:PUB00097159]]. They are required to maintain genome stability and cell division activity in meristematic cells [[cite:PUB00097159], [cite:PUB00097158]]. MAIL1 also plays a role in cell differentiation as it acts as an important factor for cell fate determination and maintenance throughout plant development [[cite:PUB00097159]].</p>\n\n<p>In Arabidopsis, MAIN possess three closely related homologues, namely MAIL1/2/3. MAIN shows high protein sequence similarity to MAIL1 and MAIL2, while MAIL3 encodes a protein with an additional putative serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase domain [[cite:PUB00097159]], not included in this entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46033" "PROTEIN MAIN-LIKE 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS-like", "short" "MAIN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 230, "taxa" 905, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13748}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044824", :literature {"PUB00097159" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Uhlken C" "Horvath B" "Stadler R" "Sauer N" "Weingartner M."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "MAIN-LIKE1 is a crucial factor for correct cell division and differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "107-20", "volume" "78", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24635680}, "PUB00097158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wenig U" "Meyer S" "Stadler R" "Fischer S" "Werner D" "Lauter A" "Melzer M" "Hoth S" "Weingartner M" "Sauer N."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Identification of MAIN, a factor involved in genome stability in the meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "469-83", "volume" "75", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23607329}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010073", "name" "meristem maintenance", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0048507", "name" "meristem development", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044824", "name" "Protein MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
