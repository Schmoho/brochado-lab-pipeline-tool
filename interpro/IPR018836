{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Nec1 protein has necrogenic activity on excised potato tuber tissue, and the encoding gene is highly conserved in plant-pathogenic Streptomyces spp. The G+C content of nec1 indicates lateral transfer from an unrelated taxon, but its origins are unclear. Deletion analysis of nec1 demonstrated that the 151-amino-acid C-terminal region of the Nec1 protein is sufficient to confer necrogenic activity. Streptomyces turgidiscabies containing a nec1 deletion was greatly compromised in virulence on Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress), Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco), and Raphanus sativus (Radish) seedlings. The wild-type strain, S. turgidiscabies Car8, aggressively colonized and infected the root meristem of radish, whereas the delta-nec1 mutant Car811 did not. Taken together, the data suggest that Nec1 is a secreted virulence protein with a conserved plant cell target that acts early in plant infection [[cite:PUB00054158]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10379" "Virulence protein nec1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Necrogenic protein Nec1", "short" "Necrogenic_Nec1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 34, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018836", :literature {"PUB00054158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Joshi M" "Rong X" "Moll S" "Kers J" "Franco C" "Loria R."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
