{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum (HRC)  may play a role in the regulation of calcium sequestration or release in the SR of skeletal and cardiac muscle [[cite:PUB00002520]]. This protein is very acidic (31% of Asp and Glu) and rich in histidine (13%). The sequence of HRC contains 10 tandem repeats of a 26 to 29 amino acid residues domain. This domain starts with an invariant hexapeptide (HRHRGH), followed by a stretch of acidic residues. The end of the domain consists of an almost invariant nonapeptide (STESDRHQA). The highly acidic central cores of each repeat are likely to constitute the calcium-binding sites of HRC.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15054" "HISTIDINE-RICH CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sarcoplasmic reticulum histidine-rich calcium-binding protein", "short" "HRC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 243, "taxa" 1106, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 534, "sets" 0, "proteins" 534, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 287}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015666", :literature {"PUB00002520" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Hofmann SL" "Goldstein JL" "Orth K" "Moomaw CR" "Slaughter CA" "Brown MS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
