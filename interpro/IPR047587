{:metadata {:description [{"text" "This family represents the DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease from T5-like phages. It performs endonucleolytic cleavage at abasic sites, which are generated by the base-excision activity of host Ung. The cleavage generates a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl end. The sites are specifically recognized through the formation of a complex with host Ung. The viral endonucleolytic activity damages the host DNA, blocks host DNA replication and induces cell division arrest. This may provide an advantage for the phage and save nucleotides for the viral replication since specifically targets the host DNA, which possesses more misincorporated uracils than the viral genome [[cite:PUB00103950]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04167" "DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease", "short" "APNUC_T5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 273, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 199, "sets" 0, "proteins" 199, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047587", :literature {"PUB00103950" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Mahata T" "Molshanski-Mor S" "Goren MG" "Jana B" "Kohen-Manor M" "Yosef I" "Avram O" "Pupko T" "Salomon D" "Qimron U."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "A phage mechanism for selective nicking of dUMP-containing DNA.
