{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The acyltransferase family described here is involved in the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites, including indole alkaloids, dimeric xanthones, meroterpenoids, cyclopeptides, and ergot alkaloids [[cite:PUB00154531], [cite:PUB00154530], [cite:PUB00154532]]. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of acyl groups, such as acetyl or other acyl-CoA derivatives, to specific substrates, leading to the modification and maturation of bioactive compounds. The family members display substrate specificity and participate in complex biosynthetic pathways, contributing to the structural diversity of natural products with pharmaceutical potential, pathogen resistance, and mycotoxin production. The enzymes are characterized by their ability to tolerate a range of acyl groups and are involved in tailoring reactions that are crucial for the biological activity and final structure of the metabolites.</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes EPS1 that harbours a non-canonical active site and an unprecedented isochorismoyl-glutamate A pyruvoyl-glutamate lyase activity that produces salicylic acid from the isochorismoyl-glutamate A substrate [[cite:PUB00154533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8hbt", "name" "AmAT7-3 mutant A310G"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023213", "name" "Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31896" "FAMILY REGULATORY PROTEIN, PUTATIVE (AFU_ORTHOLOGUE AFUA_3G14730)-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secondary metabolite acyltransferase", "short" "Sec_Metabolite_Acyltrans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 975, "taxa" 3106, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9306, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5549}, "pathways" 219}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
