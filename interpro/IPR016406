{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) ([ec:2.7.7.48]) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses with no DNA stage [[cite:PUB00033622], [cite:PUB00033623]]. It catalyses synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear.\r\nThe postulated RNA replication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA synthesis begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a primer-independent (de novo) mechanism. The de novo initiation consists in the addition of a nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTP) to the 3'-OH of the first initiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this nucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the complementary RNA product [[cite:PUB00033624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents RNA-directed RNA polymerase (also known as protein P2) from various Cystoviruses, such as Bacteriophage phi-6 and Bacteriophage phi-13 [[cite:PUB00042721]].
