{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA3087 and related proteins. PA3087 is an uncharacterized protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a metallophosphatase domain that belongs to the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PPP family also includes: PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7, Bsu1, RdgC, PrpE, PrpA/PrpB, and ApA4 hydrolase. The PPP catalytic domain is defined by three conserved motifs (-GDXHG-, -GDXVDRG- and -GNHE-).  The PPP enzyme family is ancient with members found in all eukaryotes, and in most bacterial and archeal genomes.  Dephosphorylation of phosphoserines and phosphothreonines on target proteins plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes [[cite:PUB00091772], [cite:PUB00035798]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07413" "Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA3087 and related proteins, metallophosphatase domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PA3087-like", "short" "PA3087-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 33, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041766", :literature {"PUB00035798" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Barford D" "Das AK" "Egloff MP."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biophys.27.1.133", "medline_journal" "Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct", "title" "The structure and mechanism of protein phosphatases: insights into catalysis and regulation.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "133-64", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9646865}, "PUB00091772" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Jia Z."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
