{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Maleylacetate reductases (MAR) play an important role in the degradation of aromatic compounds in aerobic microbes [[cite:PUB00084958]]. In fungi and yeasts, the enzymes are involved in the catabolism of compounds such as phenol, tyrosine, benzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate and resorcinol. In bacteria, the enzymes contribute to the degradation of resorcinol, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate ([beta]-resorcylate) and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate ([gamma]-resorcylate) via hydroxyquinol and maleylacetate [[cite:PUB00084412]]. Maleylacetate reductases catalyze NADH- or NADPH-dependent reduction, at the carbon-carbon double bond, of maleylacetate or 2-chloromaleylacetate to 3-oxoadipate [[cite:PUB00084959]]. In the case of 2-chloromaleylacetate, maleylacetate reductases initially catalyses the NAD(P)H-dependent dechlorination to maleylacetate, which is then reduced to 3-oxoadipate. This enzyme is a homodimer. It is inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoate and Hg++, indicating that the cysteine residue is probably necessary for the catalytic activity of maleylacetate reductase [[cite:PUB00084412]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hl0", "name" "Crystal structure of Maleylacetate reductase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08177" "Maleylacetate reductase is involved in many aromatic compounds degradation pathways of aerobic microbes"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Maleylacetate reductase", "short" "MAR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1268, "taxa" 4612, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4512, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4512, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3372}, "pathways" 51}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
