{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the gene 47 protein found in Mycobacterium phage L5 and related proteins from tailed bacteriophages. This protein forms a small globular Î²-barrel domain that is related to LSM superfamily proteins such as Hfq. AlphaFold modelling suggests this protein forms an unusual octameric arrangement. Based on similarity to LSM proteins these proteins may bind to RNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23887" "Phage L5 gene 47-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage L5 gene 47 protein-like", "short" "Phage_L5_Gp47"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 63, "taxa" 475, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 363, "sets" 0, "proteins" 363, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056973", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056973", "name" "Phage L5 gene 47 protein-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 36, "alignment:full" 86}}}
