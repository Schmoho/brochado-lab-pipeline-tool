{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DevT (Alr4674) is a putative protein phosphatase from Nostoc PCC 7120 (Anabaena PCC 7120) [[cite:PUB00083155]]. DevT mutants form mature heterocysts, but they are unable to fix N(2) and must be supplied with a source of combined nitrogen in order to survive. Anabaena DevT shows homology to phosphatases of the PPP family and displays a Mn(2+)-dependent phosphatase activity. DevT is constitutively expressed in both vegetative cells and heterocysts, and is not regulated by NtcA. The heterocyst regulator HetR may exert a certain inhibition on the expression of devT. Under diazotrophic growth conditions, DevT protein accumulates specifically in mature heterocysts. The role that DevT plays in a late essential step of heterocyst differentiation is still unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07397" "Nostoc DevT and similar proteins, metallophosphatase domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR35769" "CALCINEURIN-LIKE METALLO-PHOSPHOESTERASE SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04168" "TIGR04168 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative protein phosphatase DevT-like", "short" "DevT-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 474, "taxa" 2340, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1486, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 992}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1053", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1053"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027629", :literature {"PUB00083155" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 12", "authors" ["Espinosa J" "Brunner T" "Fiedler N" "Forchhammer K" "Muro-Pastor AM" "Maldener I."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.043398-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "DevT (Alr4674), resembling a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, is essential for heterocyst function in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp.
