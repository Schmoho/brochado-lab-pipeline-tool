{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial lytic transglycosylases degrade murein via cleavage of the beta-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, with the concomitant formation of a 1,6-anhydrobond in the muramic acid residue. There are both soluble (Slt enzymes) and membrane-bound (Mlt enzymes) lytic transglycosylases that differ in size, sequence, activity, specificity and location. The multi-domain structure of the 70 Kd soluble lytic transglycosylase Slt70 is known [[cite:PUB00011783]]. Slt70 has 3 distinct domains, each rich in Î± helices: an N-terminal superhelical U-shaped domain, a superhelical linker domain (L-domain, [interpro:IPR012289]), and a C-terminal catalytic domain ([interpro:IPR023346]). Both the U-and L-domain share a similar superhelical structure. These two domains are connected, and together form a closed ring with a large central hole; the catalytic domain is packed on top of, and interacts with, this ring. The catalytic domain has a lysosome-like fold.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry includes membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase B (mltB, also known as Slt35) from E. coli.
