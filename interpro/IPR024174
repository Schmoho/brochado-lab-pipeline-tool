{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; also called scatter factor) and HGF-like proteins (also known as macrophage stimulatory protein, MST1). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an activating ligand of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, whose activity is essential for normal tissue development and organ regeneration [[cite:PUB00054731]]. HGF is essential for placental, liver, and muscle development, whereas MST1 is not required for embryogenesis, fertility, or wound healing. Genes for HGF and its receptor, the Met tyrosine kinase, are close together on chromosome 7, so that polysomy of chromosome 7 may contribute to malignancy through overproduction of both molecules. MST1 and its receptor, the Ron tyrosine kinase, are close together on chromosome 3. HGF and MST1 are closely related to plasminogen, having similar domain architecture: signal sequence followed by a PAN (formerly apple) domain, four (rather than five) kringle domains, and a trypsin domain, which appears to lack any peptidase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001152" "Hepatocyte growth factor/macrophage stimulating protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hepatocyte growth factor/Macrophage stimulatory protein", "short" "HGF/MST1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 611, "taxa" 2090, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3136, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1395}, "pathways" 65}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024174", :literature {"PUB00054731" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Tolbert WD" "Daugherty-Holtrop J" "Gherardi E" "Vande Woude G" "Xu HE."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
