{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP; MEROPS identifier M03.006; [ec:3.4.24.59]) belongs to the widespread peptidase subfamily M3A [[cite:PUB00003579]]. MIP shows similarity to the thimet oligopeptidase (TOP). These proteins are enriched in cysteine residues, two of which are highly conserved, suggesting their importance to stability as well as in formation of metal binding sites, thus playing a role in MIP activity [[cite:PUB00081423]].</p>\n\n<p>MIP is one of three peptidases responsible for the proteolytic processing of both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded precursor polypeptides targeted to the various subcompartments of the mitochondria [[cite:PUB00081423], [cite:PUB00081426]]. It cleaves intermediate-size proteins initially processed by mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) to yield a processing intermediate with a typical N-terminal octapeptide that is sequentially cleaved by MIP to mature-size protein [[cite:PUB00081422]].  MIP cleaves precursor proteins of respiratory components, including subunits of the electron transport chain and tri-carboxylic acid cycle enzymes, and components of the mitochondrial genetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and proteins required for mitochondrial DNA metabolism. It has been suggested that the human MIP (HMIP polypeptide; gene symbol MIPEP) may be one of the loci predicted to influence the clinical manifestations of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by lack of human frataxin [[cite:PUB00081425]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR024077", "name" "Neurolysin/Thimet oligopeptidase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06457" "Peptidase M3 mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial intermediate peptidase", "short" "M3A_MIP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2342, "taxa" 7883, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4567, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4565, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2810}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2039", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2039"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
