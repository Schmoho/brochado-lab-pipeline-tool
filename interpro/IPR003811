{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PlsY is a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) ([ec:2.3.1.275]) that catalyses the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-ACP to glycerol-3-phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) [[cite:PUB00057466]]. During this process, PlsY utilises a novel acyl-donor, acyl-phosphate produced by PlsX. In some bacteria, the PlsX/Y system plays a major part at the initial stage of glycerolipid synthesis [[cite:PUB00068211], [cite:PUB00068212]]. However, in E. coli, the other GPAT, PlsB (described in [interpro:IPR028354]) is also involved in this process [[cite:PUB00068212]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5xj5", "name" "Crystal structure of PlsY (YgiH), an integral membrane glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase - the monoacylglycerol form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01207" "Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR30309" "INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN YGIH"}, "hamap" {"MF_01043" "Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase [plsY]"}, "pfam" {"PF02660" "Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00023" "glycerol-3-phosphate 1-O-acyltransferase PlsY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, PlsY", "short" "G3P_acylTferase_PlsY"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 56, "proteomes" 6081, "taxa" 25199, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26663}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0837", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0837"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
