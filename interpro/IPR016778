{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Competence is the ability of a cell to take up exogenous DNA from its environment, resulting in transformation. It is widespread among bacteria and is probably an important mechanism for the horizontal transfer of genes. DNA usually becomes available by the death and lysis of other cells. Competent bacteria use components of extracellular filaments called type 4 pili to create pores in their membranes and pull DNA through the pores into the cytoplasm. This process, including the development of competence and the expression of the uptake machinery, is regulated in response to cell-cell signalling and/or nutritional conditions [[cite:PUB00052316]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This group represents a competence protein ComB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF020785" "Competence protein ComB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Competence protein ComB", "short" "Competence_ComB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 23, "taxa" 173, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 154, "sets" 0, "proteins" 154, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 130}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016778", :literature {"PUB00052316" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Solomon JM" "Grossman AD."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Genet.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-9525(96)10014-7", "medline_journal" "Trends Genet", "title" "Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in bacteria.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "150-5", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8901420}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016778", "name" "Competence protein ComB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
