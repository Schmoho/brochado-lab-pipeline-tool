{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance gene leader peptides. Inducible resistance to Cm in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is controlled by translation attenuation. In translation attenuation, the ribosome-binding-site (RBS) for the resistance determinant is sequestered in a secondary structure domain within the mRNA. Preceding the secondary structure is a short, translated ORF termed the leader. Ribosome stalling in the leader causes the destabilisation of the downstream secondary structure, allowing initiation of translation of the Cm resistance gene [[cite:PUB00016381]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08077" "Chloramphenicol resistance gene leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chloramphenicol resistance gene leader peptide", "short" "Cmp-R_leader"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 67, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012537", :literature {"PUB00016381" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lovett PS."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(96)00420-9", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Translation attenuation regulation of chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria--a review.", "year" 1996, "raw_pages" "157-62", "volume" "179", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8955642}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012537", "name" "Chloramphenicol resistance gene leader peptide", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 2}}}
