They share the  \"pentraxin signature\" (His-x-Cys-x-Ser/Thr-Trp-x-Ser, where x is any amino acid) and can be divided into a short and a long arm based on their structural organization. Short pentraxins, feature a peculiar quaternary structure with five or ten identical protomer subunits arranged into symmetric pentamers, such as CRP and SAP, are secreted proteins produced by hepatocytes in response to IL-6. Long pentraxins, on the other end, display an unrelated amino-terminal region coupled to a C-terminal pentraxin domain. PTX3 is the prototype of the long pentraxin subfamily produced by myeloid and stromal cells, but not by hepatocytes, in response to primary pro-inflammatory cytokines or microbial moieties [[cite:PUB00093428]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46943" "PENTRAXIN-RELATED PROTEIN PTX3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pentraxin-related protein PTX3", "short" "PTX3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1034, "taxa" 3519, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2806, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2806, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1544}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042837", :literature {"PUB00093428" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Bottazzi B" "Inforzato A" "Messa M" "Barbagallo M" "Magrini E" "Garlanda C" "Mantovani A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
