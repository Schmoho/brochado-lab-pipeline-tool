{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the large subunit of a family of nitrate reductases found in proteobacteria which are localised to the periplasm.  This subunit binds molybdopterin and contains a twin-arginine motif at the N terminus.  The protein associates with NapB, a soluble haem-containing protein and NapC, a membrane-bound cytochrome c. The periplasmic nitrate reductases are not involved in the assimilation of nitrogen, and are not directly involved in the formation of electrochemical gradients (i.e. respiration) either.  Rather, the purpose of this enzyme is either dissimilatory (i.e. to dispose of excess reductive equivalents) or indirectly respiratory by virtue of the consumption of electrons derived from NADH via the proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase. The enzymes from Ralstonia eutropha (Alcaligenes eutrophus) [[cite:PUB00013852]] and Paracoccus pantotrophus (Thiosphaera pantotropha) [[cite:PUB00013806]] have been characterised.  In Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00013835]] (as well as other organisms) this gene is part of a large nitrate reduction operon (napFDAGHBC).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ml1", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Periplasmic Nitrate Reductase from Cupriavidus necator"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01630" "Periplasmic nitrate reductase [napA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01706" "periplasmic nitrate reductase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Periplasmic nitrate reductase, large subunit", "short" "Periplasm_NO3_reductase_lsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 874, "taxa" 4652, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4585, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4585, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3566}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1504", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1504"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
