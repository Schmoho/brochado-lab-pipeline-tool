{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Activator protein-2 (AP-2) transcription factors constitute a family of closely related and evolutionarily conserved proteins that bind to the DNA \nconsensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' and stimulate target gene transcription [[cite:PUB00010265], [cite:PUB00010264]]. Five different isoforms of AP-2 have been identified in mammals, termed AP-2 alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. Each family member shares a common structure, possessing a proline/glutamine-rich domain in the N-terminal region, which is responsible for transcriptional activation [[cite:PUB00010265]], and a helix-span-helix domain in the C-terminal region, which mediates dimerisation and site-specific DNA binding [[cite:PUB00010264]].</p>\n\n<p>The AP-2 family have been shown to be critical regulators of gene expression during embryogenesis. They regulate the development of facial prominence and limb buds, and are essential for cranial closure and development of the lens [[cite:PUB00010381], [cite:PUB00099638]]; they have also been implicated in tumorigenesis. AP-2 protein expression levels have been found to affect cell transformation, tumour growth and metastasis, and may predict survival in some types of cancer [[cite:PUB00010332], [cite:PUB00010369]]. Mutations in human AP-2 have been linked with bronchio-occular-facial syndrome and Char Syndrome, congenital birth defects characterised by craniofacial deformities and patent ductus arteriosus, respectively [[cite:PUB00099637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>AP-2 gamma was originally isolated from murine carcinoma cells [[cite:PUB00010304]]. The gene was found to be expressed in several embryonic areas whose development can be affected by retinoids, such as the forebrain, face and limb buds [[cite:PUB00010304]]. A human homologue has also been identified which is involved in the MTA1-mediated epigenetic regulation of ESR1 expression in breast cancer [[cite:PUB00099639]].
