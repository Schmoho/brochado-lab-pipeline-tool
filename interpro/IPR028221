{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Junctional cadherin 5-associated protein (JCAD) is a component of VE-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions in endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00067705]]. The cell-cell or adherens junction is an adhesion complex that plays a crucial role in the organisation and function of epithelial and endothelial cellular sheets. These junctions join the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane to form adhesive contacts between cells or between cells and extracellular matrix. The junctions also mediate both cell adhesion and cell-signalling. JCAD localises close to the apical membrane in epithelial cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15351" "Junctional protein associated with coronary artery disease"}, "panther" {"PTHR34757" "JUNCTIONAL PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Junctional cadherin 5-associated protein", "short" "JCAD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 629, "taxa" 2146, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1528, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1323, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 186}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028221", :literature {"PUB00067705" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Akashi M" "Higashi T" "Masuda S" "Komori T" "Furuse M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
