{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes budding yeast Spo12 and its paralogue, Bns1, that arose from the whole genome duplication. Spo12 plays a regulatory role in two of the most fundamental processes of biology, mitosis and meiosis, and yet its biochemical function remains elusive [[cite:PUB00010231]]. Spo12 is a nuclear protein [[cite:PUB00010232]]. Spo12 is a component of the FEAR (Cdc fourteen early anaphase release) regulatory network, which promotes Cdc14 release from the nucleolus during early anaphase [[cite:PUB00010233]]. The FEAR network is comprised of the polo kinase Cdc5, the separase Esp1, the kinetochore-associated protein Slk19, and Spo12 [[cite:PUB00010233]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05032" "Spo12 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spo12", "short" "Spo12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 31, "proteomes" 1111, "taxa" 3243, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1614, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1613, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 995}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007727", :literature {"PUB00010231" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Shah R" "Jensen S" "Frenz LM" "Johnson AL" "Johnston LH."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11729145", "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The Spo12 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a regulator of mitotic exit whose cell cycle-dependent degradation is mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "965-80", "volume" "159", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11729145}, "PUB00010232" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Chaves SR" "Blobel G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
