{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Small protein MgtS from Escherichia coli (previously known as YneM), and similar short sequences from enterobacterales. MgtS, the product of a small open reading frame (smORF), is a small inner membrane protein that modulates Mg2 concentrations through its effects on the P-type transporter MgtA. MgtS is induced by very low concentrations of Mg2 in a PhoPQ-dependent manner and acts by binding and stabilising MgtA to increase the intracellular Mg2 levels and maintain cell integrity upon Mg2 depletion [[cite:PUB00105369], [cite:PUB00105763]]. It forms a single transmembrane  helix [[cite:PUB00154067]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033842" "protein MgtS"}, "pfam" {"PF22865" "Small protein MgtS-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small protein MgtS", "short" "MgtS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 503, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 479, "sets" 0, "proteins" 479, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 375}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047998", :literature {"PUB00105369" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Wang H" "Yin X" "Wu Orr M" "Dambach M" "Curtis R" "Storz G."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Increasing intracellular magnesium levels with the 31-amino acid MgtS protein.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "5689-5694", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28512220}, "PUB00105763" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Weaver J" "Mohammad F" "Buskirk AR" "Storz G."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Identifying Small Proteins by Ribosome Profiling with Stalled Initiation Complexes.
