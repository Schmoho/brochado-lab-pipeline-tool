It delivers toxins and a range of hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-active enzymes to the cell surface or extracellular space [[cite:PUB00093998]]. T2SS systems are composed of 11 to 15 different proteins, which are generally called GspA to GspO and GspS. The T2SS spans the two bacterial membranes and ensures secretion of folded proteins across the outer membrane pore formed by GspD. The inner membrane complex contains GspC, GspL, GspM, and GspF. The cytoplasmic domains of GspL and GspF interact with an ATPase, GspE. GspE is thought to energize the formation of a short pseudopilus by several pilin-like proteins, GspG to GspK [[cite:PUB00094004]]. GspD has been shown to interact with the inner membrane component GspC [[cite:PUB00051842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5tkw", "name" "1.35 Angstrom Resolution Crystal Structure of a Pullulanase-specific Type II Secretion System Integral Cytoplasmic Membrane Protein GspL (N-terminal fragment; residues 1-237) from Klebsiella pneumoniae."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01709" "type II secretion system protein GspL"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015761" "General secretion pathway protein L"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II secretion system protein GspL", "short" "T2SS_protein-GspL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1357, "taxa" 5993, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7118, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6999, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5285}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0053", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0053"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007812", :literature {"PUB00010089" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Sandkvist M" "Hough LP" "Bagdasarian MM" "Bagdasarian M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
