{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial malonate decarboxylase gamma subunit proteins. Malonate decarboxylase of Klebsiella pneumoniae consists of four different subunits and catalyses the conversion of malonate plus H<sup>+</sup>to acetate and CO2. The catalysis proceeds via acetyl and malonyl thioester residues with the phosphribosyl-dephospho-CoA prosthetic group of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) subunit. MdcD and E together probably function as malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase [[cite:PUB00012854]].</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Malonate decarboxylase may be a soluble enzyme, or linked to membrane subunits and active as a sodium pump. In the malonate decarboxylase complex, the beta subunit appears to act as a malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, while the gamma subunit appears either to mediate subunit interaction or to act as a co-decarboxylase with the beta subunit. The beta and gamma subunits exhibit some local sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00043059]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vip", "name" "Crystal structure of Pseudomonas malonate decarboxylase MdcD-MdcE hetero-dimer"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029045", "name" "ClpP/crotonase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03134" "biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase subunit gamma"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase, gamma subunit", "short" "Malonate_gamma"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 415, "taxa" 2855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2857, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2857, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2190}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0674", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0674"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
