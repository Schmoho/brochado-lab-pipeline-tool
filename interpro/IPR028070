{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>G6b-B is a unique platelet ITIM-containing receptor that is highly expressed in mature megakaryocytes and platelets [[cite:PUB00151594]]. It inhibits platelet aggregation and activation by agonists such as ADP and collagen-related peptide. It appears to operate in a calcium-independent manner [[cite:PUB00067500]]. It is a type I transmembrane protein that consists of a single N-glycosylated immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like domain in its extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail containing an ITIM and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) [[cite:PUB00151594]]. The human G6B gene encodes a number of splice forms that are translated into both cell-surface and secreted isoforms. Cell-surface isoforms G6B-A and G6B-B have the same extracellular N-terminal Ig-like domain but differ in their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. The extracellular matrix heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan perlecan was identified as a G6b-B binding partner [[cite:PUB00151594]]. Subsequent in vitro biochemical studies and a cell-based genetic screen demonstrated that the interaction is specifically mediated by the HS chains of perlecan [[cite:PUB00151594]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37347" "MEGAKARYOCYTE AND PLATELET INHIBITORY RECEPTOR G6B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G6B family", "short" "G6B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 131, "taxa" 475, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 451, "sets" 0, "proteins" 451, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 288}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028070", :literature {"PUB00067500" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Newland SA" "Macaulay IC" "Floto AR" "de Vet EC" "Ouwehand WH" "Watkins NA" "Lyons PA" "Campbell DR."], "ISO_journal" "Blood", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-09-047449", "medline_journal" "Blood", "title" "The novel inhibitory receptor G6B is expressed on the surface of platelets and attenuates platelet function in vitro.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "4806-9", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17311996}, "PUB00151594" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Vogtle T" "Sharma S" "Mori J" "Nagy Z" "Semeniak D" "Scandola C" "Geer MJ" "Smith CW" "Lane J" "Pollack S" "Lassila R" "Jouppila A" "Barr AJ" "Ogg DJ" "Howard TD" "McMiken HJ" "Warwicker J" "Geh C" "Rowlinson R" "Abbott WM" "Eckly A" "Schulze H" "Wright GJ" "Mazharian A" "Futterer K" "Rajesh S" "Douglas MR" "Senis YA."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Heparan sulfates are critical regulators of the inhibitory megakaryocyte-platelet receptor G6b-B.
