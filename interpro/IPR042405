{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protrudin is a membrane protein that regulates polarized vesicular trafficking in neurons. It interacts with KIF5, a motor protein that mediates anterograde vesicular transport in neurons [[cite:PUB00092940]]. Protrudin contains a Rab11-binding domain,  a FYVE (lipid-binding) domain, and a short sequence motif designated FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) between the Rab11 binding domain and the FYVE domain.  The FFAT motif mediates the interaction of protrudin with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) as well as with Kif5A.  Protrudin has been linked to Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), an inherited neurological disorders characterised by progressive lower-limb spasticity and weakness.
