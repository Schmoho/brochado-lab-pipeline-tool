{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of the peptidase M24B family are involved in the hydrolysis of specific peptide bonds. Members of this family exhibit a range of functions, including the hydrolysis of N-terminal amino acid residues from polypeptides, with preferences for substrates containing alanine or for dipeptides with a prolyl in the C-terminal position. Some members are involved in the degradation of specific compounds such as ectoine, contributing to the utilisation of these compounds as carbon and nitrogen sources. Others are implicated in the cleavage of dimethylsulfonioproprionate (DMSP), releasing dimethyl sulfide (DMS), although the native substrate for some of these enzymes remains unclear. The family also includes enzymes like creatinase, which hydrolyse creatine, and aminopeptidases that preferentially remove methionine when followed by specific amino acids. Collectively, the peptidase M24B family plays diverse roles in nitrogen metabolism, peptide degradation, and in some cases, environmental sulfur cycling.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pv9", "name" "Prolidase from Pyrococcus furiosus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036005", "name" "Creatinase/aminopeptidase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46112" "AMINOPEPTIDASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M24B family", "short" "Peptidase_M24B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6919, "taxa" 27833, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 72255, "sets" 0, "proteins" 72255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 55454}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
