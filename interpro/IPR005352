{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of integral membrane proteins, which may contain four transmembrane helices. Members of this family are thought to be involved in sterol C-4 demethylation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) they may tether Erg26p (sterol dehydrogenase/decarboxylase) and Erg27p (3-ketoreductase) to the endoplasmic reticulum or may facilitate interaction between these proteins [[cite:PUB00019518]]. The family contains a conserved arginine and histidine that may be functionally important.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15451" "ERGOSTEROL BIOSYNTHETIC PROTEIN 28-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03694" "Erg28 like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Erg28", "short" "Erg28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 44, "proteomes" 2155, "taxa" 7150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3547, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3527, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2264}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005352", :literature {"PUB00019518" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gachotte D" "Eckstein J" "Barbuch R" "Hughes T" "Roberts C" "Bard M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
