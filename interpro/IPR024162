{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cbl (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is an adaptor protein that functions as a negative regulator of many signalling pathways that start from receptors at the cell surface, including tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, and T-cell or B-cell receptors. There are three Cbl related proteins known to date: Cbl, CblB, and CblC/Cbl3 [[cite:PUB00055539]]. Cbls function as ubiquitin E3 ligase proteins, accepting ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and transferring it to substrates, promoting their degradation [[cite:PUB00055540]] or endocytosis [[cite:PUB00055541]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8qtg", "name" "Crystal structure of CBL-b in complex with an allosteric inhibitor (compound 9)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23007" "CBL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adaptor protein Cbl", "short" "Adaptor_Cbl"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1020, "taxa" 4013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4561, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2777}, "pathways" 40}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
