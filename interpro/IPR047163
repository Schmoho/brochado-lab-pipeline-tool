{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 1 (ASPP1/2) which are specific activators of p53. These proteins play a central role in regulation of apoptosis via its interaction with p53/TP53 [[cite:PUB00067973], [cite:PUB00093231]]. Regulates TP53 by enhancing the DNA binding and transactivation function of TP53 on the promoters of proapoptotic genes in vivo. ASPP2 inhibits the ability of APP-BP1 (also known as NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit 1, NAE1) to conjugate NEDD8 to CUL1, and thereby decreases APP-BP1 ability to induce apoptosis [[cite:PUB00102068]]. Its apoptosis-stimulating activity is inhibited by its interaction with DDX42 [[cite:PUB00102069]]. ASPP1 homologue from C. elegans, apoptotic enhancer 1 protein (aep-1), negatively regulates apoptosis via its interaction with cep-1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hkp", "name" "Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH) in complex with zinc, NOG and ASPP2 (970-992)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24131" "APOPTOSIS-STIMULATING OF P53 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 1/2", "short" "ASPP1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1014, "taxa" 4038, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5288, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5288, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3116}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047163", :literature {"PUB00102068" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chen Y" "Liu W" "Naumovski L" "Neve RL."], "ISO_journal" "J Neurochem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Neurochem", "title" "ASPP2 inhibits APP-BP1-mediated NEDD8 conjugation to cullin-1 and decreases APP-BP1-induced cell proliferation and neuronal apoptosis.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "801-9", "volume" "85", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12694406}, "PUB00102069" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Uhlmann-Schiffler H" "Kiermayer S" "Stahl H."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "The DEAD box protein Ddx42p modulates the function of ASPP2, a stimulator of apoptosis.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "2065-73", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19377511}, "PUB00067973" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Samuels-Lev Y" "O'Connor DJ" "Bergamaschi D" "Trigiante G" "Hsieh JK" "Zhong S" "Campargue I" "Naumovski L" "Crook T" "Lu X."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
