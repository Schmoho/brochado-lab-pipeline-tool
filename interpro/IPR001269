{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dihydrouridine synthases (Dus) is a large family of flavoenzymes comprising eight subfamilies. They catalyse the NADPH-dependent synthesis of dihydrouridine, a modified base found in the D-loop of most tRNAs. Mainly, they contain two functional conserved domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain (TBD) adopting a TIM barrel fold and a unique C-terminal helical domain (HD) devoted to tRNA recognition. However, DUS2 is distinguished from its paralogues and its fungi orthologues by the acquisition of an additional domain, a double stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), which serves as the main tRNA binding module [[cite:PUB00096089], [cite:PUB00096095]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Dus 1 ([swissprot:P53759]) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) acts on pre-tRNA-Phe, while Dus 2 ([swissprot:P53720]) acts on pre-tRNA-Tyr and pre-tRNA-Leu. Dus 1 is active as a single subunit, requiring NADPH or NADH, and is stimulated by the presence of FAD [[cite:PUB00014304]]. Some family members may be targeted to the mitochondria and even have a role in mitochondria [[cite:PUB00014304]].
