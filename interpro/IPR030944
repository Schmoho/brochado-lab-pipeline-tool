{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family occur strictly within a subset of Mycoplasma species. Members average 750 amino acids in length, including signal peptide. Sequences are predicted (Jpred 3) to be almost entirely α-helical. These sequences show strong periodicity (consistent with long α helical structures) and low complexity rich in D,E,N,Q, and K. Genes encoding these proteins are often found in tandem.
