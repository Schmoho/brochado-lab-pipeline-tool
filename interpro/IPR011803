{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenylylsulphate (APS) reductase catalyses reversibly the two-electron reduction of APS to sulphite and AMP during dissimilatory sulphate reduction or sulphur oxidation. Found in several bacterial lineages and in Archaeoglobales, APS reductase is a heterodimer composed of an alpha subunit containing a noncovalently bound FAD, and a beta subunit containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters. The alpha subunit of APS reductase shares a common evolutionary origin with fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase flavoproteins [[cite:PUB00017742]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1jnr", "name" "Structure of adenylylsulfate reductase from the hyperthermophilic Archaeoglobus fulgidus at 1.6 resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02061" "adenylyl-sulfate reductase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylylsulphate reductase, alpha subunit", "short" "AprA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 245, "taxa" 1735, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1781, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1781, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1336}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0155", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0155"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
