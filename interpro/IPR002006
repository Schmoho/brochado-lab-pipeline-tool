{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent the core antigen of the viral capsid (HBcAg) from various Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is a major human pathogen. The virus is composed of an outer envelope of host-derived lipid containing the surface proteins, and an inner protein capsid that contains genomic DNA. The capsid is composed of a single polypeptide, HBcAg, also known as the core antigen. The capsid has a 5-helical fold, where two long helices form a hairpin that dimerises into a 4-helical bundle [[cite:PUB00030260]]; this fold is unusual for icosahedral viruses. The monomer fold is stabilised by a hydrophobic core that is highly conserved among human viral variants. The capsid is assembled from dimers via interactions involving a highly conserved arginine-rich region near the C terminus. This viral capsid acts as a core antigen, the major immunodominant region lying at the tips of the Î±-helical hairpins that form spikes on the capsid surface.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6t36", "name" "Crystal structure of the PTPN3 PDZ domain bound to the HBV core protein C-terminal peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036459", "name" "Viral capsid core domain supefamily, Hepatitis B virus", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00906" "Hepatitis core antigen"}, "hamap" {"MF_04076" "External core antigen [C]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hepatitis core antigen", "short" "Hepatitis_core"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 83, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 230, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30435, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24041, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002006", :literature {"PUB00030260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wynne SA" "Crowther RA" "Leslie AG."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
