{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of functionally uncharacterised proteins with a length of about 160 residues. A member of this family, E. coli protein YfbU, has been structurally characterised and adopts an Î±-helical structure consisting of two subdomains. It forms a 24-subunit particle with an empty cavity. The N-terminal subdomains in this 24-mer pack around the 4-fold axis while the C-terminal domains interact at the 2-fold and 3-fold axes [[cite:PUB00103940]].  In [swissprot:Q9EUM2] this family is associated with a helix-turn-helix domain. This suggests that this may be a ligand-binding family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wpb", "name" "Structure of Escherichia coli yfbU gene product"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023146", "name" "YfbU, alpha-helical bundle domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023145", "name" "YfbU, helix-hairpin domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00762" "UPF0304 protein YfbU [yfbU]"}, "pfam" {"PF03887" "YfbU domain"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006272" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP006272 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0304, YfbU", "short" "UPF0304_YfbU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 300, "taxa" 2593, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2117, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2115, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1635}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005587", :literature {"PUB00103940" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Wang J" "Wing RA."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr", "title" "Diamonds in the rough: a strong case for the inclusion of weak-intensity X-ray diffraction data.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1491-7", "volume" "70", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24816117}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005587", "name" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0304, YfbU", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 302}}}
