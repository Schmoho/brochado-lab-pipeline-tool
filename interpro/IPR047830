{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase (also known as QHNDH) subunit gamma. QHNDH catalyses the oxidative deamination of various aliphatic primary amines so that they can be assimilated as energy, carbon, and nitrogen sources. This enzyme is composed of three nonidentical subunits, designated alpha, beta, and gamma on the basis of their molecular sizes.</p>\n\n<p>The gamma subunit, the smallest of the three, is buried inside the alpha subunit and it has a particularly unusual structure consisting mostly of featureless coils with a covalently bound quinone cofactor, cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ), derived from Trp and Cys residues, and three intra peptidyl thioether cross-links formed between Cys and Glu or Asp residues [[cite:PUB00105483]]. These structural features of the gamma    \nsubunit clearly indicate that it must undergo multiple posttranslational modifications before it can form an active QHNDH complex with the alpha   \nand beta subunits [[cite:PUB00105484]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pby", "name" "Structure of the Phenylhydrazine Adduct of the Quinohemoprotein Amine Dehydrogenase from Paracoccus denitrificans at 1.7 A Resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036487", "name" "Quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase, gamma subunit structural domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF037958" "quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase subunit gamma"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase subunit gamma", "short" "QHNDH_gamma"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 137, "taxa" 896, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 793, "sets" 0, "proteins" 793, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 604}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
