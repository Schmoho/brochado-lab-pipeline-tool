{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The family includes RNF121, RNF175 and similar proteins. RNF121 is an E3-ubiquitin ligase present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi compartments. It is a novel regulator of apoptosis [[cite:PUB00090657]]. It also facilitates the degradation and membrane localization of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels, and thus plays a role in the quality control of NaV channels during their synthesis and subsequent transport to the membrane [[cite:PUB00090656]]. Moreover, RNF121 acts as a broad regulator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling since its silencing also dampens NF-kappaB activation following stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), nod-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like Receptors (RLRs) or after DNA damages [[cite:PUB00090655]]. RNF121 contains five conserved transmembrane (TM) domains and a C3H2C2-type RING-H2 finger. RNF175 is an uncharacterized RING finger protein that shows high sequence similarity with RNF121.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13407" "RNF121 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RING finger protein RNF121/RNF175", "short" "RNF121/RNF175"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1118, "taxa" 4457, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2718, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2718, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1755}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
