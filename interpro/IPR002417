{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The glycoproteins of viral haemorrhagic scepticaemia virus [[cite:PUB00003479]] and of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus [[cite:PUB00000573]] are similar, and are responsible for forming spikes on the surface of the virion. The glycoprotein mediates binding of the virus to susceptible host cells and induces uptake of the virus by the cell. The interaction between the internal components of the virion and the portion of the glycoprotein exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane probably directs envelopment and virus budding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00796" "SPIKEPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral spike glycoprotein", "short" "Spike_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 13, "taxa" 72, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8786, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002417", :literature {"PUB00003479" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Koener JF" "Passavant CW" "Kurath G" "Leong J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
