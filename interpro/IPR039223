{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF, also known as Che-1) is a adaptor that connects transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle progression, checkpoint control, and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00089516]]. It contains a leucine zipper-containing domain [[cite:PUB00057306]]. AATF has been shown to inhibit the aberrant production of the amyloid beta peptide 1-42 by direct interaction with Par4; this interaction occurs via the leucine zipper.  [[cite:PUB00057401]]. AATF has also been shown to form a nucleolar protein complex with NGDN and NOL10 required for 40S ribosomal subunit synthesis [[cite:PUB00089515]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes the yeast protein Bfr2, which is a component of the SSU processome and 90S preribosomes [[cite:PUB00089514]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15565" "AATF PROTEIN APOPTOSIS ANTAGONIZING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein AATF/Bfr2", "short" "AATF/Bfr2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2525, "taxa" 8505, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4434, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4434, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2887}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039223", :literature {"PUB00057306" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Bruno T" "De Angelis R" "De Nicola F" "Barbato C" "Di Padova M" "Corbi N" "Libri V" "Benassi B" "Mattei E" "Chersi A" "Soddu S" "Floridi A" "Passananti C" "Fanciulli M."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00182-4", "medline_journal" "Cancer Cell", "title" "Che-1 affects cell growth by interfering with the recruitment of HDAC1 by Rb.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "387-99", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12450794}, "PUB00057401" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Guo Q" "Xie J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
