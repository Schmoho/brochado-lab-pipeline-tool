{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several fatty acid cis/trans isomerase proteins, which appear to be found exclusively in bacteria of the orders Vibrionales and Pseudomonadales. Cis/trans isomerase (CTI) catalyses the cis-trans isomerisation of esterified unsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids, mainly palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and cis-vaccenic acid (C18:1), in response to toxic organic solvents, heat and osmotic stress, and heavy metals \n [[cite:PUB00012926], [cite:PUB00098070]]. The CTI protein is located in the periplasm and has been shown to be involved in solvent tolerance in Pseudomonas strains [[cite:PUB00098070]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06934" "Fatty acid cis/trans isomerase (CTI)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fatty acid cis-trans isomerase", "short" "Fatty_acid_cis-trans_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 319, "taxa" 2151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2471, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2448, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1820}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010706", :literature {"PUB00012926" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Junker F" "Ramos JL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
