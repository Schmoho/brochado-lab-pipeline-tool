{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (also known as RING finger and transmembrane domain-containing protein) RNFT1 and RNTF2. RNFT1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a mechanism that protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.  Misfolded proteins that have been accumulated in the ER are targeted for ubiquitination and selectively transported to the cytosol for degradation by a ubiquitin-proteasome system [[cite:PUB00095531]]. RNTF2 negatively regulates IL-3-dependent cellular responses through IL-3Ralpha ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. The RNFT2/IL-3Rα/IL-3 axis may have a role in regulating innate immune responses in the lung [[cite:PUB00151534]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15860" "UNCHARACTERIZED RING FINGER-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1/2", "short" "RNFT1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1254, "taxa" 4968, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4015, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4015, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2591}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
