{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NifL from Azotobacter vinelandii senses both the redox and fixed nitrogen status to regulate nitrogen fixation. NifL acts by modulating the activity of the nitrogen fixation positive regulator protein NifA; NifL inhibits NifA in response to oxygen and low level of fixed nitrogen. NifA and NifL are encoded by adjacent genes. NifL is FAD-containing, and has a domain architecture similar to that of the cytoplasmic histidine protein kinases, containing two N-terminal PAS domains and a C-terminal transmitter region containing a conserved histidine residue (H domain) and a nucleotide binding GHKL domain corresponding to the catalytic core of the histidine kinases [[cite:PUB00042901]]. However, NifL does not exhibit kinase activity and regulates its partner NifA by direct protein-protein interactions rather than phosphorylation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02938" "nitrogen fixation negative regulator NifL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogen fixation negative regulator NifL", "short" "N_fixation_neg-reg_NifL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 138, "taxa" 646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 477, "sets" 0, "proteins" 477, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 352}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
