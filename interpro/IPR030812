{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hercynine is the betaine (trimethylated amino group) form of histidine. It is the precursor of ergothioneine, a thiourea derivative containing a sulfur atom in the imidazole ring. This protein occurs in a conserved four-gene cyanobacterial cassette along with an EgtD, the methyltransferase that converts histidine to hercynine as in ergothioneine biosynthesis, an EgtB homologue that is likely to attach some thiol (e.g. gamma-glutamyl-cysteine) through its sulfur to the hercynine imidazole ring, and a small protein of unknown function ([interpro:IPR030810]). Members are distantly related to phage shock protein A (PspA).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04375" "hercynine metabolism protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hercynine metabolism protein", "short" "Cyano_EgtBD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 93, "sets" 0, "proteins" 93, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 75}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030812", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030812", "name" "Hercynine metabolism protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
