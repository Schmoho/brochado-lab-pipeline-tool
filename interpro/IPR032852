{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AlkB is a dioxygenase that repairs alkylation damage to DNA and RNA [[cite:PUB00076916]]. AlkB homologues (ABHs) are found in all multicellular organisms, as well as in many bacteria and fungi, and some viruses [[cite:PUB00095244]]. Nine mammalian AlkB homologues exist (ALKBH1-8, FTO), but only a subset functions as DNA/RNA repair enzymes [[cite:PUB00076917]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents AlkB homologue 2 (ALKBH2, ABH2), which has a strong preference for double-stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00076916]]. Together with alkyl-N-adenine-DNA glycosylase, comprises the cellular defence against 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine lesions [[cite:PUB00076920]]. ABH2 also has an important role in maintaining ribosomal DNA gene integrity and transcription [[cite:PUB00076919]].
