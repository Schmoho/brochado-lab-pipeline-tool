{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins specific to the African swine fever virus (ASFV) known as the 110 family [[cite:PUB00003487]]. Proteins in this group are responsible for the redistribution of lumenal ER protein to an enlarged ERGIC compartment [[cite:PUB00100272]]. They contain a central cysteine rich region with eight conserved cysteines. Some proteins in this entry contain two copies of the cysteine rich region (e.g. [swissprot:P18560]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01639" "Viral family 110"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "African swine fever virus, family 110", "short" "ASFV_fam_110"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 19, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 340, "sets" 0, "proteins" 269, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004848", :literature {"PUB00003487" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Almendral JM" "Almazan F" "Blasco R" "Vinuela E."], "ISO_journal" "J.
