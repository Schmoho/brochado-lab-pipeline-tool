{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains US10 proteins found in Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). US10 is a unique short region trans-membrane glycoprotein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It down-regulates cell surface expression of HLA-G, but not that of classical class I MHC molecules. Despite of binding to classical class I MHC molecules and delaying their trafficking, it does not affect their steady-state cell surface levels. US10 contains a tri-leucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for down-regulation of HLA-G [[cite:PUB00085208]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17617" "Viral unique short region 10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral unique short region 10", "short" "US10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035128", :literature {"PUB00085208" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Park B" "Spooner E" "Houser BL" "Strominger JL" "Ploegh HL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
