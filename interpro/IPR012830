{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry identifies proteins that are decribed as citrate utilization protein B, restricted to the proteobacteria. CitB [[cite:PUB00016912]] has been identified in Salmonella and Escherichia coli as the signal transduction component of a two-component system for citrate in which CitA acts as a citrate transporter.</p>\n\n<p>This domain is also a C-terminal domain in the Rhodobacter capsulatus (Rhodopseudomonas capsulata) CobZ gene, which in most other species exists as the separate CitB gene (also known as TcuB) adjacent to CobZ [[cite:PUB00106878]]. CobZ is essential for cobalamin biosynthesis (by knockout of the R. capsulatus gene [[cite:PUB00016702]]) and is complemented by the characterised precorrin 3B synthase CobG. The enzyme has been shown to contain flavin, haem and Fe-S cluster cofactors and is believed to require dioxygen as a substrate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036197", "name" "NarG-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02484" "tricarballylate utilization 4Fe-4S protein TcuB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate utilization protein B", "short" "Citrate_utilization_prot_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 486, "taxa" 2583, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2546, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2546, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2022}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012830", :literature {"PUB00106878" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ghosh R" "Roth E" "Abou-Aisha K" "Saegesser R" "Autenrieth C."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "The monofunctional cobalamin biosynthesis enzyme precorrin-3B synthase (CobZRR) is essential for anaerobic photosynthesis in Rhodospirillum rubrum but not for aerobic dark metabolism.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1416-1431", "volume" "164", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30222098}, "PUB00016912" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shimamoto T" "Izawa H" "Daimon H" "Ishiguro N" "Shinagawa M" "Sakano Y" "Tsuda M" "Tsuchiya T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
