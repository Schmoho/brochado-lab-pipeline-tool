{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Blue (type 1) copper proteins are small proteins which bind a single copper atom and which are characterised by an intense electronic absorption band near 600 nm [[cite:PUB00003327], [cite:PUB00003425]]. The most well known members of this class of proteins are the plant chloroplastic plastocyanins, which exchange electrons with cytochrome c6, and the distantly related bacterial azurins, which exchange electrons with cytochrome c551. <p>Several subclasses of the blue copper proteins, such as the amicyanins, azurins, lastocyanins and rusticyanins, have been identified. Although there is an appreciable amount of divergence in the sequences of these proteins, the copper ligand sites are conserved.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00156" "Type I copper blue protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Blue (type 1) copper protein, plastocyanin-type", "short" "Copper_blue_Plastocyanin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 149, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1012, "taxa" 4913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11320, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3967, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2947}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001235", :literature {"PUB00003327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kalverda AP" "Wymenga SS" "Lommen A" "van de Ven FJ" "Hilbers CW" "Canters GW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
