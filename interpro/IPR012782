{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acetolactate synthase is a thiamin pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme that combines two molecules of pyruvate to yield 2-acetolactate with the release of CO2. It exists in two distinct forms that have different properties, though they are clearly related [[cite:PUB00028160], [cite:PUB00015318]]. The biosynthetic form, found in plants, fungi and bacteria, is involved in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids and contains non-catalytic FAD. The catabolic form is found only in some bacteria, participates in butanediol fermentation, and does not contain FAD.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the catabolic form of acetolactate synthase, generally found in species that posses acetolactate decarboxylase, which is often encoded in the same operon. The enzyme is thought to be a homotetramer, though this has not conclusively been shown. Each monomer consists of three distinct domains, designated, starting from the N terminus, as alpha, beta and gamma [[cite:PUB00028161]]. The core of the alpha and gamma domains is a six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, while the the β-domain forms a double Rossman fold. The thiamin pyrophosphate cofactor has an unusual conformation that has not been seen in other enzymes using this cofactor, including the biosynthetic form of acetolactate synthase. The active site is located in a funnel at the dimer interface, bordered by residues from all three domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ozh", "name" "The crystal structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae acetolactate synthase with enzyme-bound cofactor and with an unusual intermediate."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02418" "acetolactate synthase AlsS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetolactate synthase, catabolic", "short" "Acetolactate_synth_catblc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 514, "taxa" 2715, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2426, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2426, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1687}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0272", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0272"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
