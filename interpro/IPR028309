{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the retinoblastoma protein family, including retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB, also known as pRb, RB, p1051), retinoblastoma-like protein 1 (RBL1, also known as p107) and retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RBL2, also known as RB2 or p130). Members of this family contain a conserved domain named the 'pocket' that interacts with the LXCXE motif found in viral proteins, such as SV40 large T antigen [[cite:PUB00067962]]. Therefore, this family is also called the pocket protein family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In humans, RB is a tumour suppressor linked to several major cancers [[cite:PUB00067957]]. RB forms complexes with E2Fs and represses gene expression by recruiting chromatin remodeling factors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) to E2F-responsive promoters [[cite:PUB00067956], [cite:PUB00067953]]. This interaction regulates genes necessary for DNA replication and cell cycle. Phosphorylation of RB family by CDK and cyclin complexes leads to release of the repressor complex and enables E2F-dependent gene expression [[cite:PUB00067953]]. Apart from E2Fs, RB also interacts with other transcription factors that govern cell differentiation [[cite:PUB00067960], [cite:PUB00067959]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4ell", "name" "Structure of the inactive retinoblastoma protein pocket domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13742" "RETINOBLASTOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RB -RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Retinoblastoma protein family", "short" "RB_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1384, "taxa" 5582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6718, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6718, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4090}, "pathways" 55}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028309", :literature {"PUB00067953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Harbour JW" "Dean DC."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.813200", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "The Rb/E2F pathway: expanding roles and emerging paradigms.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "2393-409", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11018009}, "PUB00067956" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sherr CJ" "McCormick F."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00102-2", "medline_journal" "Cancer Cell", "title" "The RB and p53 pathways in cancer.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "103-12", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12204530}, "PUB00067957" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4640", "authors" ["Murphree AL" "Benedict WF."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.6320372", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Retinoblastoma: clues to human oncogenesis.", "year" 1984, "raw_pages" "1028-33", "volume" "223", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6320372}, "PUB00067959" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Thomas DM" "Carty SA" "Piscopo DM" "Lee JS" "Wang WF" "Forrester WC" "Hinds PW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
