{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase (1,2-HQD) catalyzes the ring cleavage of hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene), an intermediate in the degradation of a large variety of aromatic compounds including some polychloro- and nitroaromatic pollutants, to form 3-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconates. 1,2-HQD belongs to the aromatic dioxygenase family, a family of mononuclear non-heme intradiol-cleaving enzymes.  It can act on catechol, but its activity for hydroxyquinol is 6.8-fold higher [[cite:PUB00015256], [cite:PUB00037744], [cite:PUB00089566]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes fungal catechol 1,2-dioxygenase [[cite:PUB00089622]] and intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase hqdA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3n9t", "name" "Cryatal structure of Hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015889", "name" "Intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03461" "1_2-HQD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxyquinol/catechol 1,2-dioxygenase", "short" "1_2-HQD/HQD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1152, "taxa" 4050, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4415, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3144}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
