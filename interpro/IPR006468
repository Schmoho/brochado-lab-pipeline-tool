{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows bacteria to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The enzyme complex is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha, beta and gamma subunits [[cite:PUB00017048]]. The alpha subunit contains a molybdenum cofactor, the beta subunit contains [Fe-S] clusters while the gamma subunit contains haem and is membrane bound. The alpha and beta subunits form a membrane extrinsic catalytic dimer which is bound to the membrane by the gamma subunit, which is a b-type cytochrome that receives electrons from the quinone pool and transfers them to the beta subunit. The three subunits form a stable \"flower\"-shaped structure [[cite:PUB00017049]], where the gamma subunit anchors the alpha and beta subunits to the membrane through predominantly hydrophobic interactions. The structure is further stabilised by the presence of a phosphatidylglycerol molecule that is bound by all three subunits. The alpha subunit uses a Mo-bisMGD cofactor for catalytic activity and, like other proteins that bind this cofactor, forms four α-β domains grouped around the cofactor. Interaction with the other catalytic subunit occurs along an extensive, buried interface.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3egw", "name" "The crystal structure of the NarGHI mutant NarH - C16A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044906", "name" "Nitrate reductase, alpha subunit, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01580" "nitrate reductase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrate reductase, alpha subunit", "short" "NarG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1769, "taxa" 7993, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9651, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9651, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7365}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1122", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1122"} {"accession" "GenProp1583", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1583"} {"accession" "GenProp1329", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1329"} {"accession" "GenProp0636", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0636"} {"accession" "GenProp1676", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1676"} {"accession" "GenProp1474", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1474"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
