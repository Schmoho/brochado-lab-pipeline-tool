{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These proteins are part of the wider family of phosphorylases that typically act on nucleotide-sugar substrates. The proteins in this entry are generally encoded in the same locus as genes involved in the biosynthesis and elaboration of hopene, the cyclization product of the polyisoprenoid squalene. The gene from Zymomonas mobilis is adjacent to the genes for PhnA-E and squalene-hopene cyclase (which would be HpnF) and its association with hopene biosynthesis has been noted in the literature [[cite:PUB00042985]]. Extending the gene symbol sequence,  suggests the symbol HpnG for the product of this gene. Hopanoids are known to be components of the plasma membrane and to have polar sugar head groups in Z. mobilis and other species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03468" "hopanoid-associated phosphorylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hopanoid-associated phosphorylase HpnG", "short" "Hopanoid-assoc_phosphoryl_HpnG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 243, "taxa" 1060, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1060, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1060, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 861}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017831", :literature {"PUB00042985" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Perzl M" "Reipen IG" "Schmitz S" "Poralla K" "Sahm H" "Sprenger GA" "Kannenberg EL."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
