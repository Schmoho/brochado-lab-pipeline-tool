{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family contain a DEP domain, which is a globular domain of about 80 residues. This entry includes GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), such as Iml1 from fungi and GATOR complex protein DEPDC5 from mammals. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Iml1 is a GAP subunit of both the SEA (Seh1-associated) and Iml1 complexes (Iml1-Npr2-Npr3). SEA complex is associated dynamically with the vacuole and is involved in autophagy [[cite:PUB00063317], [cite:PUB00063319], [cite:PUB00087311]]. Iml1 complex is required for non-nitrogen-starvation (NNS)-induced autophagy [[cite:PUB00063318]]. In mammals, DEPDC5 is a component of the GATOR1 complex functions as an inhibitor of the amino acid-sensing branch of the TORC1 pathway [[cite:PUB00092863], [cite:PUB00085662]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13179" "DEP DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vacuolar membrane-associated protein Iml1", "short" "IML1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2274, "taxa" 7595, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6114, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6114, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1171}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2028", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2028"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027244", :literature {"PUB00063317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Dokudovskaya S" "Waharte F" "Schlessinger A" "Pieper U" "Devos DP" "Cristea IM" "Williams R" "Salamero J" "Chait BT" "Sali A" "Field MC" "Rout MP" "Dargemont C."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
