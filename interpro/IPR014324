{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ATP-binding subunit DevA, found mostly in the Cyanobacteria, but also in the Planctomycetes. Cyanobacterial examples are involved in heterocyst formation, by which some fraction of members of the colony undergo a developmental change and become capable of nitrogen fixation. The ABC transporter encoded by the devBCA operon is induced by nitrogen deficiency and is necessary for the formation of the laminated layer which envelops heterocysts [[cite:PUB00007908], [cite:PUB00034607]].  It is thought to be involved in the export of either the heterocyst-specific glycolipids found in the laminated layer, or an enzyme essential for their formation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02982" "ABC exporter ATP-binding subunit, DevA family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit, DevA type", "short" "ABC_heterocyst_DevA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 317, "taxa" 1772, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2040, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2040, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1363}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0649", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0649"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014324", :literature {"PUB00034607" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Fiedler G" "Muro-Pastor AM" "Flores E" "Maldener I."], "ISO_journal" "J.
