{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides to provide the precursors of DNA synthesis. There are three classes (I-III) of RNRs and four known subclasses within class I RNRs (Ia-Id) [[cite:PUB00100956]], which differ by their metal cofactor, their stable organic radical and sequence [[cite:PUB00100955]]. Class I consists of two homodimeric subunits: alpha2, which catalyses the reversible one-electron oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue to a thiyl radical, which is initiated by a dinuclear metallocofactor and tyrosyl radical positioned in the beta2 subunit. Class Ib RNR is encoded in four different genes: nrdH, nrdI, nrdE (alpha subunit) and nrdF (beta subunit) [[cite:PUB00017193]] and has Mn2 in the dimetal cluster to oxidize a nearby tyrosine residue to a stable radical.</p>\n\n<p>This family represents NrdI, a flavoprotein activase which provides superoxide that binds to the beta subunit and forms a hydrophilic channel connecting their active sites [[cite:PUB00017193]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xod", "name" "Crystal structure of flavoprotein NrdI from Bacillus anthracis in the oxidised form"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029039", "name" "Flavoprotein-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37297" "PROTEIN NRDI"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005087" "Ribonucleotide reductase NrdI"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00333" "class Ib ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase assembly flavoprotein NrdI"}, "pfam" {"PF07972" "NrdI Flavodoxin like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonucleotide reductase Class Ib, NrdI", "short" "RNR_NrdI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 1822, "taxa" 7542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7950, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7950, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6045}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0289", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0289"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004465", :literature {"PUB00017193" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Torrents E" "Roca I" "Gibert I."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.26133-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Corynebacterium ammoniagenes class Ib ribonucleotide reductase: transcriptional regulation of an atypical genomic organization in the nrd cluster.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1011-20", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12686643}, "PUB00100955" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hammerstad M" "Hersleth HP" "Tomter AB" "Rohr AK" "Andersson KK."], "ISO_journal" "ACS Chem Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "ACS Chem Biol", "title" "Crystal structure of Bacillus cereus class Ib ribonucleotide reductase di-iron NrdF in complex with NrdI.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "526-37", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24295378}, "PUB00100956" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Blaesi EJ" "Palowitch GM" "Hu K" "Kim AJ" "Rose HR" "Alapati R" "Lougee MG" "Kim HJ" "Taguchi AT" "Tan KO" "Laremore TN" "Griffin RG" "Krebs C" "Matthews ML" "Silakov A" "Bollinger JM Jr" "Allen BD" "Boal AK."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Metal-free class Ie ribonucleotide reductase from pathogens initiates catalysis with a tyrosine-derived dihydroxyphenylalanine radical.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "10022-10027", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30224458}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0010181", "name" "FMN binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0036211", "name" "protein modification process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004465", "name" "Ribonucleotide reductase Class Ib, NrdI", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR020852", "name" "Ribonucleotide reductase, class Ib, NrdI, bacterial", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 47, "alignment:full" 1943}}}
