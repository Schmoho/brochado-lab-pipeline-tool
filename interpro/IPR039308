{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Growth arrest-specific protein 8 (Gas8; also known as dynein regulatory complex subunit 4, DRC4) is a microtubule-binding protein localised to regions of dynein regulation in mammalian cells. In mouse, Gas8 is predominantly a testicular protein, whose expression is developmentally regulated during puberty and spermatogenesis. In humans, it is absent in infertile males who lack the ability to generate gametes. The localisation of Gas8 in the motility apparatus of post-meiotic gametocytes and mature spermatozoa, together with the detection of Gas8 also in cilia at the apical surfaces of epithelial cells lining the pulmonary bronchi and Fallopian tubes suggests that the Gas8 protein may have a role in the functioning of motile cellular appendages [[cite:PUB00057367]].  Homologues are also found in apicomplexans and invertebrates.  In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Gas8 is a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, which is a regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility [[cite:PUB00089658]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31543" "DYNEIN REGULATORY COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Growth arrest-specific protein 8", "short" "GAS8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1101, "taxa" 4443, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2654, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2654, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1880}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039308", :literature {"PUB00057367" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Yeh SD" "Chen YJ" "Chang AC" "Ray R" "She BR" "Lee WS" "Chiang HS" "Cohen SN" "Lin-Chao S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
