{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are essentially universal in the class Clostridia and therefore highly abundant in the human gut microbiome. This short peptide is designated SCIFF, for Six Cysteines in Forty-Five residues. It is a presumed ribosomal natural product precursor, always found associated with a yet-uncharacterised radical SAM protein, family [interpro:IPR024025], that resembles other peptide modification radical SAM enzymes and is designated SCIFF radical SAM maturase [[cite:PUB00055953]]. The literature originally described the thioether cross-link introduced by ScfB from a Cys side chain as going to the alpha carbon (making SCIFF a \"sactipeptide\") of a Met residue, but more recently is was found to go elsewhere (making it a \"ranthipeptide\"), to the gamma carbon of a Thr residue [[cite:PUB00106801], [cite:PUB00106802]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03973" "six-cysteine ranthipeptide SCIFF"}, "pfam" {"PF13165" "Six-cysteine peptide SCIFF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Six-cysteine peptide SCIFF", "short" "Six-Cys_pep_SCIFF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 690, "taxa" 2597, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2550, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2542, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1796}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0919", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0919"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023975", :literature {"PUB00106801" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["Bruender NA" "Bandarian V."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "SkfB Abstracts a Hydrogen Atom from CÎ± on SkfA To Initiate Thioether Cross-Link Formation.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "4131-4", "volume" "55", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27410522}, "PUB00106802" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Chen Y" "Yang Y" "Ji X" "Zhao R" "Li G" "Gu Y" "Shi A" "Jiang W" "Zhang Q."], "ISO_journal" "Biotechnol J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biotechnol J", "title" "The SCIFF-Derived Ranthipeptides Participate in Quorum Sensing in Solventogenic Clostridia.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "e2000136", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32713052}, "PUB00055953" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Basu MK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
