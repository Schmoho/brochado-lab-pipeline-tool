Chitosan is a biopolymer of beta (1,4)-linked -D-glucosamine (GlcN) residues produced by partial or full deacetylation of chitin. Chitosanases play a role in defense against pathogens such as fungi and are found in microorganisms, fungi, viruses, and plants. Microbial chitosanases whose members are the most prevalent can be divided into 3 subclasses based on the specificity of the cleavage positions for partial acetylated chitosan.  Subclass I chitosanases such as N174 can split GlcN-GlcN and GlcNAc-GlcN linkages, whereas subclass II chitosanases such as Bacillus sp. no. 7-M can cleave only GlcN-GlcN linkages. Subclass III chitosanases such as MH-K1 chitosanase are the most versatile and can split both GlcN-GlcN and GlcN-GlcNAc linkages [[cite:PUB00079509], [cite:PUB00036505], [cite:PUB00079510], [cite:PUB00079511]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7c6c", "name" "Crystal structure of native chitosanase from Bacillus subtilis MY002"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023346", "name" "Lysozyme-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023099", "name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 46, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00978" "chitosanase belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase 46 family"}, "prosite" {"PS60000" "Chitosanases families 46 and 80 active sites signature"}, "pfam" {"PF01374" "Glycosyl hydrolase family 46"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF036551" "Chitosanase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycoside hydrolase, family 46", "short" "Glyco_hydro_46"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 621, "taxa" 2685, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2729, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2683, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1712}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GH46", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GH46.html"}]}, "prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC60000", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC60000"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
