{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are always found next to an exosortase/archaeosortase-like protein XrtF, and occur so far only in the flavobacteria, within the Bacteroidetes [[cite:PUB00060405]]. Members do not have an obvious PEP-CTERM-like C-terminal protein sorting domain. Instead, members of this family have strongly hydrophobic nature that suggests a possible role in letting other proteins, targeted by XrtF, transit the outer membrane. This protein and its neighbour XrtF have been shown to play a role in surface attachment by Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a species that, notably, also has a type IX secretion system (T9SS) relevant to surface attachment [[cite:PUB00159625]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04127" "exosortase F system-associated membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exosortase F-associated membrane protein", "short" "ExosoTase_F-assoc_memb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 270, "taxa" 1020, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 921, "sets" 0, "proteins" 921, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 765}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0980", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0980"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026414", :literature {"PUB00060405" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Payne SH" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
