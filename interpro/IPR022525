{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are GNAT family acetyltransferases, based on a seed alignment in which every member is associated with a lysine 2,3-aminomutase family protein, usually as the adjacent gene. This family includes AblB, the enzyme beta-lysine acetyltransferase that completes the two-step synthesis of the osmolyte (compatible solute) N-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine; all members of the family may have this function [[cite:PUB00094540]]. Note that N-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine has been observed only in methanogenic archaea (e.g. Methanosarcina) but that this model, paired with Lysine-2,3-aminomutase ([interpro:IPR022459]), suggests a much broader distribution.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016181", "name" "Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03827" "putative beta-lysine N-acetyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-lysine N-acetyltransferase", "short" "GNAT_AblB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 363, "taxa" 1721, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1410, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1410, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1047}, "pathways" 218}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0878", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0878"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
