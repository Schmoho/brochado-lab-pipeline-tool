{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the DNA type IV secretion system protein ComB10 ([swissprot:O24883]), a VirB10 homologue from Helicobacter pylori. ComB10 is an outer membrane-associated component of a DNA-translocating type IV secretion system (T4SS) involved in competence. In contrast to most T4SS that translocate protein toxins and other virulence factors into host cells , ComB10 as found in Helicobacter, and the T4SS of Agrobacterium, translocate DNA and function in DNA uptake or release [[cite:PUB00151247]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of the C-terminal periplasmic domain of ComB10 was determined ([pdbe:2BHV]) and consists of a β-barrel capped on both sides with β-hairpins, one of which containing an α-helical insertion that protrudes from the top of the barrel and it is anticipated to be involved in protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00032762]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042217", "name" "Type IV secretion system, VirB10/TrbI", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038092" "DNA type IV secretion system protein ComB10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type IV secretion system, ComB10-like", "short" "T4SS_ComB10-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 165, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 368, "sets" 0, "proteins" 368, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 309}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048018", :literature {"PUB00032762" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Terradot L" "Bayliss R" "Oomen C" "Leonard GA" "Baron C" "Waksman G."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
