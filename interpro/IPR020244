It is involved in genome replication, playing a crucial role in the formation of virus factories (viroplasms) which are large inclusions in the cytoplasm where core-like replication intermediates are assembled and RNA replication takes place. It forms a homodimer that interacts with VP1, VP2 and NSP2; these interaction lead to the formation of the virus factories.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17580" "Group B Rotavirus Non-structural protein 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rotavirus B, non-structural protein 5", "short" "Rotavirus_B_NSP5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 42, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 117, "sets" 0, "proteins" 115, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020244", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020244", "name" "Rotavirus B, non-structural protein 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 8}}}
