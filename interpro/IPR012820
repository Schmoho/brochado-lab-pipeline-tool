{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents sucrose synthase an enzyme that despite its name, generally uses rather produces sucrose. Sucrose plus UDP (or ADP) becomes D-fructose plus UDP-glucose (or ADP-glucose), which is then available for cell wall (or starch) biosynthesis. The enzyme is homologous to sucrose phosphate synthase, which catalyses the penultimate step in sucrose synthesis. Sucrose synthase is found, so far, exclusively in plants and cyanobacteria [[cite:PUB00017811]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45839" "PTHR45839"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02470" "sucrose synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sucrose synthase, plant/cyanobacteria", "short" "Sucrose_synthase_pln/cyn"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 443, "taxa" 2574, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5517, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5452, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3513}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1639", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1639"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
