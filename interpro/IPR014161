{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tol proteins are involved in the translocation of group A colicins. Colicins are bacterial protein toxins, which are active against Escherichia coli and other related species. TolA is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by a single membrane spanning segment near the N terminus, leaving most of the protein exposed to the periplasm [[cite:PUB00012639]].</p>\n\n<p>TolA couples the inner membrane complex of itself with TolQ and TolR to the outer membrane complex of TolB and OprL (also called Pal). Most of the length of the protein consists of low-complexity sequence that may differ in both length and composition from one species to another, complicating efforts to discriminate TolA (the most divergent gene in the tol-pal system) from paralogs such as TonB. Selection of members of the seed alignment and criteria for setting scoring cut-offs are based largely on conserved operon structure. The Tol-Pal complex is required for maintaining outer membrane integrity, and is also involved in transport (uptake) of colicins and filamentous DNA, and implicated in pathogenesis [[cite:PUB00106716]]. Transport is energized by the proton motive force. TolA is an inner membrane protein that interacts with periplasmic TolB and with outer membrane porins OmpC, PhoE and LamB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1lr0", "name" "Pseudomonas aeruginosa TolA Domain III, Seleno-methionine Derivative"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06519" "TolA C-terminal"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02794" "cell envelope integrity protein TolA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tol-Pal system, TolA", "short" "Tol-Pal_TolA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 1520, "taxa" 7603, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10371, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7587}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0542", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0542"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014161", :literature {"PUB00106716" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Lahiri A" "Ananthalakshmi TK" "Nagarajan AG" "Ray S" "Chakravortty D."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "TolA mediates the differential detergent resistance pattern between the Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars Typhi and Typhimurium.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1402-1415", "volume" "157", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21252278}, "PUB00012639" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5-6", "authors" ["Lazzaroni JC" "Dubuisson JF" "Vianney A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochimie", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0300-9084(02)01419-0", "medline_journal" "Biochimie", "title" "The Tol proteins of Escherichia coli and their involvement in the translocation of group A colicins.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "391-7", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12423782}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0019534", "name" "toxin transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0043213", "name" "bacteriocin transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014161", "name" "Tol-Pal system, TolA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 433}}}
