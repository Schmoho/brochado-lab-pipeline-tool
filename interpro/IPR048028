{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from cyanobacteria, including Psb34 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ([swissprot:P74067]). Members of this family are small, usually about 56 amino acids, with an N-terminal half related to HliA/B proteins belonging to a family of high-light-inducible proteins (Hlips), and a highly hydrophobic C-terminal half embedded in the thylakoid membrane [[cite:PUB00152828]]. It has been proposed that the Psb34 protein regulates the binding of high-light-inducible proteins to assembly intermediates of photosystem II that contain CP47 [[cite:PUB00152830]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033486" "photosystem II assembly protein Psb34"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem II assembly protein Psb34-like", "short" "Psb34-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 176, "taxa" 1138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1179, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 824}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048028", :literature {"PUB00152830" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Rahimzadeh-Karvansara P" "Pascual-Aznar G" "Beckova M" "Komenda J."], "ISO_journal" "Photosynth Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-022-00908-9", "medline_journal" "Photosynth Res", "title" "Psb34 protein modulates binding of high-light-inducible proteins to CP47-containing photosystem II assembly intermediates in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
