{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a second messenger that acts as a protein kinase C activator. Upon cell stimulation, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) converts DAG into phosphatidate, initiating the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositols and attenuating protein kinase C activity [[cite:PUB00087376], [cite:PUB00044044]]. Most vertebrate species contain 10 different DGK isozymes. The catalytic domain constitutes the single largest sequence element within the DGK proteins that is commonly and uniquely shared by all family members [[cite:PUB00044044]]. DGK proteins can be classified into five classes based on the presence or absence of specific functional domains. DGKs play an important role in controlling diverse cellular processes including development, cell division and proliferation, neuronal and immune responses, vascular traffic, apoptosis and cytoskeletal reorganization [[cite:PUB00087377]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016064", "name" "NAD kinase/diacylglycerol kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11255" "DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diacylglycerol kinase", "short" "DGK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1573, "taxa" 6341, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 26457, "sets" 0, "proteins" 26457, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15325}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
