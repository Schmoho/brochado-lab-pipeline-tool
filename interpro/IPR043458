{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group includes orphan receptors GPR158, GPR158-like (also called GPR179) and similar proteins. These orphan receptors are closely related to the type B receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-B), which is activated by its endogenous ligand GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter [[cite:PUB00094046]]. Both GPR179 and GPR158 were shown to recruit regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) complexes and thus regulate activity of other GPCRs [[cite:PUB00094047]].</p>\n\n<p>GPR158 has been suggested to act as a homeostatic regulator of intraocular pressure and could be a pharmacological target for managing ocular hypertension [[cite:PUB00094049], [cite:PUB00094048]]. It has been linked to prostate cancer growth and progression [[cite:PUB00094050]]. It functions in cognition, stress-induced mood control, and synaptic development [[cite:PUB00151537]] and it also serves as a novel regulator operating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that links chronic stress to depression [[cite:PUB00094051]]. GPR158 has been recently described as metabotropic glycine receptor (mGlyR) through which glycine signals to inhibit production of the second messenger adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate [[cite:PUB00151535]]. Glycine acts through this receptor and regulates neuronal excitability in cortical neurons. Structure determination of GPR158 revealed that it consists or an N-terminal extracellular domain that has a fold similar to Cache domains and a transmembrane domain, connected by a linker [[cite:PUB00151536], [cite:PUB00151537]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32546" "G-PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR 158-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "G-protein coupled receptor 158/179", "short" "GPR158/179"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 989, "taxa" 3941, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4608, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4608, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2467}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043458", :literature {"PUB00094050" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Patel N" "Itakura T" "Jeong S" "Liao CP" "Roy-Burman P" "Zandi E" "Groshen S" "Pinski J" "Coetzee GA" "Gross ME" "Fini ME."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Expression and functional role of orphan receptor GPR158 in prostate cancer growth and progression.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e0117758", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25693195}, "PUB00151537" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Jeong E" "Kim Y" "Jeong J" "Cho Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27147-1", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Structure of the class C orphan GPCR GPR158 in complex with RGS7-Gβ5.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "6805", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34815401}, "PUB00094047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Orlandi C" "Posokhova E" "Masuho I" "Ray TA" "Hasan N" "Gregg RG" "Martemyanov KA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
