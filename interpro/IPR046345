{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes TraB/PrgY proteins which have been identified in gut bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, and are induced by pheromones. This induction rends the host bacterium insensitive to self-induction by its own pheromones, and prevents the transfer of the pheromone-inducible conjugative plasmids to bacteria that already contain it [[cite:PUB00005724], [cite:PUB00099794], [cite:PUB00099793]]. TraB proteins belong to the Tiki-like superfamily, and based on its homology to Tiki, it has been proposed that TraB acts as a protease in the inactivation of mating pheromone, cleaving at the amino-terminus [[cite:PUB00075535], [cite:PUB00099795], [cite:PUB00095434]].</p>\n\n<p>This family includes TraB domain-containing proteins from mammals, whose function is not clear, and TraB-like proteins from bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14726" "TraB/PryY confer plasmid-borne pheromone resistance"}, "panther" {"PTHR21530" "PHEROMONE SHUTDOWN PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TraB/PryY-like", "short" "TraB_PrgY-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2224, "taxa" 9917, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9085, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9058, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6515}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046345", :literature {"PUB00005724" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["An FY" "Clewell DB."], "ISO_journal" "Plasmid", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/plas.1994.1023", "medline_journal" "Plasmid", "title" "Characterization of the determinant (traB) encoding sex pheromone shutdown by the hemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid pAD1 in Enterococcus faecalis.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "215-21", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8029329}, "PUB00075535" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Sanchez-Pulido L" "Ponting CP."], "ISO_journal" "Bioinformatics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt412", "medline_journal" "Bioinformatics", "title" "Tiki, at the head of a new superfamily of enzymes.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "2371-4", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23868957}, "PUB00095434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bazan JF" "Macdonald BT" "He X."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
