{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes the GINS subunit Gins51 from Thermococcus kodakarensis and similar proteins from archaea. Archaeal GINS is a α2β2 type tetramer that plays a key role to move from initiation to elongation of the DNA replication. Gin51 is organised into a larger α-helical domain at the N-terminal and a smaller β-stranded domain at the C-terminal, showing the same structural domains as the other subunit of the complex, Gin23, in reverse order [[cite:PUB00088351]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF019075" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP019075 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Archaeal GINS complex, Gins51 subunit", "short" "Gins51"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 33, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016745", :literature {"PUB00088351" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Oyama T" "Ishino S" "Fujino S" "Ogino H" "Shirai T" "Mayanagi K" "Saito M" "Nagasawa N" "Ishino Y" "Morikawa K."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-9-28", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Architectures of archaeal GINS complexes, essential DNA replication initiation factors.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "28", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21527023}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016745", "name" "Archaeal GINS complex, Gins51 subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
