{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>A number of genes are expressed exclusively in the retina, where they appear to control the specialised functions of various different cell types [[cite:PUB00054089]]. One of these retinal genes (termed FAM138A/B/C/F) is found within a region of subtelomeric DNA and exhibits polymorphic distribution among multiple chromosomes [[cite:PUB00054089]]. This gene encodes a putative 85-amino acid polypeptide (also known as retina-specific protein F379) that shares a high level of similarity with the retinal protein FAM138D; both also include a well-conserved N-terminal domain that is shared by a wide range of proteins, including podocalyxin-like protein 1, proto-oncogene c-Rel, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 homologue, and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 19.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02046" "Retina-specific protein F379 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAM138", "short" "FAM138"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 61, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 58, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023245", :literature {"PUB00054089" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Mah N" "Stoehr H" "Schulz HL" "White K" "Weber BH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
