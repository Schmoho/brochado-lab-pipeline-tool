{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The SAP domain-containing ribonucleoprotein family includes SARNP from animals and its orthologues from yeast THO1 and mlo1. This family is involved in various cellular processes including DNA and RNA binding, transcriptional and translational control, and mRNA export. Members of the family have a higher affinity for single-stranded DNA and are known to bind scaffold/matrix attachment region DNA, as well as single-stranded RNA. They enhance the RNA unwinding activity of DDX39A and may play a role in cell growth, metabolism, and carcinogenesis. These proteins are components of the TREX complex, which is associated with spliced mRNA and is involved in coupling mRNA transcription, processing, and nuclear export [[cite:PUB00154991], [cite:PUB00154992], [cite:PUB00154993]]. The complex is recruited to mRNA near the 5' end and functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP/NFX1 pathway. Additionally, the TREX complex is essential for the export of certain viral mRNAs and virus production. It also associates with DDX39B, which facilitates RNA binding of DDX39B and likely plays a role in mRNA export [cite:PUB00154994]]</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46551" "SAP DOMAIN-CONTAINING RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SAP domain-containing ribonucleoprotein", "short" "SAP_domain_ribonucleoprotein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2062, "taxa" 7326, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4181, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2769}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052240", :literature {"PUB00154992" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sugiura T" "Sakurai K" "Nagano Y."], "ISO_journal" "Exp Cell Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.11.014", "medline_journal" "Exp Cell Res", "title" "Intracellular characterization of DDX39, a novel growth-associated RNA helicase.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "782-90", "volume" "313", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17196963}, "PUB00154993" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Dufu K" "Livingstone MJ" "Seebacher J" "Gygi SP" "Wilson SA" "Reed R."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.1898610", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "ATP is required for interactions between UAP56 and two conserved mRNA export proteins, Aly and CIP29, to assemble the TREX complex.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "2043-53", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20844015}, "PUB00154994" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Xie Y" "Gao S" "Zhang K" "Bhat P" "Clarke BP" "Batten K" "Mei M" "Gazzara M" "Shay JW" "Lynch KW" "Angelos AE" "Hill PS" "Ivey AL" "Fontoura BMA" "Ren Y."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112988", "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Structural basis for high-order complex of SARNP and DDX39B to facilitate mRNP assembly.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "112988", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37578863}, "PUB00154991" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Leaw CL" "Ren EC" "Choong ML."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Mol Life Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-004-4205-x", "medline_journal" "Cell Mol Life Sci", "title" "Hcc-1 is a novel component of the nuclear matrix with growth inhibitory function.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "2264-73", "volume" "61", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15338056}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR052240", "name" "SAP domain-containing ribonucleoprotein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
