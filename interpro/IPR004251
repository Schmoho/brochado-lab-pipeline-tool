{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes two of the eight entry-fusion complex proteins of pox viruses. The viral fusion proteins are components of the mature virion, MV, membrane. Extracellular enveloped virions (EVs), the infecting particles, are MVs with an additional membrane that is opened or removed prior to the fusion of the MV and cell membrane during virus entry. G9 (also known as Entry-fusion complex protein OPG094) and A16 (Virion membrane protein OPG143) interact closely with each other and each is required for membrane fusion and virus entry as well as for interaction with A56/K2 [[cite:PUB00078710]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03003" "Pox virus entry-fusion-complex G9/A16"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pox virus entry-fusion-complex G9/A16", "short" "Pox_virus_G9/A16"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 53, "taxa" 269, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 610, "sets" 0, "proteins" 610, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004251", :literature {"PUB00078710" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Wagenaar TR" "Ojeda S" "Moss B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
