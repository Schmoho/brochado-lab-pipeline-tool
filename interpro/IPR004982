{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This Schizosaccharomyces family consists of post-meiotic segregation distorting elements (meiotic drivers). Meiotic drivers are selfish genes that break Mendel's law by skewing transmission rates to their own advantage, thereby contributing to reproductive isolation [[cite:PUB00086063], [cite:PUB00086064], [cite:PUB00097202], [cite:PUB00097203]]. WTF family includes diverse meiotic drivers and drive suppressors but they generally drive into >85% of gametes when heterozygous [[cite:PUB00097202]]. Wtf4, a member of the large Wtf family, encodes two different proteins: one that acts as a poison and one that acts as an antidote. The antidote remains inside the gametes that contain the wtf4 gene, while the poison is released in the surrounding environment and kills all the gametes that do not posses the antidote [[cite:PUB00086062]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03303" "WTF protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WTF family", "short" "WTF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 15, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 180, "sets" 0, "proteins" 142, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 134}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004982", :literature {"PUB00086062" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Nuckolls NL" "Bravo Nunez MA" "Eickbush MT" "Young JM" "Lange JJ" "Yu JS" "Smith GR" "Jaspersen SL" "Malik HS" "Zanders SE."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26033", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "wtf genes are prolific dual poison-antidote meiotic drivers.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28631612}, "PUB00086064" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Shropshire JD" "Rokas A."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28567", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "The gene family that cheats Mendel.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28631611}, "PUB00086063" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hu W" "Jiang ZD" "Suo F" "Zheng JX" "He WZ" "Du LL."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26057", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "A large gene family in fission yeast encodes spore killers that subvert Mendel's law.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28631610}, "PUB00097203" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Bravo Nunez MA" "Sabbarini IM" "Eide LE" "Unckless RL" "Zanders SE."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "Atypical meiosis can be adaptive in outcrossed <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> due to <i>wtf</i> meiotic drivers.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32790622}, "PUB00097202" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Bravo Nunez MA" "Sabbarini IM" "Eickbush MT" "Liang Y" "Lange JJ" "Kent AM" "Zanders SE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "Dramatically diverse Schizosaccharomyces pombe wtf meiotic drivers all display high gamete-killing efficiency.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "e1008350", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32032353}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0110134", "name" "meiotic drive", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004982", "name" "WTF family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 22}}}
