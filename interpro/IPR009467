{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family has a novel fold known as a spiral β-roll, consisting of a 15-stranded β sheet wrapped around a single α helix. It forms dimers. It has some structural similarity to the E. coli lipoprotein localisation factors LolA ([swissprot:P61316]) and LolB ([swissprot:P61320]). Its structure suggests that it may have a role in glycolipid binding. Its genomic context supports a role in glycolipid metabolism [[cite:PUB00057505]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2h1t", "name" "Crystal structure of a duf1089 family protein (pa1994) from pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1.80 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06475" "Putative glycolipid-binding"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative glycolipid-binding protein", "short" "Glycolipid-bd_prot_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 1124, "taxa" 4375, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4087, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4084, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3259}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009467", :literature {"PUB00057505" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 10", "authors" ["Bakolitsa C" "Kumar A" "McMullan D" "Krishna SS" "Miller MD" "Carlton D" "Najmanovich R" "Abdubek P" "Astakhova T" "Chiu HJ" "Clayton T" "Deller MC" "Duan L" "Elias Y" "Feuerhelm J" "Grant JC" "Grzechnik SK" "Han GW" "Jaroszewski L" "Jin KK" "Klock HE" "Knuth MW" "Kozbial P" "Marciano D" "Morse AT" "Nigoghossian E" "Okach L" "Oommachen S" "Paulsen J" "Reyes R" "Rife CL" "Trout CV" "van den Bedem H" "Weekes D" "White A" "Xu Q" "Hodgson KO" "Wooley J" "Elsliger MA" "Deacon AM" "Godzik A" "Lesley SA" "Wilson IA."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
