{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Topoisomerase II (called gyrase in bacteria) primarily introduces negative supercoils into DNA. In bacteria, topoisomerase II consists of two polypeptide subunits, gyrA and gyrB, which form a heterotetramer: (BA)2.

GyrA has two functional domains: an N-terminal that forms the covalent DNA-protein bridge that is responsible for the breaking- and rejoining function, and a C-terminal that can bind DNA non-specifically [[cite:PUB00020803]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>DNA topoisomerases regulate the number of topological links between two DNA strands (i.e. change the number of superhelical turns) by catalysing transient single-or double-strand breaks, crossing the strands through one another, then resealing the breaks [[cite:PUB00005437]].
