{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nuclear respiratory factor-1 is a transcriptional activator that has been implicated in the nuclear control of respiratory chain expression in vertebrates. The first 26 amino acids of nuclear respiratory factor-1 are required for the binding of dynein light chain. The interaction with dynein light chain is observed for both ewg and Nrf-1, transcription factors that are structurally and functionally similar between humans and Drosophila [[cite:PUB00044399]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Drosophila, the erect wing (ewg) protein is required for proper development of the central nervous system and the indirect flight muscles. The fly ewg gene encodes a novel DNA-binding domain that is also found in four genes previously identified in sea urchin, chicken, zebrafish, and human [[cite:PUB00044398]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highest level of expression of both ewg and Nrf-1 was found in the central nervous system, somites, first branchial arch, optic vesicle, and otic vesicle. In the mouse Nrf-1 protein, [swissprot:Q8C4C0], there is also an NLS domain at 88-116, and a DNA binding and dimerisation domain at 127-282. Ewg is a site-specific transcriptional activator, and evolutionarily conserved regions of ewg contribute both positively and negatively to transcriptional activity [[cite:PUB00044400]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR20338" "NUCLEAR RESPIRATORY FACTOR 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NRF1/Ewg family", "short" "NRF1/Ewg"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 821, "taxa" 3517, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2631, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2631, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1640}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039142", :literature {"PUB00044399" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Herzig RP" "Andersson U" "Scarpulla RC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
