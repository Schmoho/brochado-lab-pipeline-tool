{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents dimeric deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) ([ec:3.6.1.23]) and phage T4 dCTP pyrophosphatase ([ec:3.6.1.12]). dUTPase catalyses the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate. There are several classes of dUTPases: trimeric dUTPases found in most organisms and homologous monomeric dUTPases, found in mammalian herpesviruses. The dUTPases in this entry belong to a third class of dUTPases that form a dimer in solution and are able to hydrolyse both dUTP and dUDP [[cite:PUB00070194]]. It contains a novel all-α fold that is unrelated to the all-β fold found in dUTPases of the majority of organisms [[cite:PUB00032166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1w2y", "name" "The crystal structure of a complex of Campylobacter jejuni dUTPase with substrate analogue dUpNHp"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08761" "dUTPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "dUTPase/dCTP pyrophosphatase", "short" "dUTPase/dCTP_pyrophosphatase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 1039, "taxa" 4825, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5006, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4785, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3165}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
