{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a chromatin modifying complex that consists of three core components: EED, SUZ12 and one of the two histone H3K27 methyltransferases, EZH1 or EZH2 [[cite:PUB00077180]]. The PRC2 complex catalyses di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K37me2/3), which has a repressive role. Even though EZH1 and EZH2 form similar PRC2 complexes, they exhibit contrasting repressive roles. In terms of their expression in mice, EZH1 is more abundant in nonproliferative adult organs, while EZH2 expression is tightly associated with proliferation [[cite:PUB00077181]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5u5t", "name" "Crystal structure of EED in complex with H3K27Me3 peptide and 3-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-ylmethyl)piperidine-1-carboximidamide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11616" "WD repeat binding protein EZH2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH1/EZH2", "short" "EZH1/EZH2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 637, "taxa" 2147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3046, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3045, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1949}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
