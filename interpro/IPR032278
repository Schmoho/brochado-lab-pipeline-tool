{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs), produced by diverse pathogenic bacteria, are cyclomodulins that inhibit the eukaryotic host cell cycle and also hijack other key cellular processes such as those controlling the actin network and apoptosis [[cite:PUB00076252]]. It acts by mediating the side chain deamidation of 'Gln-40' of host NEDD8, converting it to glutamate, thereby abolishing the activity of cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes (CRL complexes). The hijacking of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway of host cells results in the modulation of various cellular functions such as epithelium renewal, apoptosis and immune response [[cite:PUB00076252], [cite:PUB00099575], [cite:PUB00099573], [cite:PUB00099574]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3efy", "name" "Structure of the Cyclomodulin Cif from Pathogenic Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16374" "Cycle inhibiting factor (CIF)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein-glutamine deamidase Cif", "short" "Cif"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 127, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 80, "sets" 0, "proteins" 80, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 61}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
