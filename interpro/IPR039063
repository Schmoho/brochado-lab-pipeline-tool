{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the CTP-dependent riboflavin kinase, found primarily in archaea, that catalyses the phosphorylation of riboflavin to form flavin mononucleotide in riboflavin biosynthesis. It uses CTP as the donor nucleotide. Its structure resembles a RIFT barrel, structurally similar to but topologically distinct from bacterial and eukaryotic examples [[cite:PUB00042719]]. The N-terminal is a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, and the C-terminal half is most similar in sequence to a group of cradle-loop barrels.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2vbu", "name" "Riboflavin kinase Mj0056 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii in complex with CDP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023465", "name" "Riboflavin kinase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40706" "RIBOFLAVIN KINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Riboflavin kinase, CTP-dependent", "short" "RibK_CTP-dep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 313, "taxa" 2364, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3051, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3051, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2563}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
