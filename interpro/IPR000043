{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenosylhomocysteinase (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, [ec:3.3.1.1]) (AdoHcyase) is an enzyme of the activated methyl cycle, responsible for the reversible hydration of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine into adenosine and homocysteine. This enzyme is ubiquitous, highly conserved, and may play a key role in the regulation of the intracellular concentration of adenosylhomocysteine. AdoHcyase requires NAD+ as a cofactor and contains a central glycine-rich region which is thought to be involved in NAD-binding. Since AdoHyc is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferases, AdoHycase plays a critical role in the modulation of the activity of various methyltransferases. The enzyme forms homotetramers, with each monomer binding one molecule of NAD+ [[cite:PUB00021119], [cite:PUB00038377], [cite:PUB00079516], [cite:PUB00079517]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family also includes S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like 1 (Ahcyl1), also known as IRBIT, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like protein 2 (Ahcyl2).

By competing with IP3, it modulates the threshold IP3 concentration required for the activation of the receptor [[cite:PUB00083401]]. Further studies indicate that Ahcyl1/IRBIT is in fact a multifunctional protein that regulates several ion channels and ion transporters [[cite:PUB00083432], [cite:PUB00083433]]. Despite its homology to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolases, Ahcyl1 has neither enzyme activity nor any effects on the enzyme activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase [[cite:PUB00083397]]. Ahcyl2 lacks binding activity to IP3R [[cite:PUB00083418]].
