{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of nuclear proteins that are conserved from nematodes to humans. They can form a helix-loop-helix motif and are related to, yet distinct from, the HMG-I/Y-like subfamily of HMG proteins. This entry includes two human nuclear proteins, NUPR1 (also known as p8) and NUPR2. Similar to several HMGs, NUPR1 binds DNA, however, it has a low affinity and poor sequence specificity for DNA binding [[cite:PUB00077984]]. NUPR1 is multifunctional protein that interacts with several partners to target different signalling pathways, such as the NUPR1/RELB/IER3 survival pathway [[cite:PUB00077983]] and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00077982]]. It also binds to and inhibits MSL1, a protein with 53BP1-dependent DNA-repair activity [[cite:PUB00077980]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17149" "NUCLEAR PROTEIN 1 AND 2"}, "pfam" {"PF10195" "DNA-binding nuclear phosphoprotein p8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear protein 1-like", "short" "NUPR1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 521, "taxa" 2476, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1127, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 747}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018792", :literature {"PUB00077980" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gironella M" "Malicet C" "Cano C" "Sandi MJ" "Hamidi T" "Tauil RM" "Baston M" "Valaco P" "Moreno S" "Lopez F" "Neira JL" "Dagorn JC" "Iovanna JL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
