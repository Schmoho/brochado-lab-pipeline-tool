{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Analysis of the metabolome of a number of methanogenic archaea revealed that they produced a number of unusual compounds of low molecular weight, one of which was cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (cDPG). This has been found to occur in several methanogens in high concentrations of up to 1 Molar. The highest intracellular concentrations of cDPG were detected in the hyperthermophilic methanogens Methanothermus fervidus (optimal growth temperature, 83 degrees C) and Methanopyrus kandleri (optimal growth temperature, 98 degrees C). Additionally, the intracellular concentration of cDPG increases with temperature up to the optimal growth temperature in M. fervidus. It has been proposed that cDPG is either used an energy store and/or is involved in the process of thermoadaption [[cite:PUB00053141]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00769" "2-phosphoglycerate kinase [pgk2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-phosphoglycerate kinase", "short" "2PKG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 33, "taxa" 247, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 208, "sets" 0, "proteins" 208, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 169}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
