{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP) 1 and 2 proteins. MAGP1 and 2 are components of elastic fibres. MAGP-1 has been proposed to bind a C-terminal region of tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin. MAGP-2 was found to interact with fibrillin-1 and -2, as well as fibulin-1, another component of elastic fibres. This suggests that MAGP-2 may be important in the assembly of microfibrils [[cite:PUB00011372]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05507" "Microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP)"}, "panther" {"PTHR16485" "MICROFIBRILLAR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Microfibril-associated glycoprotein", "short" "MAGP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 635, "taxa" 2141, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1949, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1270}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008673", :literature {"PUB00011372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Penner AS" "Rock MJ" "Kielty CM" "Shipley JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
