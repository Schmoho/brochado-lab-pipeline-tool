{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>S-bacillithiolation is the formation of mixed disulfide bonds between protein thiols and the general thiol reductant bacillithiol (BSH) under oxidative stress. BSH is an equivalent of glutathione (GSH) in Firmicutes [[cite:PUB00070742], [cite:PUB00070741], [cite:PUB00070740]].</p>\n\n<p>This protein family includes the bacilliredoxins BrxA and BrxB (previously known as YphP and YqiW, respectively) and uncharacterised proteins from bacteria. BrxA and BrxB debacillithiolate (remove BSH) the S-bacillithiolated OhrR (OhrR-SSB) and in vivo NaOCl-generated S-bacillithiolated MetE (MetE-SSB). Both proteins are involved in maintaining redox homeostasis in response to disulfide stress conditions [[cite:PUB00100774]]. The crystal structure of BrxA shows similarity with a thioredoxin fold. It has a CXC motif that plays a key role in catalytic activity [[cite:PUB00052908]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7rzb", "name" "BrxA from Staphylococcus aureus with bacillithiol mixed disulfide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40052" "UPF0403 PROTEIN YQIW-RELATED"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR04191" "BrxA/BrxB family bacilliredoxin"}, "pfam" {"PF06491" "Disulphide isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacilliredoxins BrxB/BrxA", "short" "BrxB/BrxA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 1444, "taxa" 4722, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6206, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6206, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4722}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0933", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0933"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009474", :literature {"PUB00052908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "36", "authors" ["Derewenda U" "Boczek T" "Gorres KL" "Yu M" "Hung LW" "Cooper D" "Joachimiak A" "Raines RT" "Derewenda ZS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi900437z", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Structure and function of Bacillus subtilis YphP, a prokaryotic disulfide isomerase with a CXC catalytic motif .", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "8664-71", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19653655}, "PUB00100774" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Gaballa A" "Chi BK" "Roberts AA" "Becher D" "Hamilton CJ" "Antelmann H" "Helmann JD."], "ISO_journal" "Antioxid Redox Signal", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Antioxid Redox Signal", "title" "Redox regulation in Bacillus subtilis: The bacilliredoxins BrxA(YphP) and BrxB(YqiW) function in de-bacillithiolation of S-bacillithiolated OhrR and MetE.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "357-67", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24313874}, "PUB00070740" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Chi BK" "Gronau K" "Mader U" "Hessling B" "Becher D" "Antelmann H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
