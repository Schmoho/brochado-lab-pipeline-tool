{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the archaeal oligosaccharyl transferases. Members of this protein family are found, one to three members per genome, in the same species of Euryarchaeota that contain the predicted protein-sorting enzyme archaeosortase and its cognate protein-sorting signal PGF-CTERM [[cite:PUB00060405]]. Oligosaccharyl transferase AglB (STT3) is responsible for transferring a pentasaccharide moiety to at least two S-layer glycoprotein sites in Haloferax volcanii [[cite:PUB00057883]]. Dolichyl-phosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase 3 (aglB3) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus is required for the first step in attaching an N-linked-carbohydrate to a newly-synthesized protein, by transfering a glycan from the lipid carrier dolichol-monophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif [[cite:PUB00090965]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04154" "oligosaccharyl transferase, archaeosortase A system-associated"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oligosaccharyl transferase, archaeal", "short" "OlisacTrfase_arch"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 161, "taxa" 967, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1010, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 892}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0978", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0978"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
