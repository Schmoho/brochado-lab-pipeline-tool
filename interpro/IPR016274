{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents eukaryotic histidine acid phosphatases, including Phytase A from Aspergillus oryzae (PhyA) and human Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1). PhyA catalyses the phosphate monoester hydrolysis of phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) with the subsequent formation of myo-inositol pentakis-, tetrakis-, tris-, bis-, and monophosphates, as well as the liberation of inorganic phosphate [[cite:PUB00153142]]. MINPP1 regulates intracellular inositol polyphosphates pools, which act as metal chelators, it may control the availability of intracellular calcium and iron, which are important for proper neuronal development and homeostasis [[cite:PUB00153140] , [cite:PUB00153141]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qwo", "name" "Crystal structure of a phosphorylated phytase from Aspergillus fumigatus, revealing the structural basis for its heat resilience and catalytic pathway"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029033", "name" "Histidine phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000894" "Acid phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine acid phosphatase, eukaryotic", "short" "Histidine_acid_Pase_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1855, "taxa" 6542, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6326, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3921}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
