{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant regulatory proteins, including NPR1-4 from Arabidopsis. NPR1 is a central regulator of salicylic-acid (SA)-mediated defense signaling in Arabidopsis. It contains a BTB/POZ domain at the N-terminal and an ankyrin-repeat domain in the central region. It binds to TGA1, a member of the TGA family of transcription factors that activate SA-responsive elements in the promoters of PR (PATHOGENESIS-RELATED) genes. It also has cytosolic function in cross-communication between SA- and JA-dependent defense signaling pathways [[cite:PUB00095755]]. NPR1 is functionally conserved in diverse plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa L.) [[cite:PUB00095756]]. NPR3 and NPR4 have also been shown to be required for basal defense against pathogens [[cite:PUB00095757], [cite:PUB00095758]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46475" "REGULATORY PROTEIN NPR3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Regulatory protein NPR", "short" "NPR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 241, "taxa" 1045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2031, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2031, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1298}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044292", :literature {"PUB00095757" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Liu G" "Holub EB" "Alonso JM" "Ecker JR" "Fobert PR."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "An Arabidopsis NPR1-like gene, NPR4, is required for disease resistance.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "304-18", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15634206}, "PUB00095758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Cheng YT" "Qu N" "Zhao Q" "Bi D" "Li X."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Negative regulation of defense responses in Arabidopsis by two NPR1 paralogs.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "647-56", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17076807}, "PUB00095756" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Yuan Y" "Zhong S" "Li Q" "Zhu Z" "Lou Y" "Wang L" "Wang J" "Wang M" "Li Q" "Yang D" "He Z."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Biotechnol J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Biotechnol J", "title" "Functional analysis of rice NPR1-like genes reveals that OsNPR1/NH1 is the rice orthologue conferring disease resistance with enhanced herbivore susceptibility.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "313-24", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17309686}, "PUB00095755" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Pieterse CM" "Van Loon LC."], "ISO_journal" "Curr Opin Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Curr Opin Plant Biol", "title" "NPR1: the spider in the web of induced resistance signaling pathways.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "456-64", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15231270}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009862", "name" "systemic acquired resistance, salicylic acid mediated signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:2000022", "name" "regulation of jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:2000031", "name" "regulation of salicylic acid mediated signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044292", "name" "Regulatory protein NPR", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
