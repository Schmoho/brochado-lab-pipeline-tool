{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents FMN-dependent NADH:quinone oxidoreductases (also known as FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductases) which function as quinone reductases that provides resistance to thiol-specific stress caused by electrophilic quinones [[cite:PUB00096690]]. These enzymes also exhibit azoreductase activity, catalysing the reductive cleavage of azo bond in aromatic azo compounds to the corresponding amines [[cite:PUB00049638], [cite:PUB00096689]]. They require NADH, as an electron donor for its activity. These enzymes are homodimers that binds one FMN molecule per subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6qu0", "name" "Structure of azoreductase from Bacillus sp.
