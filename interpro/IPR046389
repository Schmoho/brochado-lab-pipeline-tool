{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes sliding clamp protein from Bacteriophage T4 (also known as gp45), which encircles the genomic DNA and links the DNA polymerase to the template to control the processivity of DNA synthesis. It is responsible for tethering the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase to DNA during high-speed replication [[cite:PUB00100546]]. The interaction with the sliding-clamp-loader opens the sliding clamp so that it can be loaded around the DNA template [[cite:PUB00065743]]. During transcription, encircles the DNA and tethers host RNA polymerase (RNAP) to it [[cite:PUB00100539]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04161" "Sliding clamp"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sliding clamp", "short" "Sliding_clamp_T4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 166, "taxa" 1716, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1126, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 90}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046389", :literature {"PUB00065743" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6063", "authors" ["Kelch BA" "Makino DL" "O'Donnell M" "Kuriyan J."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1211884", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "How a DNA polymerase clamp loader opens a sliding clamp.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1675-80", "volume" "334", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22194570}, "PUB00100539" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Shi J" "Wen A" "Jin S" "Gao B" "Huang Y" "Feng Y."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Transcription activation by a sliding clamp.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "1131", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33602900}, "PUB00100546" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Latham GJ" "Dong F" "Pietroni P" "Dozono JM" "Bacheller DJ" "von Hippel PH."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Opening of a monomer-monomer interface of the trimeric bacteriophage T4-coded GP45 sliding clamp is required for clamp loading onto DNA.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "12448-53", "volume" "96", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10535942}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0030337", "name" "DNA polymerase processivity factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046389", "name" "Sliding clamp", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
