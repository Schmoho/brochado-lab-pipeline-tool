{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The YTH (YT521-B homology) domain has been suggested to be an evolutionarily conserved m6A-dependent RNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00077943]]. Proteins containing this domain includes mammalian YTHD and YTDC proteins, Arabidopsis CPSF30 (At1g30460), and budding yeast Pho92. These proteins recognise and bind N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs, and regulate their stability [[cite:PUB00077943], [cite:PUB00087331], [cite:PUB00155134], [cite:PUB00155133]]. YTHD acts as a regulator of mRNA stability by promoting degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex [[cite:PUB00155134]]. The YTHDF paralogues (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) shares m6A-containing mRNAs targets and act redundantly to mediate mRNA degradation and cellular differentiation [[cite:PUB00155134], [cite:PUB00155132]].</p>\n\n<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pho92 is a post-transcriptional regulator that regulates Pho4 mRNA stability by binding to the 3'-UTR in a phosphate-dependent manner. Its YTH domain exhibits RNA-binding activity [[cite:PUB00077942]]. Its orthologue from S. pombe, Mmi1, is an\nRNA-binding protein that recognises and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing RNAs, a modification present at internal sites of mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs. It functions alone and as part of the erh1-mmi1 complex, to recruit the CCR4-NOT complex and the NURS complex to target RNAs [[cite:PUB00093061], [cite:PUB00145523], [cite:PUB00094514]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5zuu", "name" "Crystal structure of AtCPSF30 YTH domain in complex with 10mer m6A-modified RNA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12357" "YTH YT521-B HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-CONTAINING"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YTH domain containing protein", "short" "YTH_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 158, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2388, "taxa" 8139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15930, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15930, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10053}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
