{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In higher plants, the growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) is found both free and conjugated via amide bonding to a variety of amino acids and peptides, and via an ester linkage to carbohydrates. IAA-Asp conjugates are involved in homeostatic control, protection, storing and subsequent use of free IAA. IAA-Asp is also found in some plants as a unique intermediate for entering into IAA non-decarboxylative oxidative pathway. IAA amidohydrolases, which belong to the M20 family of peptidases, cleave the amide bond between the auxin and the conjugated amino acid to regulate IAA levels [[cite:PUB00014873]].</p>\n\n<p>IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1 (IAA-LEUCINE RESISTANT 1) from Arabidopsis hydrolyses certain amino acid conjugates of IAA, including IAA-Phe, IAA-Leu and IAA-Tyr, although it can also use IAA-Ala, IAA-Gly, IAA-Met and IAA-Glu as substrates with lower efficiency, having no activity with IAA-Ile, IAA-1-O-beta-D-glucose or IAA-myo-inositol [[cite:PUB00014785], [cite:PUB00097005], [cite:PUB00097006]]. ILL4, also known as IAR3, hydrolyses IAA-Ala, IAA-Asn, IAA-Cys, IAA-Glu, IAA-Met, IAA-Ser and IAA-Gly [[cite:PUB00097005], [cite:PUB00014873]] and has a lower efficiency with IAA-Phe, IAA-Leu and IAA-Val and no activity with IAA-Ile [[cite:PUB00097005], [cite:PUB00014873]]. ILL4 also hydrolyses amino acid conjugates of jasmonic acid and 12-hydroxy jasmonic acid [[cite:PUB00097007]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes ILR1 and ILR1-like proteins (ILL) from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q43", "name" "Ensemble refinement of the protein crystal structure of IAA-aminoacid hydrolase from Arabidopsis thaliana gene At5g56660"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08017" "M20 Peptidase Indole-3-acetic acid amino acid hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like", "short" "ILR1-like_Hyd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 258, "taxa" 1019, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2733, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2702, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1533}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
