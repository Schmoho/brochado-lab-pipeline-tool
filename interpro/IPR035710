{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the archaeal-type gltB proteins. Proteins in this entry share sequence similarity with a region of unknown function found in the large subunit of glutamate synthase, which is encoded by gltB and found in most bacteria and eukaryotes. It is predicted to be homologous to the C-terminal domain of glutamate synthase based upon sequence similarity coupled with genome organization data, showing that this protein is found in a gene cluster with other proteins of Glts, which are annotated. Proteins in this entry are found in archaea, but are also present in a few bacteria, likely as a result of lateral gene transfer [[cite:PUB00015710]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036485", "name" "Glutamate synthase, alpha subunit, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00981" "arch_gltB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Archaeal gltB", "short" "Archaeal_gltB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 168, "taxa" 1269, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 935, "sets" 0, "proteins" 935, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 777}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035710", :literature {"PUB00015710" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Nesbo CL" "L'Haridon S" "Stetter KO" "Doolittle WF."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
