{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The NRL (for NPH3/RPT2-Like) family is formed by signaling molecules specific\nto higher plants. Several regions of sequence and predicted structural\nconservation define members of the NRL family, with three domains being most\nnotable: an N-terminal BTB domain, a centrally located NPH3\ndomain, and a C-terminal coiled coil domain. The function of the NPH3 domain\nis not yet known [[cite:PUB00007452], [cite:PUB00007451], [cite:PUB00063929], [cite:PUB00063930], [cite:PUB00063931], [cite:PUB00063932], [cite:PUB00063933], [cite:PUB00063934]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Root phototropism protein 3 (RPT3), also known as nonphototropic hypocotyl 3 (NPH3), and root phototropism 2 (RPT2) represent the founding members of a novel plant-specific family [[cite:PUB00063933]]. Three domains define the members of this family: an N-terminal BTB (broad complex, tramtrack, bric a brac) domain ([interpro:IPR000210]), a centrally located NPH3 domain ([interpro:IPR027356]), and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.</p>\n\n<p>NPH3 assembles with CUL3 to form a E3 complex that ubiquitinates phototropin 1 (phot1) and modulates phototropic responsiveness [[cite:PUB00071372], [cite:PUB00063934]]. NPH3 is necessary for root and hypocotyl phototropisms, but not for the regulation of stomata opening or chloroplast relocation [[cite:PUB00063929]]. Coleoptile phototropism protein 1 (CPT1) is a rice orthologue of Arabidopsis NPH3 also required for phototropism [[cite:PUB00063930]]. This entry also includes DOT3 (AT5G10250) that is involved in shoot and primary root growth; DOT3 mutants produce an aberrant parallel venation pattern in juvenile leaves [[cite:PUB00072439]]. Also included is SR1IP1 that acts as a positive regulator of plant defense by removing the defense suppressor CAMTA3/SR1 by acting as a substrate adapter that recruits CAMTA3/SR1 for ubiquitination and degradation during pathogen infection [[cite:PUB00154515]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32370" "OS12G0117600 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NPH3/RPT2-like family", "short" "NPH3/RPT2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 335, "taxa" 1342, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15895, "sets" 0, "proteins" 15895, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9413}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043454", :literature {"PUB00063934" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Roberts D" "Pedmale UV" "Morrow J" "Sachdev S" "Lechner E" "Tang X" "Zheng N" "Hannink M" "Genschik P" "Liscum E."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.087999", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Modulation of phototropic responsiveness in Arabidopsis through ubiquitination of phototropin 1 by the CUL3-Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL3(NPH3).", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "3627-40", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21990941}, "PUB00071372" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Gingerich DJ" "Gagne JM" "Salter DW" "Hellmann H" "Estelle M" "Ma L" "Vierstra RD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
