{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases which are characterised by three conserved sequence motifs [[cite:PUB00003337]]. It includes pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase YjjG from E. coli, pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase PynA from Streptococcus pneumoniae and the uncharacterised protein YfnB from B. subtilis. YjjG and PynA have been shown to act as house-cleaning enzymes, cleaving nucleotides with non-canonical nucleotide bases that protect cells against non-canonical pyrimidine derivatives such as 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), and prevents the incorporation of potentially mutagenic nucleotides such as 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (5-BrdU) into DNA. They are strictly specific to pyrimidine substrates with 5'-monophosphates and shows no activity against nucleoside di- and triphosphates [[cite:PUB00070801], [cite:PUB00097232]]. By virtue of an α helical domain in-between the first and second conserved motif, this family is a member of subfamily IA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3qnm", "name" "Haloalkane Dehalogenase Family Member from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron of Unknown Function"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02254" "noncanonical pyrimidine nucleotidase, YjjG family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD-superfamily hydrolase, subfamily IA, YjjG/PynA", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IA_YjjG/PynA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1869, "taxa" 8197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9132, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9132, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6805}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
