{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a small collection of probable metallophosphoresterases, related to [pfam:PF00149] but with long inserts separating some of the shared motifs such that the homology is apparent only through multiple sequence alignment. Members of this protein family, in general, have a Sec-independent TAT (twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence, N-terminal to the region modeled by this HMM. Members include YP_056203.1 from Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03767" "TIGR03767 family metallophosphoesterase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metallophosphoesterase, PPA1498", "short" "Metallophosphoesterase_PPA1498"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 432, "taxa" 1300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1288, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1288, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 966}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022506", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022506", "name" "Metallophosphoesterase, PPA1498", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
