{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry contain between eight and ten predicted transmembrane regions and are thought to function as transporters. The best characterised of these proteins is PecM ([swissprot:P42194]) from Erwinia chrysanthemi. PecM is an integral membrane protein which influences the activity of the virulence regulator PecS, and appears to be necessary for the complete efflux of blue pigment indigoidine [[cite:PUB00034473], [cite:PUB00034474]]. This entry also includes some proteins predicted to be amino acid metabolite efflux pumps, and several proteins for which no functional predictions have been made.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00950" "carboxylate/amino acid/amine transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carboxylate/Amino Acid/Amine Transporter", "short" "CO/AA/NH_transpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 303, "taxa" 2659, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3384, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3384, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2596}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004779", :literature {"PUB00034473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Praillet T" "Reverchon S" "Robert-Baudouy J" "Nasser W."], "ISO_journal" "FEMS Microbiol.
