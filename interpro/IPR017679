{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the beta subunit of coenzyme F420 hydrogenase (FRH) ([ec:1.12.98.1]) found exclusively and universally in methanogenic archaea [[cite:PUB00009571]]. Active coenzyme F420 hydrogenase forms a heterocomplex of three subunits: alpha ([interpro:IPR017682]), beta and gamma ([interpro:IPR017681]). This enzyme reduces the physiological low-potential two-electron acceptor coenzyme F420, and the artificial one-electron acceptor methylviologen. The enzyme complex is tightly associated with the redox cofactors: nickel, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and iron-sulphur cluster (2-13 Fe atoms per alpha/beta/gamma unit of the FRH) [[cite:PUB00044647]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4omf", "name" "The F420-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase complex from Methanothermobacter marburgensis, the first X-ray structure of a group 3 family member"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03289" "coenzyme F420 hydrogenase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coenzyme F420 hydrogenase subunit beta, archaea", "short" "FrhB_archaea"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 49, "taxa" 338, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 262}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0723", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0723"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
