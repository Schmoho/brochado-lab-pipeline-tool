{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents plasmid replication initiator RepA from the incFII (plasmid incompatibility group F-II) plasmids. This group of plasmids includes R1 and R100. Immediately upstream of repA is found tap, which encodes a leader peptide of about 24 amino acids, often not assigned as a gene in annotated plasmid sequences. Note that other, non-homologous plasmid replication proteins share the gene symbol (repA) and similar names (eg plasmid replication protein RepA).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03474" "incFII family plasmid replication initiator RepA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plasmid replication initiator, RepA, IncFII type", "short" "Plasmid_rep_init_RepA_IncFII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 375, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 874, "sets" 0, "proteins" 874, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 722}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017837", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003446", "name" "Plasmid replication initiation, RepA", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017837", "name" "Plasmid replication initiator, RepA, IncFII type", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
