{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA carries the biological information that instructs cells how to exist in an ordered fashion. Accurate replication is thus one of the most important events in the cell life cycle. This function is mediated by DNA-directed DNA-polymerases, which add nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) residues to the 5'-end of the growing DNA chain, using a complementary DNA as template. Small RNA molecules are generally used as primers for chain elongation, although terminal proteins may also be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNA-dependent DNA-polymerases have been grouped into families, denoted A, B and X, on the basis of sequence similarities [[cite:PUB00004647], [cite:PUB00004955]]. Members of family A, which includes bacterial and bacteriophage polymerases, share significant similarity to Escherichia coli polymerase I; hence family A is also known as the pol I family. The bacterial polymerases also contain an exonuclease activity, which is coded for in the N-terminal portion. The yeast gamma polymerases show some similarity to the prokaryotic nuclear polymerases of family A, but their function is restricted to mitochondrial DNA replication and repair [[cite:PUB00002437]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10267" "DNA POLYMERASE SUBUNIT GAMMA-1"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000797" "DNA-directed DNA polymerase, mitochondrial type"}, "prints" {"PR00867" "DNAPOLG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed DNA-polymerase, family A, mitochondria", "short" "DNA-dir_DNA_pol_A_mt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2063, "taxa" 6797, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5428, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3969, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2185}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
