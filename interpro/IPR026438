{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme, known also as GGGP synthase and GGGPS, is a prenyltransferase that catalyses the transfer of the geranylgeranyl moiety of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to the C3 hydroxyl of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P). It catalyses the stereospecific first step in the biosynthesis of the characteristic membrane diether lipids of archaea. To a much lesser extent, is also able to use heptaprenyl pyrophosphate (HepPP; 35 carbon atoms) as the prenyl donor. Interestingly, the closest homologues outside this family are not the functionally equivalent enzymes of other archaea, but rather functionally distinct bacterial enzymes [[cite:PUB00060473], [cite:PUB00040561]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2f6u", "name" "Crystal Structure of (S)-3-O-Geranylgeranylglyceryl Phosphate Synthase complexed with citrate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038597", "name" "GGGP/HepGP synthase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04146" "phosphoglycerol geranylgeranyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase, archaea", "short" "GGGP_synthase_archaea"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 205, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 150, "sets" 0, "proteins" 150, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 124}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
