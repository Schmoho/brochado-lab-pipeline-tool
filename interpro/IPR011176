{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents receptors of complement activation (RCA), including B5, also known as Protein OPG190, and Complement control protein C3 from Vaccinia virus. B5 binds complement components C3 and C1q [[cite:PUB00090989]]. This protein plays a role in the dissolution of the outermost membrane of extracellular enveloped virions (EV) to allow virion entry into host cells. Participates also in wrapping mature virions (MV) to form enveloped virions (EV) [[cite:PUB00103675], [cite:PUB00103674]].  C3 is involved in modulating the host inflammatory response by blocking both classical and alternative pathways of complement activity through its ability to bind host complement components C3b and C4b (complement 3b and 4b, respectively) [[cite:PUB00014548], [cite:PUB00103673]]. By blocking complement activation at multiple sites, these proteins can down-regulate pro-inflammatory chemotactic factors (C3a, C4a, and C5a), resulting in reduced cellular influx and inflammation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF002486" "Complement control protein, vaccinia C3L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Complement control protein C3/B5", "short" "CCP_VACV_C3/B5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 141, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 232, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011176", :literature {"PUB00014548" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Smith SA" "Sreenivasan R" "Krishnasamy G" "Judge KW" "Murthy KH" "Arjunwadkar SJ" "Pugh DR" "Kotwal GJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
