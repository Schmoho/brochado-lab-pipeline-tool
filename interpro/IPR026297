{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes both FMRFamide-related peptides and growth hormone-releasing peptides.</p>\n\n<p>FMRFamide-related peptides are neurotransmitters, hormone-like substances and tumor suppressor peptides [[cite:PUB00060750]]. Neuropeptide RFRP-1 acts as a potent negative regulator of gonadotropin synthesis and secretion. Neuropeptides NPSF and NPVF efficiently inhibit forskolin-induced production of cAMP, but RFRP-2 shows no inhibitory activity. Neuropeptide NPVF blocks morphine-induced analgesia. FMRFamide-related peptides may act in concert with kisspeptin, through opposing affects, to regulate the activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons across the seasons, leading to an annual change in fertility and the cyclical seasonal transition from non-breeding to breeding season [[cite:PUB00060362], [cite:PUB00060363], [cite:PUB00060364]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14403" "RFAMIDE PEPTIDE GONADOTROPIN INHIBITORY HORMONE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FMRFamide-related peptide/Growth hormone-releasing peptide", "short" "FMRFamide-related/fGRP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 583, "taxa" 2022, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 787, "sets" 0, "proteins" 787, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 582}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026297", :literature {"PUB00060363" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Clarke IJ" "Sari IP" "Qi Y" "Smith JT" "Parkington HC" "Ubuka T" "Iqbal J" "Li Q" "Tilbrook A" "Morgan K" "Pawson AJ" "Tsutsui K" "Millar RP" "Bentley GE."], "ISO_journal" "Endocrinology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/en.2008-0575", "medline_journal" "Endocrinology", "title" "Potent action of RFamide-related peptide-3 on pituitary gonadotropes indicative of a hypophysiotropic role in the negative regulation of gonadotropin secretion.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "5811-21", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18617613}, "PUB00060362" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Smith JT" "Coolen LM" "Kriegsfeld LJ" "Sari IP" "Jaafarzadehshirazi MR" "Maltby M" "Bateman K" "Goodman RL" "Tilbrook AJ" "Ubuka T" "Bentley GE" "Clarke IJ" "Lehman MN."], "ISO_journal" "Endocrinology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/en.2008-0581", "medline_journal" "Endocrinology", "title" "Variation in kisspeptin and RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) expression and terminal connections to gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the brain: a novel medium for seasonal breeding in the sheep.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "5770-82", "volume" "149", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18617612}, "PUB00060364" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kimmel CB" "Miller CT" "Kruze G" "Ullmann B" "BreMiller RA" "Larison KD" "Snyder HC."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
