{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the matrix protein M from negative-strand Bornaviridae viruses (BDV-M). Its most stable oligomeric form is a tetramer, and it lies beneath the viral envelope where it associates with the inner layer of the viral membrane. It bridges the gap between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope thereby imparting structural integrity and individual form to the virus particle. Borna disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic enveloped RNA virus causing a noncytolytic, persistent infection of the central nervous system in mammals. The order to which this virus belongs, Mononegavirales, also contains the Ebola, mumps, rabies and measles viruses, amongst other highly infectious agents [[cite:PUB00050078]].</p>\n\n<p>Structural studies on this protein have shown that heterologously expressed BDV-M co-purifies with and protects ssRNA oligonucleotides taken up from the expression host. This has revealed the ability of BDV-M to bind RNA and lipid membranes simultaneously, thus expanding the repertoire of M-protein functionalities [[cite:PUB00052882]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038520", "name" "Matrix protein superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16520" "ssRNA-binding matrix protein of Bornaviridae"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Matrix protein, Bornaviridae", "short" "BDV_M"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 46, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 302, "sets" 0, "proteins" 302, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032414", :literature {"PUB00050078" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Day PJ" "Cleasby A" "Tickle IJ" "O'Reilly M" "Coyle JE" "Holding FP" "McMenamin RL" "Yon J" "Chopra R" "Lengauer C" "Jhoti H."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
