{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These are a family of small (about 115 amino acids) uncharacterised proteins with N-terminal signal sequences, found predominantly in Gram-positive organisms. Most genomes that have any members of this family have at least two members. This entry includes YxeA from Bacillus subtilis, which  gene is located in operon encoding the ABC transporter structural genes YxdJKLM.  YxeA is transcriptionally regulated by YxdJ [[cite:PUB00062417]]. It is predicted to participate in antibiotic resistance mechanism as an immunity peptide interacting with and neutralising antibiotic.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036166", "name" "YxeA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06486" "Protein of unknown function (DUF1093)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01655" "YxeA family protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR36433" "HYPOTHETICAL CYTOSOLIC PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1093", "short" "DUF1093"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 316, "taxa" 1582, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3765, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3765, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2434}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006542", :literature {"PUB00062417" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 8", "authors" ["Joseph P" "Guiseppi A" "Sorokin A" "Denizot F."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.27155-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Characterization of the Bacillus subtilis YxdJ response regulator as the inducer of expression for the cognate ABC transporter YxdLM.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "2609-17", "volume" "150", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15289557}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006542", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF1093", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 45, "alignment:full" 482}}}
