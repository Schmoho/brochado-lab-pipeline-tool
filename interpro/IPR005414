{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The type III secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria is used to transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell [[cite:PUB00003585]] and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with the host. Effector proteins secreted by the type III system do not possess a secretion signal, and are considered unique because of this. Salmonella spp. secrete an effector protein called SopE that is responsible for stimulating the reorganisation of the host cell actin cytoskeleton, and ruffling of the cellular membrane [[cite:PUB00007792]]. It acts as a guanyl-nucleotide-exchange factor on Rho-GTPase proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac. As it is imperative for the bacterium to revert the cell back to its \"normal\" state as quickly as possible, another tyrosine phosphatase effector called SptP reverses the actions brought about by SopE [[cite:PUB00007793]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035949", "name" "SopE-like, GEF domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF034781" "Guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SopE type"}, "prints" {"PR01593" "SOPEPROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine nucleotide exchange factor SopE", "short" "SopE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 328, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2167, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1013, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 946}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005414", :literature {"PUB00003585" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Hueck CJ."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
