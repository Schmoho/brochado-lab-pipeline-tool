{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, a member of the family short-chain-alcohol dehydrogenases. Note that, despite the precision implied by the enzyme name, the reaction of  [ec:1.1.1.36]  is defined more generally as (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NADP+ = 3-oxoacyl-CoA + NADPH. Members of this family may act in the biosynthesis of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (e.g. Rhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti)) and related poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoates.
