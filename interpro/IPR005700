{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins are part of a large genetic locus which is associated with exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00017617], [cite:PUB00088289]]. This entry includes ExoP from Rhizobium meliloti and PssP from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii. They belong to the PCP2a family involved in the synthesis of high-molecular-weight EPS [[cite:PUB00088291]]. They contain a periplasmic domain flanked by two transmembrane regions and an additional cytoplasmic domain. ExoP is involved in polymerization and secretion of succinoglycan. Mutations in the Walker A ATP-binding motif found in the cytoplasmic domain of ExoP prevented ATPase activity of the ExoP protein [[cite:PUB00088290]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01005" "exopolysaccharide transport protein family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein ExoP-like", "short" "EPS_ExoP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 297, "taxa" 1422, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1823}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
