{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry respresents S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent tRNA 4-demethylwyosine synthase Tyw1 from eukaryotes and archaea. They are involved in the pathway wybutosine-tRNA(Phe) biosynthesis. It binds one [4Fe-4S] cluster and one  [2Fe-2S] cluster. The [4Fe-4S] cluster is coordinated with three cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine [[cite:PUB00050155], [cite:PUB00031322]]. The two carbon source required for this reaction has been identified as pyruvate. The exact role of the SAM molecule has yet to be determined. There appear to be two distinct sets of proteins with different multi-domain architectures, however they are sufficiently similar in the Radical SAM portion that they remain a single cluster [[cite:PUB00083703]].</p>\n\n<p>Wybutosine is a hyper modified guanosine with a tricyclic base found at the 3'-position adjacent to the anticodon of eukaryotic phenylalanine tRNA. It is important for translational reading-frame maintenance [[cite:PUB00044611]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6pup", "name" "1.9 A crystal structure of flavodoxin-like domain of Schizosaccharomyces japonicus putative tRNAPhe 4-demethylwyosine synthase Tyw1 in complex with FMN"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00284" "tRNA wybutosine-synthesizing"}, "panther" {"PTHR13930" "S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE-DEPENDENT TRNA 4-DEMETHYLWYOSINE SYNTHASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent tRNA 4-demethylwyosine synthase", "short" "tRNA_wybutosine-synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2205, "taxa" 8602, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6908, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6867, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4973}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
