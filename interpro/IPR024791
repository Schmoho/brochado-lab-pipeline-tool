{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:7.1.1.9]) is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain of mitochondria and many aerobic bacteria. It catalyses the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen:</p>\n\n<p><reaction> 4 cytochrome c<sup>+2</sup> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> --> 4 cytochrome c<sup>+3</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O</reaction></p>\n\n<p>This reaction is coupled to the pumping of four additional protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane [[cite:PUB00006599], [cite:PUB00033207]].</p>\n\n<p>Cytochrome c oxidase is an oligomeric enzymatic complex that is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane of eukaryotes and in the plasma membrane of aerobic prokaryotes. The core structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase contains three common subunits, I, II and III. In prokaryotes, subunits I and III can be fused and a fourth subunit is sometimes found, whereas in eukaryotes there are a variable number of additional small polypeptidic subunits [[cite:PUB00006600]]. The functional role of subunit III is not yet understood.</p>\n\n<p>As the bacterial respiratory systems are branched, they have a number of distinct terminal oxidases, rather than the single cytochrome c oxidase present in the eukaryotic mitochondrial systems. Even though the cytochrome o complex oxidises quinol (ubiquinol) and does not catalyse the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c, they belong to the same haem-copper oxidase superfamily as cytochrome c oxidases. Members of this family share sequence similarities in all three core subunits: subunit I is the most conserved subunit, whereas subunit II is the least conserved [[cite:PUB00006601], [cite:PUB00006602], [cite:PUB00002253]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7w3e", "name" "Bovine cytochrome c oxidese in CN-bound fully reduced state at 50 K"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013833", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit III, 4-helical bundle", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR035973", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit III-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11403" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit III", "short" "Cyt_c/ubiquinol_Oxase_su3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 163, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7433, "taxa" 74565, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 88056, "sets" 0, "proteins" 88056, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 71006}, "pathways" 38}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0614", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0614"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
