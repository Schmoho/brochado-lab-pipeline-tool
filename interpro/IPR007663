{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Baculoviruses are distinct from other virus families in that there are two viral phenotypes: budded virus (BV) and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). BVs disseminate viral infection throughout the tissues of the host and ODVs transmit baculovirus between insect hosts.  In the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, p74 (also known as per os infectivity factor 0) is important for attachment to the host caterpillar midgut and fusion by binding to a specific host receptor [[cite:PUB00082602], [cite:PUB00082603]].   P74 is anchored in the ODV envelope by a C-terminal transmembrane anchor domain and is N-terminally exposed on the ODV surface [[cite:PUB00082604]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04583" "Baculoviridae p74 conserved region"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baculoviridae p74", "short" "Baculo_p74"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 113, "taxa" 487, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 299, "sets" 0, "proteins" 298, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007663", :literature {"PUB00082604" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 4", "authors" ["Slack JM" "Lawrence SD" "Krell PJ" "Arif BM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
