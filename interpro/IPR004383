{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the RlmN family, that includes dual-specificity RNA methyltransferase RlmN and ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase Cfr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dual-specificity RNA methyltransferase RlmN specifically methylates position 2 of adenine 2503 in 23S rRNA [[cite:PUB00046147]]. This nucleotide is located in a functionally important region of the ribosome, at the entrance to the nascent peptide exit tunnel, and may thus be involved in the interaction with the nascent peptide. It also methylates position 2 of adenine 37 in tRNAs. Unmodified tRNA is not a suitable substrate for RlmN, which suggests that RlmN works in a late step during tRNA maturation [[cite:PUB00046147], [cite:PUB00064728], [cite:PUB00064729]].</p>\r\n<p>Ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase Cfr specifically methylates position 8 of adenine 2503 in 23S rRNA. It can also methylate position 2 of A2503 after the primary methylation is complete, to form 2,8-dimethyladenosine. Cfr confers antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The antibiotic resistance is provided by methylation at the 8 position and is independent of methylation at the 2 position of A2503 [[cite:PUB00017347], [cite:PUB00064730]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fz6", "name" "Crystal Structure of a radical SAM methyltransferase from Sphaerobacter thermophilus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00275" "adenosine C2 methyltransferase (RlmN-like)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006004" "Predicted radical SAM enzyme, Cfr type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase RlmN/Cfr", "short" "rRNA_lsu_MTrfase_RlmN/Cfr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9125, "taxa" 34890, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42514, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42371, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32161}, "pathways" 146}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
