{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family represent the alpha subunit of the multifunctional enzyme complex of the fatty acid degradation cycle, which plays a minor role in aerobic beta-oxidation of fatty acids [[cite:PUB00017800]]. The FadJI complex is necessary for anaerobic growth on short-chain acids with nitrate as an electron acceptor. Activities include: enoyl-CoA hydratase ([ec:4.2.1.17]), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.35]), and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase ([ec:5.1.2.3]). Dehydrogenase activity results in the conversion of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> [[cite:PUB00088374]]. A representative is the Escherichia coli FadJ protein (also named YfcX) ([swissprot:P77399]).
