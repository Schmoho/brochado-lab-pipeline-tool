{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents transporter proteins that are primarily involved in the uptake of thiosulfate, a sulfur-containing oxyanion. Members of this family are characterised by their ability to mediate the transport of thiosulfate across the cellular membrane, which is essential for sulfur metabolism in various organisms  [[cite:PUB00057481]]. The proteins have an hourglass-shaped architecture, which facilitates the binding and translocation of thiosulfate [[cite:PUB00155410]]. The positively charged outer concave side of these transporters is likely involved in the initial interaction with thiosulfate ions [[cite:PUB00155410]]. Proteins in this family contains several conserved glycines and an invariant cysteine that is probably an important functional residue.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30574" "INNER MEMBRANE PROTEIN YEDE"}, "pfam" {"PF04143" "Sulphur transport"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphur transport TsuA/YedE", "short" "Sulf_transp_TsuA/YedE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 5451, "taxa" 21549, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38185, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35554, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26661}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007272", :literature {"PUB00057481" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Gristwood T" "McNeil MB" "Clulow JS" "Salmond GP" "Fineran PC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
