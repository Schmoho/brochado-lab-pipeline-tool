{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.49]) (G6PDH) is a ubiquitous protein, present in bacteria and all eukaryotic cell types [[cite:PUB00001763]]. The enzyme catalyses the the first step in the pentose pathway, i.e. the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to gluconolactone 6-phosphate in the presence of NADP, producing NADPH. The ubiquitous expression of the enzyme gives it a major role in the production of NADPH for the many NADPH-mediated reductive processes in all cells, and is critical for NADPH homeostasis and redox regulation [[cite:PUB00097192]]. Deficiency of G6PDH is a common genetic abnormality affecting millions of people worldwide. Many sequence variants, most caused by single point mutations, are known, exhibiting a wide variety of phenotypes with the distinctive one being chronic and drug- or food-induced hemolytic anemia, attributed to the inability to produce NADPH and withstand harmful oxidants in erythrocyte cells [[cite:PUB00097192], [cite:PUB00097191]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6jyu", "name" "Crystal structure of Human G6PD Canton"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00966" "Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase [zwf]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000110" "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase"}, "panther" {"PTHR23429" "GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE 1-DEHYDROGENASE G6PD"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00871" "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase"}, "prints" {"PR00079" "G6PDHDRGNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase", "short" "G6P_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 53, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9186, "taxa" 36230, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48937, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48428, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36241}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00067", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00067"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1691", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1691"} {"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"} {"accession" "GenProp1520", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1520"} {"accession" "GenProp1502", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1502"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
