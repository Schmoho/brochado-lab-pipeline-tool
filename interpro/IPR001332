{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arterivirus such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) contain four glycoproteins on the virion envelope: the major glycoprotein GP5 and minor glycoproteins GP2a, GP3, and GP4. GP5, previously known as Gl, is encoded in ORF5 and is 30- 45kDa in size [[cite:PUB00005612]]. Gl is heterogeneously glycosylated with N-acetyllactosamine in a cell-type-specific manner.
