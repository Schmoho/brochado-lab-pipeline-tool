{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of metallopeptidases belong to MEROPS peptidase family M24 (clan MG), subfamily M24A.</p>\n\n<p>Methionine aminopeptidase ([ec:3.4.11.18]) (MAP) catalyses the hydrolytic cleavage of the N-terminal methionine from newly synthesised polypeptides if the penultimate amino acid is small, with different tolerance to Val and Thr at this position [[cite:PUB00070140]]. All MAP studied to date are monomeric proteins that require cobalt ions for activity. Two subfamilies of MAP enzymes are known to exist [[cite:PUB00004871], [cite:PUB00005454]]. While being evolutionary related, they only share a limited amount of sequence similarity mostly clustered around the residues shown, in the Escherichia coli MAP [[cite:PUB00000379]], to be involved in cobalt-binding. The first family consists of enzymes from prokaryotes as well as eukaryotic MAP-1 ([interpro:IPR002467]), while the second group is made up of archaeal MAP and eukaryotic MAP-2 [[cite:PUB00017444]] and includes proteins which do not seem to be MAP, but that are clearly evolutionary related such as mouse proliferation-associated protein 1 and fission yeast curved DNA-binding protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8oxg", "name" "Crystal structure of human methionine aminopeptidase-2 complexed with (3R,4S,5S,6R)-5-methoxy-4-[(2R,3R)-2-methyl-3-(3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl)-2-oxiranyl]-1-oxaspiro[2.5]oct-6-yl N-(trans-4-aminocyclohexyl)carbamate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036005", "name" "Creatinase/aminopeptidase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01088" "MetAP2"}, "hamap" {"MF_03175" "Methionine aminopeptidase 2 [METAP2]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00501" "type II methionyl aminopeptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M24A, methionine aminopeptidase, subfamily 2", "short" "Pept_M24A_MAP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2859, "taxa" 10994, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8733, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6151}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00575", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00575"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1491", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1491"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
