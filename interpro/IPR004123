{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents fission yeast Dim1 and its homologues, including Dib1 from budding yeasts, YLS8 from plants and TXNL4 from animals. Dim1 was originally identified as a mitosis protein [[cite:PUB00075149]]. Later, it was found to interact with spliceosome component Prp6, which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00075151]]. Dim1 may act at the level of mRNA, which impacts the functioning of the APC/C, a critical complex in controlling mitotic progression [[cite:PUB00075152]].</p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that although the Dim proteins exhibit a thioredoxin-like fold, they lack the disulfide bond required for the thioredoxin redox activity [[cite:PUB00075153]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qgv", "name" "HUMAN SPLICEOSOMAL PROTEIN U5-15KD"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02954" "DIM1"}, "smart" {"SM01410" "Mitosis protein DIM1"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017199" "Thioredoxin-like protein, 4A/4B type"}, "panther" {"PTHR12052" "THIOREDOXIN-LIKE PROTEN 4A, 4B"}, "pfam" {"PF02966" "Mitosis protein DIM1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dim1 family", "short" "Dim1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 43, "domain_architectures" 116, "proteomes" 2647, "taxa" 9053, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6234, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6221, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4155}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004123", :literature {"PUB00075151" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang Y" "Lindblom T" "Chang A" "Sudol M" "Sluder AE" "Golemis EA."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(00)00372-3", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Evidence that dim1 associates with proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and delineation of residues essential for dim1 interactions with hnRNP F and Npw38/PQBP-1.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "33-43", "volume" "257", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11054566}, "PUB00075152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Carnahan RH" "Feoktistova A" "Ren L" "Niessen S" "Yates JR 3rd" "Gould KL."], "ISO_journal" "Eukaryotic Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.4.3.577-587.2005", "medline_journal" "Eukaryot Cell", "title" "Dim1p is required for efficient splicing and export of mRNA encoding lid1p, a component of the fission yeast anaphase-promoting complex.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "577-87", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15755920}, "PUB00075153" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Simeoni F" "Divita G."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
