{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including protein ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 4 (EDR4) from Arabidopsis. EDR4 plays a negative role in resistance to powdery mildew. It localizes at the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. It interacts with EDR1 and recruits EDR1 to the fungal penetration site, where it regulates defense responses. It also interacts with CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN2 (CHC2) and edr4 mutants show reduced endocytosis [[cite:PUB00090747]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31105" "EXTRA-LARGE G-PROTEIN-LIKE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein enhanced disease resistance 4-like", "short" "EDR4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 256, "taxa" 974, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2634, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2634, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1547}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040244", :literature {"PUB00090747" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wu G" "Liu S" "Zhao Y" "Wang W" "Kong Z" "Tang D."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.114.134668", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE4 associates with CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN2 and modulates plant immunity by regulating relocation of EDR1 in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "857-73", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25747881}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:1900150", "name" "regulation of defense response to fungus", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040244", "name" "Protein enhanced disease resistance 4-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
