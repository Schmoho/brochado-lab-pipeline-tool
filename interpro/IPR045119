{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN)-domain proteins are inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins that are part of bridging complexes linking cytoskeletal elements with the nucleoskeleton. Originally identified based on an ~150-amino acid region of homology between the C terminus of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Sad1 protein and the Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-84 protein, SUN proteins are present in the proteomes of most eucaryotes. In addition to the SUN domain, these proteins contain a transmembrane sequence and at least one coiled-coil domain and localise to the inner nuclear envelope. SUN proteins are anchored in the inner nuclear envelope by their transmembrane segment and oriented in the membrane such that the C-terminal SUN domain is located in the space between the inner and outer nuclear membrane. Here, the SUN domain can interact with the C-terminal tail of an outer nuclear envelope protein that binds to the cytoskeleton, including the centrosome [[cite:PUB00057231], [cite:PUB00072664], [cite:PUB00072665]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6wmd", "name" "Human Sun2-KASH4 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12911" "SAD1/UNC-84-LIKE PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SUN domain-containing protein 1-5", "short" "SUN1-5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2437, "taxa" 8344, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9839, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9839, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6320}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045119", :literature {"PUB00072664" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Jaspersen SL" "Martin AE" "Glazko G" "Giddings TH Jr" "Morgan G" "Mushegian A" "Winey M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
