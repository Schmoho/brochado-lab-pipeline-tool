{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lon protease belongs to the S16 peptidase family and is an ATP-dependent serine protease that mediates the selective degradation of mutant and abnormal proteins, as well as certain short-lived regulatory proteins. It is required for cellular homeostasis and for survival from DNA damage and developmental changes induced by stress [[cite:PUB00062807]]. In pathogenic bacteria, it is required for the expression of virulence genes that promote cell infection [[cite:PUB00062804]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lon (La) protease was the first ATP-dependent protease to be purified from\r\nE. coli [[cite:PUB00000452], [cite:PUB00002455], [cite:PUB00001838], [cite:PUB00002806]]. The enzyme is a homotetramer of 87kDa subunits, with one proteolytic and one ATP-binding site per monomer, making it structurally less complex than other known ATP-dependent proteases [[cite:PUB00002455]]. Despite this relative structural simplicity, Lon recognises its substrates directly, without delegating the task of substrate recognition to other enzymes [[cite:PUB00002455]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qzm", "name" "alpha-domain of ATPase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43718" "LON PROTEASE", "PTHR10046" "ATP DEPENDENT LON PROTEASE FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lon protease", "short" "Lon_Prtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 105, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11496, "taxa" 44759, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 86410, "sets" 0, "proteins" 86410, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64623}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
