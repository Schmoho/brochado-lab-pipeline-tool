{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). This BGC (BGC0001397) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic classes, NRP (non-ribosomal peptide) and polyketide. This family includes a protein from the lidamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces globisporus C-1027 and appears to be predominantly present in bacteria [[cite:PUB00099385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19522" "Family of unknown function (DUF6052)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6052", "short" "DUF6052"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 14, "taxa" 78, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36, "sets" 0, "proteins" 36, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046115", :literature {"PUB00099385" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Li X" "Lei X" "Zhang C" "Jiang Z" "Shi Y" "Wang S" "Wang L" "Hong B."], "ISO_journal" "J Biotechnol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biotechnol", "title" "Complete genome sequence of Streptomyces globisporus C-1027, the producer of an enediyne antibiotic lidamycin.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "9-10", "volume" "222", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26853480}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046115", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6052", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 16}}}
