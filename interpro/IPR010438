{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Bacteriophage lambda Bor and Escherichia coli Iss proteins. Expression of bor significantly increases the survival of the E. coli host cell in animal serum. This property is a well known bacterial virulence determinant. Indeed, bor and its adjacent sequences are highly homologous to the iss serum resistance locus of the plasmid ColV2-K94, which confers virulence in animals. It has been suggested that lysogeny may generally have a role in bacterial survival in animal hosts, and perhaps in pathogenesis [[cite:PUB00012311]].</p>\r\n<p>Bor and Iss have been shown to be present on the outer membrane of E. coli,  where they may be recognised by the host's immune system [[cite:PUB00056866]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06291" "Bor protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bor", "short" "Lambda_Bor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 197, "taxa" 1687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1585, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1585, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1148}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010438", :literature {"PUB00056866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lynne AM" "Skyberg JA" "Logue CM" "Nolan LK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
