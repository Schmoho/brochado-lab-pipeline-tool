{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Meiosis regulator and mRNA stability factor 1 (also known as meiosis arrest female protein 1, MARF1, or Limkain-b1) was first identified as a novel peroxisomal autoantigen that co-localizes with a subset of cytoplasmic microbodies marked by ABCD3  [[cite:PUB00056072]]. Later, it was found that it is an essential regulator of oogenesis required for female meiotic progression and retrotransposon surveillance, therefore, involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. It acts as a RNAse that efficiently cleaves ssRNAs and down-regulates RNA transcripts, either at transcriptional or post-transcriptional level [[cite:PUB00068036], [cite:PUB00098862]]. It may function both as an adaptor to recruit specific RNA targets and an effector to catalyse the specific cleavages of target RNAs. MARF1 consists of three major domains, the N-terminal NYN domain, two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal repeat of LOTUS (also known as OST-HTH) domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fdl", "name" "Crystal structure of the NYN domain of human MARF1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14379" "LIMKAIN B LKAP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Meiosis regulator and mRNA stability factor 1", "short" "Marf1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1245, "taxa" 4747, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6948, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6948, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3183}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024768", :literature {"PUB00068036" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6075", "authors" ["Su YQ" "Sugiura K" "Sun F" "Pendola JK" "Cox GA" "Handel MA" "Schimenti JC" "Eppig JJ."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1214680", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "MARF1 regulates essential oogenic processes in mice.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1496-9", "volume" "335", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22442484}, "PUB00098862" {"URL" nil, "issue" "44", "authors" ["Yao Q" "Cao G" "Li M" "Wu B" "Zhang X" "Zhang T" "Guo J" "Yin H" "Shi L" "Chen J" "Yu X" "Zheng L" "Ma J" "Su YQ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Ribonuclease activity of MARF1 controls oocyte RNA homeostasis and genome integrity in mice.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "11250-11255", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30333187}, "PUB00056072" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Dunster K" "Lai FP" "Sentry JW."], "ISO_journal" "Clin.
