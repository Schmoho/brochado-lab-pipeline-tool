{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains several eukaryotic transmembrane proteins which are related to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-50 [swissprot:Q10045]. A mammalian homologue, UNCL is a novel inner nuclear membrane protein that associates with RNA and is involved in the cell-surface expression of neuronal nicotinic receptors. UNCL plays a broader role because UNCL homologues are present in two yeast and a plant species, none of which express nicotinic receptors and it is also found in tissues that lack nicotinic receptors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05216" "UNC-50 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12841" "PROTEIN UNC-50 HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UNC-50", "short" "UNC-50"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 60, "proteomes" 2113, "taxa" 7713, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3898, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3712, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2534}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007881", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007881", "name" "UNC-50", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 86, "alignment:full" 2246}}}
