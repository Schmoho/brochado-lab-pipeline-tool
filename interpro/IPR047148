{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes 85/88 kDa calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (PLPL9/PNPLA9, also known as Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 9, PLA2G6 (phospholipase A2 group VI) or iPLA2beta) and related animal sequences. PNPLA9 is a Ca-independent phospholipase that catalyses the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position, being involved in phospholipid remodelling with implications in cellular membrane homeostasis, mitochondrial integrity and signal transduction. It is stimulated by ATP and inhibited by bromoenol lactone (BEL). In humans, PNPLA9 in expressed ubiquitously and is involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, and apoptotic cell death. It plays a critical role in membrane homeostasis.</p>\n\n<p>Mutations in human PNPLA9 leads to infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) [[cite:PUB00102030], [cite:PUB00102029], [cite:PUB00102031]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24139" "CALCIUM-INDEPENDENT PHOSPHOLIPASE A2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "85/88 kDa calcium-independent phospholipase A2", "short" "PLPL9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 974, "taxa" 3875, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3251, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3251, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2024}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
