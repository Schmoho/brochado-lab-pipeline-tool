{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents one of the unusual clades within the MarR family of transcription factors that bind Zn2 and regulate the response to zinc abundance or scarcity. This entry includes adhesin competence regulator AdcR (also known as ZitR in Lactococcus lactis [swissprot:A2RNS2]) that represses the transcription of a high-affinity zinc-specific uptake transporter, a group of surface antigen zinc-binding pneumococcal histidine triad proteins (PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, and PhtE), and an AdcA homologue (AdcAII). The Zn2-bound AdcR structure forms a mainly helical two-fold-symmetric dimer with two distinct metal-binding sites per protomer [pdbe:3TGN] [[cite:PUB00105664]].</p>\n\n<p>AdcR differs from other members of the MarR family in two important ways: AdcR has a unique effector in Zn2, and co-repression mechanism induced by metal binding that is unprecedented in MarR family transcriptional regulators [[cite:PUB00151200], [cite:PUB00151202], [cite:PUB00151201]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5yhy", "name" "Structure of Lactococcus lactis ZitR, C30S mutant"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038251" "zinc-dependent MarR family transcriptional regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adhesin competence regulator AdcR-like", "short" "AdcR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 52, "taxa" 380, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 483, "sets" 0, "proteins" 483, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 392}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047894", :literature {"PUB00151201" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Llull D" "Son O" "Blanie S" "Briffotaux J" "Morello E" "Rogniaux H" "Danot O" "Poquet I."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Lactococcus lactis ZitR is a zinc-responsive repressor active in the presence of low, nontoxic zinc concentrations in vivo.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1919-29", "volume" "193", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21317326}, "PUB00151202" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Shafeeq S" "Kloosterman TG" "Kuipers OP."], "ISO_journal" "Metallomics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Metallomics", "title" "Transcriptional response of Streptococcus pneumoniae to Zn2+) limitation and the repressor/activator function of AdcR.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "609-18", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21603707}, "PUB00151200" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Reyes-Caballero H" "Guerra AJ" "Jacobsen FE" "Kazmierczak KM" "Cowart D" "Koppolu UM" "Scott RA" "Winkler ME" "Giedroc DP."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "The metalloregulatory zinc site in Streptococcus pneumoniae AdcR, a zinc-activated MarR family repressor.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "197-216", "volume" "403", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20804771}, "PUB00105664" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["Guerra AJ" "Dann CE 3rd" "Giedroc DP."], "ISO_journal" "J Am Chem Soc", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Am Chem Soc", "title" "Crystal structure of the zinc-dependent MarR family transcriptional regulator AdcR in the Zn(II)-bound state.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "19614-7", "volume" "133", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22085181}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003700", "name" "DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047894", "name" "Adhesin competence regulator AdcR-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
