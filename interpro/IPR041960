{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the beta subunit (α6 - α6 barrel fold) of geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I)-like proteins containing the protein prenyltransferase (PTase) domain. GGTase-I is a subgroup of the protein prenyltransferase family of lipid-modifying enzymes PTases, which catalyze the carboxyl-terminal lipidation of Ras, Rab, and several other cellular signal transduction proteins, facilitating membrane associations and specific protein-protein interactions. Prenyltransferases employ a Zn2+ ion to alkylate a thiol group catalyzing the formation of thioether linkages between cysteine residues at or near the C terminus of protein acceptors and the C1 atom of isoprenoid lipids (geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) in the case of GGTase-I) [[cite:PUB00080785]]. GGTase-I prenylates the cysteine in the terminal sequence, 'CAAX' when X is Leu or Phe. Substrates for GTTase-I include the gamma subunit of neural G-proteins and several Ras-related G-proteins [[cite:PUB00080785], [cite:PUB00080792]]. PTases are heterodimeric with both alpha and beta subunits required for catalytic activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3dra", "name" "Candida albicans protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I complexed with GGPP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008930", "name" "Terpenoid cyclases/protein prenyltransferase alpha-alpha toroid", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02895" "GGTase-I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Geranylgeranyl transferase type-1 subunit beta", "short" "GGTase_I_beta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1018, "taxa" 4266, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1714, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1714, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1042}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
