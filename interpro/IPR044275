{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), including KRP1-7 (Kip-related proteins 1-7) from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00095705]].</p>\n\n<p>Plant CKIs fall into 2 distinct families, KIP-RELATED PROTEINS (KRPs) and SIAMESE-RELATED proteins (SMRs). KRPs share very little sequence similarity with mammalian KIP proteins outside the C-terminal conserved region. Compare to mammalian CKIs, plant KRP1-KRP7 bind to active cyclin D2 (CYCD2)/CDKA and CYCD2/CDKB complexes to a similar extent, however, they inhibit kinase activity to a different extent [[cite:PUB00095706]]. KRPs function as a dose-dependent cell cycle inhibitors and have an important function in cell proliferation as well as in cell cycle exit and in turning from a mitotic to an endoreplicating cell cycle mode [[cite:PUB00095710]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46776" "CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 4-RELATED"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017811" "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, plant", "short" "KRP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 245, "taxa" 963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2810, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2784, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1640}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044275", :literature {"PUB00095705" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6624", "authors" ["Wang H" "Fowke LC" "Crosby WL."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A plant cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "451-2", "volume" "386", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9087400}, "PUB00095706" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Nakai T" "Kato K" "Shinmyo A" "Sekine M."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Arabidopsis KRPs have distinct inhibitory activity toward cyclin D2-associated kinases, including plant-specific B-type cyclin-dependent kinase.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "336-40", "volume" "580", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16376885}, "PUB00095710" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Weinl C" "Marquardt S" "Kuijt SJ" "Nowack MK" "Jakoby MJ" "Hulskamp M" "Schnittger A."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Novel functions of plant cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, ICK1/KRP1, can act non-cell-autonomously and inhibit entry into mitosis.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1704-22", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15749764}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0004861", "name" "cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045736", "name" "negative regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0051726", "name" "regulation of cell cycle", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044275", "name" "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
