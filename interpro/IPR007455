{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Serglycin was first identified as an intracellular proteoglycan expressed by hematopoietic cells. All inflammatory cells highly synthesize serglycin and store it in granules, where it interacts with numerous inflammatory mediators, such as proteases, chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors. Later serglycin was found to be expressed by various non-hematopoietic cell types, such as tumour cells. Serglycin promotes the aggressive phenotype of tumours and confers resistance against drugs and complement system attack [[cite:PUB00088979]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human serglycin consists of a small core protein containing eight serine/glycine repeats. Each serine of this repeat region is a potential GAG attachment site [[cite:PUB00088980]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04360" "Serglycin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serglycin", "short" "Serglycin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 527, "taxa" 1777, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 681, "sets" 0, "proteins" 673, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 497}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007455", :literature {"PUB00088980" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Schick BP."], "ISO_journal" "Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/S1877-1173(10)93011-1", "medline_journal" "Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci", "title" "Serglycin proteoglycan deletion in mouse platelets: physiological effects and their implications for platelet contributions to thrombosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and metastasis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "235-87", "volume" "93", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20807648}, "PUB00088979" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Korpetinou A" "Skandalis SS" "Labropoulou VT" "Smirlaki G" "Noulas A" "Karamanos NK" "Theocharis AD."], "ISO_journal" "Front Oncol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2013.00327", "medline_journal" "Front Oncol", "title" "Serglycin: at the crossroad of inflammation and malignancy.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "327", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24455486}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007455", "name" "Serglycin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 15, "alignment:full" 561}}}
