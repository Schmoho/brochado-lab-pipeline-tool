{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the FOG (Friend of GATA) family, whose members are zinc finger cofactors that regulate GATA factor-activated gene transcription. There are two FOG proteins in mammals, FOG1 and FOG2. They are essential cofactors that act via the formation of a heterodimer with transcription factors of the GATA family GATA1, GATA2 and GATA3 [[cite:PUB00090047]]. In mice, FOG1 is expressed predominantly within the hematopoietic system, while FOG2 is expressed outside of blood, mostly in heart, brain, gonads, and liver [[cite:PUB00090047]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes the FOG homologue from fruit flies, U-shaped (Ush), which is expressed in circulating and lymph gland hemocytes, where it plays a critical role in controlling blood cell proliferation and differentiation [[cite:PUB00090048]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12958" "FRIEND OF GATA2-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FOG family", "short" "FOG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 892, "taxa" 4175, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3249, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3249, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2109}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039746", :literature {"PUB00090047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cantor AB" "Orkin SH."], "ISO_journal" "Semin.
