It suppresses chaperone-associated misfolded protein aggregation and toxicity [[cite:PUB00098242]]. MGRN1 interacts with cytosolic prion proteins (PrPs) that are linked with neurodegeneration\n [[cite:PUB00098243]]. It also interacts with expanded polyglutamine proteins, and suppresses misfolded polyglutamine aggregation and cytotoxicity. Moreover, MGRN1 inhibits melanocortin receptor signaling by competition with Galphas, suggesting a novel pathway for melanocortin signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus [[cite:PUB00098239]]. Furthermore, MGRN1 interacts with and ubiquitylates TSG101, a key component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-I, and regulates endosomal trafficking. A null mutation in the gene encoding MGRN1 causes spongiform neurodegeneration, suggesting a link between dysregulation of endosomal trafficking and spongiform neurodegeneration [[cite:PUB00098240], [cite:PUB00098241]].</p>\n\n<p>RNF157 is a cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase predominantly expressed in brain. In cultured neurons, it promotes neuronal survival in an E3 ligase-dependent manner. In contrast, it supports growth and maintenance of dendrites independent of its E3 ligase activity. RNF157 interacts with and ubiquitinates the adaptor protein APBB1 (amyloid beta precursor protein-binding, family B, member 1 or Fe65), which regulates neuronal survival, but not dendritic growth downstream of RNF157. The nuclear localization of APBB1 together with its interaction partner RNA-binding protein SART3 (squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 3 or Tip110) is crucial to trigger apoptosis [[cite:PUB00098244]]. Both MGRN1 and RNF157 contain a modified C3HC5-type RING-HC finger, and a functionally uncharacterized region, known as domain associated with RING2 (DAR2), N-terminal to the RING finger.</p>\n\n<p>In Arabidopsis, LOG2 is a predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase that interact with GDU1 and is involved in the regulation of amino acid export from plant cells [[cite:PUB00090853]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22996" "MAHOGUNIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MGRN1/RNF157-like", "short" "MGRN1/RNF157-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1731, "taxa" 6757, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7185, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7185, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4479}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
