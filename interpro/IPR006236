{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (PGDH) have at least two different structural domains: the nucleotide binding and the substrate binding. There are three types of PGDH: type 3 enzymes are composed only of these two domains, type2 enzymes contain an extra C-terminal regulatory domain (ACT domain), type 1 enzymes contain both the regulatory domain and an extra allosteric domain [[cite:PUB00069764], [cite:PUB00032650]]. This entry represents the type 1 enzyme. Interestingly, this type of PGDH is found in bacteria such as Mycobacterium, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium, plants such as Arabidopsis, and higher order eukaryotes, including mammals. The PGDHs from  E. coli and some lower eukaryotes, such as yeast and Neurospora, belong to the type2 PGDH and are not included in this entry [[cite:PUB00032650]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01327" "phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase", "short" "PGDH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5891, "taxa" 21047, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20823, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20823, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15620}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1640", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1640"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
