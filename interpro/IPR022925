{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents NAD-capped RNA hydrolase NudC from bacteria. NudC is a mRNA decapping enzyme that specifically removes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cap from a subset of mRNAs by hydrolysing the diphosphate linkage to produce nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and 5' monophosphate mRNA. This enzyme has preference for mRNAs with a 5'-end purine and catalyses the hydrolysis of a broad range of dinucleotide pyrophosphates. NudC assemblies into a homodimer with the appearance of a butterfly. Each monomer shows two tandem Nudix-fold domains, a N-terminal and a C-terminal, and an extended zinc-binding motif in-between. As a subgroup of the Nudix hydrolase family, NudC has a conserved Nudix motif [[cite:PUB00100519], [cite:PUB00095660]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7e44", "name" "Crystal structure of NudC complexed with dpCoA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015797", "name" "NUDIX hydrolase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00297" "NAD-capped RNA hydrolase NudC [nudC]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NAD-capped RNA hydrolase NudC", "short" "RNA_Hydrolase_NudC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 401, "taxa" 3210, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3257, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3257, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2523}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
