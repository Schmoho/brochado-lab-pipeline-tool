{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are found in a three-gene operon in Bacillus anthracis and related Bacillus species, where the other two genes are clearly identified with maturation of a putative thiazole-containing bacteriocin precursor. While there is no detectable pairwise sequence similarity between members of this family and the proposed cyclodehydratases such as SagC of Streptococcus pyogenes (see family [ncbifam:TIGR03603]), both families show similarity through PSI-BLAST to ThiF, a protein involved in biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety for thiamine biosynthesis. This family, therefore, may contribute to cyclodehydratase function in heterocycle-containing bacteriocin biosyntheses. In Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, the bacteriocin precursor gene is adjacent to the gene for this protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03693" "putative thiazole-containing bacteriocin maturation protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative thiazole-containing bacteriocin maturation protein", "short" "Thiazole_bacteriocin_mat_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 147, "taxa" 500, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 573, "sets" 0, "proteins" 573, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 369}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022368", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022368", "name" "Putative thiazole-containing bacteriocin maturation protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
