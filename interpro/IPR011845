{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes the coenzyme PQQ (pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone) biosynthesis protein PqqC. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is the prosthetic group of several bacterial enzymes, including methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and the glucose dehydrogenase of a number of bacteria [[cite:PUB00010477]]. PQQC is an oxidase whose reaction involves a ring closure and eight-electron oxidation of its substrate (AHQQ) to produce PQQ [[cite:PUB00088860]].
