{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is one of several factors that form part of a transcription pre-initiation complex along with RNA polymerase II, the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors, on the TATA-box sequence upstream of the initiation start site. After initiation, some components of the pre-initiation complex (including TFIIA) remain attached and re-initiate a subsequent round of transcription. TFIIA binds to TBP to stabilise TBP binding to the TATA element. TFIIA also inhibits the cytokine HMGB1 (high mobility group 1 protein) binding to TBP [[cite:PUB00013248]], and can dissociate HMGB1 already bound to TBP/TATA-box.</p>\r\n<p>Human and Drosophila TFIIA have three subunits: two large subunits, LN/alpha and LC/beta, derived from the same gene, and a small subunit, S/gamma. Yeast TFIIA has two subunits: a large TOA1 subunit that shows sequence similarity to the N-terminal of LN/alpha and the C-terminal of LC/beta, and a small subunit, TOA2 that is highly homologous with S/gamma. The conserved regions of the large and small subunits of TFIIA combine to form two domains: a four-helix bundle (helical domain) composed of two helices from each of the N-terminal regions of TOA1 and TOA2 in yeast; and a β-barrel (β-barrel domain) composed of β-sheets from the C-terminal regions of TOA1 and TOA2 [[cite:PUB00013320]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the gamma subunit of transcription factor TFIIA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1nh2", "name" "Crystal structure of a yeast TFIIA/TBP/DNA complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009088", "name" "Transcription factor IIA, beta-barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009083", "name" "Transcription factor IIA, alpha-helical domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF009415" "Transcription initiation factor IIA, gamma subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR10966" "TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION FACTOR IIA SUBUNIT 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation factor IIA, gamma subunit", "short" "TFIIA_gsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 84, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2388, "taxa" 8275, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4427, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4417, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2863}, "pathways" 58}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003194", :literature {"PUB00013248" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Dasgupta A" "Scovell WM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
