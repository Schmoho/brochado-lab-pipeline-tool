{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes immune protein Tsi2 (also known as Anti-toxin protein Tsi2) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and similar sequences predominantly found in proteobacteria. Tsi2 is a immunity protein that plays a role in preventing early activation of toxin Tse2, which is transported via the type VI secretion system (T6SS). It binds to a large surface of Tse2 and thereby occludes the active site to specifically inhibit Tse2. Tsi2 forms a dimeric structure. Each monomer consists of two large Î±-helices arranged as an anti-parallel coiled-coil connected by a short turn ([pdbe:3STQ]) [[cite:PUB00059442], [cite:PUB00081267], [cite:PUB00091403]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rq9", "name" "Structure of Tsi2, a Tse2-immunity protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053756", "name" "Toxin-specific immunity effector", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21643" "T6SS, Immune protein Tsi2-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T6SS, Immune protein Tsi2-like", "short" "T6SS_Tsi2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 118, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 53, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049070", :literature {"PUB00081267" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zou T" "Yao X" "Qin B" "Zhang M" "Cai L" "Shang W" "Svergun DI" "Wang M" "Cui S" "Jin Q."], "ISO_journal" "J.
