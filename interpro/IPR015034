Bles03 shows a two-layer sandwich architecture with a a nine-stranded β-sheet, three α-helices on each side and one solvent-exposed amino-terminal α-helix [[cite:PUB00039014]]. This protein has been suggested to have phosphothreonine lyase activity and to play a role in the biosynthesis of dehydro amino acids [[cite:PUB00100679]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023398", "name" "Translation Initiation factor eIF- 4e-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08939" "Basophilic leukemia-expressed protein Bles03"}, "panther" {"PTHR31977" "UPF0696 PROTEIN C11ORF68"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Basophilic leukemia-expressed protein Bles03-like", "short" "Bles03"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 41, "proteomes" 1228, "taxa" 4325, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2334, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1411}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015034", :literature {"PUB00039014" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 9", "authors" ["Bitto E" "Bingman CA" "Robinson H" "Allard ST" "Wesenberg GE" "Phillips GN Jr."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
