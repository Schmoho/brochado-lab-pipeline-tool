{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of proteins found in several proteobacteria, which are part of the CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system), providing immunity against bacteriophage. This system is ancestry related with the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway in animals. CBASS systems are composed of an oligonucleotide cyclase and an effector that is activated by the cyclic oligonucleotides, promoting cell death. The CD-NTase protein synthesises cyclic nucleotides in response to infection, which serve as specific second messenger signals that activate a diverse range of effectors, leading to bacterial cell death and thus abortive phage infection [[cite:PUB00096653], [cite:PUB00096608]].</p>\n\n<p>cGAS isopeptidase, also known as CD-NTase-associated protein 3 (CAP3), is part of type II CBASS, which is an isopeptidase of the JAB/JAMM family, a group of deubiquitinase enzymes that remove ubiquitin from target proteins. This protein is necessary for the protection against some phage infection suggesting its ancillary function in CBASS system [[cite:PUB00153173]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF028170" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP028170 type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02256" "conserved hypothetical protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CD-NTase-associated protein 3", "short" "CAP3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 53, "sets" 0, "proteins" 53, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 39}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011952", :literature {"PUB00096608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Millman A" "Melamed S" "Amitai G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "Diversity and classification of cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling systems.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "1608-1615", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32839535}, "PUB00096653" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7780", "authors" ["Cohen D" "Melamed S" "Millman A" "Shulman G" "Oppenheimer-Shaanan Y" "Kacen A" "Doron S" "Amitai G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Cyclic GMP-AMP signalling protects bacteria against viral infection.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "691-695", "volume" "574", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31533127}, "PUB00153173" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7956", "authors" ["Jenson JM" "Li T" "Du F" "Ea CK" "Chen ZJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05862-7", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Ubiquitin-like conjugation by bacterial cGAS enhances anti-phage defence.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "326-331", "volume" "616", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36848932}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR011952", "name" "CD-NTase-associated protein 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
