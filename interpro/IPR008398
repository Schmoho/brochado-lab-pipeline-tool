{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of sequences contains the 40kDa polypeptides from garlic viruses (Allexiviruses), which do not resemble any other plant virus gene products reported so far [[cite:PUB00011537]].</p>\r\n\r\nRod-shaped flexuous viruses have been isolated from garlic plants, Allium sativum. Infection by this virus creates typical mosaic symptoms. The core-like sequence of a zinc finger protein preceded by a cluster of basic amino acid residues shows similarities to the corresponding 12K proteins of the potexviruses and carlaviruses [[cite:PUB00011537]]. Viral epidemics by allexiviruses are also known to be caused by aphids and eriophyid mites (Aceria tulipae) carrying Potyviruses, Carlaviruses, and Allexiviruses [[cite:PUB00043798]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005512" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP005512 type"}, "pfam" {"PF05549" "Allexivirus 40kDa protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Allexivirus 40kDa", "short" "Allexi_40kDa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 36, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 193, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008398", :literature {"PUB00011537" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sumi S" "Tsuneyoshi T" "Furutani H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
