{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents RNA ligase 1 from animals (RLIG1), which functions as an RNA ligase in vitro [[cite:PUB00151146]]. This protein catalyses ATP-dependent RNA ligation via a three-step mechanism, involving tandem auto- and RNA AMPylation. It exhibits selectivity for single-stranded RNA substrates and may not have nick-sealing activity on double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids [[cite:PUB00151146]]. RLIG1 May play a role in maintaining RNA integrity under stress conditions, for example in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) [[cite:PUB00151146]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17720" "RNA ligase 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR31219" "CHROMOSOME 28 C12ORF29 HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA ligase 1", "short" "RLIG1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 438, "taxa" 2001, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 920, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 552}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
