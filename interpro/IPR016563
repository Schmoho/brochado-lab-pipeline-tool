{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Npl4 forms the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, which is a segregase complex that is involved in several ubiquitin-related processes. By coupling the ubiquitin-binding properties of Ufd1-Npl4 with the ATPase activity of Cdc48 (p97 in mammals), Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 is believed to aid in the extraction of ubiquitylated proteins from higher order complexes [[cite:PUB00077106]]. It also plays a role in the regulated destruction of resident ER membrane proteins [[cite:PUB00077110]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6jwj", "name" "Npl4 in complex with Ufd1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF010052" "Polyubiquitin-tagged protein recognition complex, Npl4 component"}, "panther" {"PTHR12710" "NUCLEAR PROTEIN LOCALIZATION 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear protein localization protein 4", "short" "Npl4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2634, "taxa" 8986, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5585, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5460, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3610}, "pathways" 23}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016563", :literature {"PUB00077110" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Heo JM" "Livnat-Levanon N" "Taylor EB" "Jones KT" "Dephoure N" "Ring J" "Xie J" "Brodsky JL" "Madeo F" "Gygi SP" "Ashrafi K" "Glickman MH" "Rutter J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
