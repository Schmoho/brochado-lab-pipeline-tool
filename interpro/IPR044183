{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of plant FKBP-type peptidylprolyl isomerases, including photosynthetic NDH subunit of lumenal location 4 (PNSL4, also known as FKBP16-2, At4g39710), FKBP13 and related proteins. In Arabidopsis, FKBP16-2 is localized to the lumen side of the thylakoid and may be an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex subunit specific to chloroplasts [[cite:PUB00095465]]. FKBP13 shows significant sequence similarity to PNSL4 [[cite:PUB00083728]]. It interacts with the Rieske Fe-S subunit of the cytochrome b6f complex [[cite:PUB00046703]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1u79", "name" "Crystal structure of AtFKBP13"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046357", "name" "Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47833" "PHOTOSYNTHETIC NDH SUBUNIT OF LUMENAL LOCATION 4, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosynthetic NDH subunit of lumenal location 4/FKBP13-like", "short" "PNSL4/FKBP13-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 282, "taxa" 1308, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1084, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1084, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 678}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
