{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The vaccinia virus F12L gene encodes a 65kDa protein called Protein OPG056 that is expressed late during infection and is important for plaque formation, EEV production and virulence. The F12L protein is located on intracellular enveloped virus (IEV) particles, but is absent from immature virions, intracellular mature virus and cell-associated enveloped virus. F12L shows co-localization with endosomal compartments and microtubules and appears to play a role in the the transport of IEV particles to the cell surface on microtubules. Together with protein OPG064/E2, forms a complex that interacts with host KLC2 (kinesin light chain isoform 2) to engage the kinesin-1 complex and thereby promote IEV trafficking [[cite:PUB00007237], [cite:PUB00103568], [cite:PUB00103567]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015793" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, VAC_EEV type"}, "pfam" {"PF03337" "Poxvirus F12L protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus F12L", "short" "Poxvirus_F12L"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 222, "sets" 0, "proteins" 222, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005005", :literature {"PUB00007237" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["van Eijl H" "Hollinshead M" "Rodger G" "Zhang WH" "Smith GL."], "ISO_journal" "J.
