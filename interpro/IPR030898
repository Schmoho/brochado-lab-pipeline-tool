{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a bifunctional aminotransferase that catalyses the first and third steps in the three-step conversion of arginine to beta-methylarginine. It first converts arginine to 2-ketoarginine, then converts 3-methyl-2-ketoarginine to 3-methylarginine. Genes that encode proteins in this family are found to be next to a 2-ketoarginine methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.243]) [[cite:PUB00074194], [cite:PUB00074195]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015424", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015421", "name" "Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase, major domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04544" "beta-methylarginine biosynthesis bifunctional aminotransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-methylarginine biosynthesis bifunctional aminotransferase", "short" "3metArgNH2trans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 74, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1098", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1098"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
