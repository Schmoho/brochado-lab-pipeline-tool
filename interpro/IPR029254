It has been suggest that MRFAP1 competes with MRGBP for binding to MORF4L1, thereby regulating MORF4L1 function in chromatin modification [[cite:PUB00069946]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15155" "MORF4 family-associated protein1"}, "panther" {"PTHR31324" "MORF4 FAMILY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MORF4 family-associated protein 1", "short" "MRFAP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 118, "taxa" 419, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 335, "sets" 0, "proteins" 334, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 223}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029254", :literature {"PUB00069946" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Larance M" "Kirkwood KJ" "Xirodimas DP" "Lundberg E" "Uhlen M" "Lamond AI."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
