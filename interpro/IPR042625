{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2), also known as VE-JAM or JAM-B, is a type I integral membrane protein that contains two Ig-like folds and three N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain [[cite:PUB00093122]]. JAM2 was initially identified as an endothelial adhesion molecule that plays a role in the architecture of interendothelial junctions and control leukocyte migration to inflammatory sites [[cite:PUB00093120]].
