{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>E4 is an ubiquitin chain-elongation enzyme specifically involved in polyubiquitin chain assembly. It is involved in N-terminal ubiquitin fusion degradation proteolytic pathway (UFD pathway). E4 binds to the ubiquitin moieties of preformed conjugates and catalyses ubiquitin chain assembly in conjunction with E1, E2, and E3. E4 appears to influence the formation and topology of the multi-Ub chain as it enhances ubiquitination at 'Lys-48' but not at 'Lys-29' of the N-terminal Ub moiety [[cite:PUB00098106]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5o75", "name" "Ube4B U-box domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13931" "UBIQUITINATION FACTOR E4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin conjugation factor E4", "short" "UBE4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2683, "taxa" 9172, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7795, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7795, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4304}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
