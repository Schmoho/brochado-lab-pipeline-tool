{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian specific BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa protein-interacting protein 3 or BNIP3 sequences. BNIP3 belongs to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only family, a Bcl-2-related family possessing an atypical Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain, which regulates PCD from mitochondrial sites by selective Bcl-2/Bcl-XL interactions. BNIP3 family members contain a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is required for their mitochondrial localisation, homodimerisation, as well as regulation of their pro-apoptotic activities. BNIP3-mediated apoptosis has been reported to be independent of caspase activation and cytochrome c release and is characterised by early plasma membrane and mitochondrial damage, prior to the appearance of chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation [[cite:PUB00012651]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15186" "RE48077P"}, "pfam" {"PF06553" "BNIP3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BNIP3", "short" "BNIP3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 31, "proteomes" 929, "taxa" 3750, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3495, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3463, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2361}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010548", :literature {"PUB00012651" {"URL" nil, "issue" "26", "authors" ["Lamy L" "Ticchioni M" "Rouquette-Jazdanian AK" "Samson M" "Deckert M" "Greenberg AH" "Bernard A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
