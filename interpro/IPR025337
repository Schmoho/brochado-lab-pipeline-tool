{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of oxidoreductases involved in the synthesis of different polyketides and derivatives. Questin oxidase GedK from Aspergillus terreus catalyses the ring cleavage of the anthraquinone questin to form benzophenone desmethylsulochrin [[cite:PUB00086982]]. It is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of geodin, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of other natural products [[cite:PUB00081405]]. MdpL from Emericella nidulans is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of monodictyphenone [[cite:PUB00086983]]. TpcI from Neosartorya fumigata is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of trypacidin, a mycotoxin with antiprotozoal activity and that plays a role in the infection process [[cite:PUB00093718], [cite:PUB00093719]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes ptaJ from Pestalotiopsis fici, AflY from Aspergillus parasiticus, CPUR_05427 from the phytopathogenic Claviceps purpurea, AgnL3 from Paecilomyces divaricatus and NotM from Aspergillus sp.. PtaJ is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of pestheic acid, a diphenyl ether which is a biosynthetic precursor of the unique chloropupukeananes [[cite:PUB00088179]]. AflY is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of aflatoxins, the most toxic and carcinogenic compounds among the known mycotoxins [[cite:PUB00088181], [cite:PUB00083132]]. CPUR_05427 is part of the ergochrome gene cluster that is responsible for the typical purple-black color of the sclerotia containing the toxic ergot alkaloids [[cite:PUB00088717]]. AgnL3 is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of agnestins, dihydroxy-xanthone metabolites [[cite:PUB00093720]]. NotM is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of notoamide that is a fungal indole alkaloid [[cite:PUB00093703]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8z4q", "name" "The crystal structure of a Hydroquinone Dioxygenase PaD"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35870" "PROTEIN, PUTATIVE (AFU_ORTHOLOGUE AFUA_5G03330)-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF14027" "Questin oxidase-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Questin oxidase-like", "short" "Questin_oxidase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 82, "proteomes" 1448, "taxa" 4505, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5794, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5624, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3530}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
