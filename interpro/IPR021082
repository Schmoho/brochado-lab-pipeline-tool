{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein GAPT (also known as Growth-factor Receptor-Bound protein 2 (GRB2)-binding adaptor protein, transmembrane) belongs to a class of transmembrane (TM) adaptor proteins that couple antigen receptor engagement to downstream signalling cascades in lymphocytes [[cite:PUB00053335]]. Expressed in B cells and myeloid cells, GAPT negatively regulates B-cell proliferation following stimulation through the B-cell receptor; it may also play an important role in the proper maintenance of marginal zone B-cells [[cite:PUB00053335]].</p>\n\n<p>GAPT has an extracellular domain, a TM domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with multiple GRB2-binding motifs; it constitutively associates with GRB2 SH3 domains via a proline-rich region [[cite:PUB00053335]]. Its cytosolic domain contains 7 tyrosine residues (4 of them within GRB2-binding motifs), and 2 cysteines in the juxta-membrane region, which may be palmitoylated [[cite:PUB00053335]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02077" "Protein GAPT"}, "panther" {"PTHR37350" "PROTEIN GAPT"}, "pfam" {"PF11770" "GRB2-binding adapter (GAPT)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein GAPT", "short" "Protein_GAPT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 133, "taxa" 699, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 209, "sets" 0, "proteins" 209, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 132}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021082", :literature {"PUB00053335" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Liu Y" "Zhang W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
