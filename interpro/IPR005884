{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In bacteria two distinct, membrane-bound, enzyme complexes are responsible for the interconversion of fumarate and succinate ([ec:1.3.99.1]): fumaratereductase (Frd) is used in anaerobic growth, and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh) is used in aerobic growth. Both complexes consist of two main components: a membrane-extrinsic component composed of a FAD-binding flavoprotein and an iron-sulphur protein; and an hydrophobic component composed of a membrane anchor protein and/or a cytochrome B.</p>\n\n<p>In eukaryotes mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) ([ec:1.3.5.1]) is an enzyme composed of two subunits: a FAD flavoprotein and and iron-sulphur protein.</p>\n\n<p>The flavoprotein subunit is a protein of about 60 to 70 Kd to which FAD is covalently bound to a histidine residue which is located in the N-terminal section of the protein [[cite:PUB00002503]]. The sequence around that histidine is well conserved in Frd and Sdh from various bacterial and eukaryotic species [[cite:PUB00002711]].</p>\n\n<p>The terms succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase may be used interchangeably in certain systems. However, a number of species have distinct complexes, with the fumarate reductase active under anaerobic conditions. This model represents the fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit from several such species in which a distinct succinate dehydrogenase is also found.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01176" "fumarate reductase (quinol) flavoprotein subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fumarate reductase, flavoprotein subunit", "short" "Fum_red_fp"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 371, "taxa" 2543, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2330, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2330, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1798}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1391", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1391"} {"accession" "GenProp1267", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1267"} {"accession" "GenProp0756", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0756"} {"accession" "GenProp1672", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1672"} {"accession" "GenProp1537", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1537"} {"accession" "GenProp1143", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1143"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
