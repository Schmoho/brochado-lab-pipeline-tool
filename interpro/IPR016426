{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Methanosarcina acetivorans, MA1821 is a L-aspartate semialdehyde sulfurtransferase required for O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase (OAHS)-independent homocysteine (Hcy) biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00078766], [cite:PUB00093781]]. It contains two C-terminal cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains. The CBS domains bind S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) and 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which induce a conformational change consistent with regulatory function. Another protein in the same pathway, MA1822, is involved in the reduction of the disulfide formed in MA1821 during the conversion of Asa (aspartate semialdehyde) to Hcy [[cite:PUB00078766], [cite:PUB00093781]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004698" "Uncharacterised protein with CBS domain pair, MJ0100 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-aspartate semialdehyde sulfurtransferase MA1821-like", "short" "MA1821-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 497, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 511, "sets" 0, "proteins" 511, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 436}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
