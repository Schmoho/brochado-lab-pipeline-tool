{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents nickel-dependent superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) ([ec:1.15.1.1]), a SOD enzyme that uses nickel, rather than iron, manganese, copper, or zinc. All SOD enzymes catalyse the dismutation of toxic superoxide radical anions to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in order to protect cells from oxidative damage. The catalytic cycle of NiSOD consists of two half-reactions, each initiated by the successive approach of substrate to the metal centre. The first (reductive) phase involves Ni(III) reduction to Ni(II), and the second (oxidative) phase involves the metal reoxidation back to its resting state [[cite:PUB00035719]]. NiSOD has a novel SOD fold and assembly, consisting of a hexameric assembly of 4-helix bundles of up-and-down topology, which contains a 9-residue nickel-hook structural motif that is critical for metal binding and catalysis [[cite:PUB00031358]]. A gene for a required protease (NiSOD maturation protease; [interpro:IPR014124]) is adjacent to the NiSOD gene.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1t6u", "name" "Nickel Superoxide Dismutase (NiSOD) Native 1.30 A Structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036502", "name" "Nickel-containing superoxide dismutase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09055" "Nickel-containing superoxide dismutase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02753" "superoxide dismutase, Ni"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Superoxide dismutase, Nickel-type", "short" "Superoxide_dismutase_Ni-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 21, "proteomes" 1154, "taxa" 4644, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4930, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4927, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3717}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0213", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0213"} {"accession" "GenProp0488", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0488"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
