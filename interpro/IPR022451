{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family occur in various species of the genus Bacillus, always next to the gene (kamA or ablA) for lysine 2,3-aminomutase. Members have a pair of CXXC motifs, and share homology to the amino-terminal region of a family of putative transcription factors for which the C-terminal is modeled by [pfam:PF01381], a helix-turn-helix domain model. This family, however, is shorter and lacks the helix-turn-helix region. The function of this protein family is unknown, but a regulatory role in compatible solute biosynthesis is suggested by local genome context.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03829" "YokU family protein"}, "pfam" {"PF14122" "YokU-like protein, putative antitoxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03829, YokU", "short" "CHP03829_YokU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 144, "taxa" 675, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 629, "sets" 0, "proteins" 629, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 439}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022451", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022451", "name" "Conserved hypothetical protein CHP03829, YokU", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 160}}}
