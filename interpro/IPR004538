{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood cell membranes and cause cell rupture. The mechanism of action is not well defined. Hemolysin A is induced by sodium ribonucleate, and is produced by pathogenic bacterial strains. Haemolysin A from Treponema hyodysenteriae causes swine dysentery [[cite:PUB00043014]]. The homologous protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is known as 16S/23S rRNA (cytidine-2'-O)-methyltransferase TlyA and exhibits haemolytic activity in vitro. It catalyses the 2'-O-methylation at nucleotides C1409 in 16S rRNA and C1920 in 23S rRNA [[cite:PUB00043015], [cite:PUB00059301], [cite:PUB00059302]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5kyg", "name" "RAWV_CTD (Loop Structure) of 16S/23S 2'-O-methyltransferase TlyA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005578" "Bifunctional hemolysin/ribosomal RNA methyl transferase TlyA"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00478" "TlyA family rRNA (cytidine-2'-O)-methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hemolysin A /rRNA methyltransferase TlyA", "short" "Hemolysin_A/TlyA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5905, "taxa" 21713, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23146, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23113, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17505}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
