UlaD catalyzes a Î²-keto acid decarboxylation reaction to produce L-xylulose-5-phosphate, which undergoes successive epimerization reactions with UlaE (L-xylulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase) and UlaF (L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase), yielding D-xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036237", "name" "Xylose isomerase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01951" "L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase UlaE [ulaE]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase, Enterobacteriaceae", "short" "L-Ru-5P_3-Epase_Enterobacteria"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 390, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 547, "sets" 0, "proteins" 547, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 461}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
