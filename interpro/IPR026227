{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Hydrolethalus syndrome (HLS) is an autosomal recessive lethal malformation syndrome, leading to still-birth, or death shortly after birth. The syndrome is characterised by hydrocephaly, with absent upper midline structures of the brain, micrognathia and polydactyly. A variety of other features (including cleft lip or palate, club feet, anomalies of the ears, eyes and nose, a keyhole-shaped defect in the occipital bone, abnormal genitalia, and congenital heart and respiratory organ defects) have also been observed in affected individuals [[cite:PUB00060247]]. Characterisation of the underlying molecular defect is important, as it could both expose new molecular pathway(s) essential for normal human development and provide new insights into foetal malformation syndromes.</p>\n\n<p>The critical HLS region has been defined to a 476 kb interval using cases from 30 Finnish HLS families [[cite:PUB00060247]]. Within this region, sequence analysis has revealed a point mutation in a novel gene (termed HYLS1) that results in substitution of a well-conserved Asp by Gly in the Centriolar and ciliogenesis-associated protein HYLS1, which is essential for early development of the human foetus [[cite:PUB00060247]].</p>\n\n<p>HYLS1 is dispensable for centriole assembly and centrosome function in cell division. Instead, HYLS1 plays an essential role in cilia formation that is conserved between C. elegans and vertebrates [[cite:PUB00101113]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02098" "Hydrolethalus syndrome protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Centriolar and ciliogenesis-associated protein HYLS1", "short" "HYLS1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 257, "taxa" 1116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1949, "sets" 0, "proteins" 361, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 227}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026227", :literature {"PUB00060247" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Mee L" "Honkala H" "Kopra O" "Vesa J" "Finnila S" "Visapaa I" "Sang TK" "Jackson GR" "Salonen R" "Kestila M" "Peltonen L."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
