{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial periplasmic or secreted ([ec:3.1.21.1]) Escherichia coli endonuclease I (EndoI) is a sequence independent endonuclease located in the periplasm. It is inhibited by different RNA species. It is thought to normally generate double strand breaks in DNA, except in the presence of high salt concentrations and RNA, when it generates single strand breaks in DNA. Its biological role is unknown [[cite:PUB00009914]]. Other family members are known to be extracellular [[cite:PUB00009915]]. This family also includes a non-specific, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-activated ribonuclease precursor ([swissprot:Q03091]) [[cite:PUB00009916]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2g7e", "name" "The 1.6 A crystal structure of Vibrio cholerae extracellular endonuclease I"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044925", "name" "His-Me finger superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33607" "ENDONUCLEASE-1"}, "pfam" {"PF04231" "Endonuclease I"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endonuclease I", "short" "Endonuclease-I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 363, "proteomes" 1996, "taxa" 9872, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13248, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13067, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9549}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
