{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta) are cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and hematopoiesis [[cite:PUB00007346]]. Two types of IL-1 receptor, each with three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, limited sequence similarity (28%) and different pharmacological characteristics have been cloned from mouse and human cell lines: these have been termed type I and type II receptors [[cite:PUB00007347]]. The receptors both exist in transmembrane (TM) and soluble forms: the soluble IL-1 receptor is thought to be post-translationally derived from cleavage of the extracellular portion of the membrane receptors.</p>\n\n<p>Both IL-1 receptors appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location [[cite:PUB00007348]]. The receptors can both bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1RA).</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structures of IL1A and IL1B [[cite:PUB00004697]] have been solved, showing them to share the same 12-stranded β-sheet structure as both the heparin binding growth factors and the Kunitz-type soybean trypsin inhibitors [[cite:PUB00003281]]. The β-sheets are arranged in 3 similar lobes around a central axis, 6 strands forming an anti-parallel β-barrel. Several regions, especially the loop between strands 4 and 5, have been implicated in receptor binding.</p>\n\n<p>The Vaccinia virus genes B15R and B18R each encode proteins with N-terminal hydrophobic sequences, possible sites for attachment of N-linked carbohydrate and a short C-terminal hydrophobic domain [[cite:PUB00007349]]. These properties are consistent with the mature proteins being either virion, cell surface or secretory glycoproteins. Protein sequence comparisons reveal that the gene products are related to each other (20% identity) and to the Ig superfamily. The highest degree of similarity is to the human and murine interleukin-1 receptors, although both proteins are related to a wide range of Ig superfamily members, including the interleukin-6 receptor. A novel method for virus immune evasion has been proposed in which the product of one or both of these proteins may bind interleukin-1 and/or interleukin-6, preventing these cytokines reaching their natural receptors [[cite:PUB00007349]]. A similar gene product from Cowpox virus (CPV) has also been shown to specifically bind murine IL-1 beta [[cite:PUB00007350]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the IL-1 family alpha (IL1A).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008996", "name" "Cytokine IL1/FGF", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01358" "INTRLEUKIN1A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-1 alpha", "short" "IL-1_alpha"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 131, "taxa" 485, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2213, "sets" 0, "proteins" 252, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 178}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003295", :literature {"PUB00004697" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Priestle JP" "Schar HP" "Grutter MG."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
