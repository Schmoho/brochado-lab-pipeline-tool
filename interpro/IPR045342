{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the Septation protein Etd1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which activates the  GTPase Spg1 to trigger signaling through the septum initiation network (SIN) pathway and onset of cytokinesis. The proper regulation of Etd1 is crucial for both activation of Spg1 in anaphase and inactivation of Spg1 when cytokinesis is complete [[cite:PUB00098635]]. It was suggested that Etd1 is the functional homologue of budding yeast Lte1 as they have the same function but a very low sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00098635]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20162" "Septation protein etd1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Septation protein Etd1", "short" "Etd1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 670, "taxa" 1666, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 990, "sets" 0, "proteins" 989, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 588}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045342", :literature {"PUB00098635" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Garcia-Cortes JC" "McCollum D."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Biol", "title" "Proper timing of cytokinesis is regulated by Schizosaccharomyces pombe Etd1.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "739-53", "volume" "186", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19736319}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005096", "name" "GTPase activator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:1902412", "name" "regulation of mitotic cytokinesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045342", "name" "Septation protein Etd1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 491}}}
