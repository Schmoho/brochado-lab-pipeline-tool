{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mammalian specific proacrosin binding protein sp32 sequences. sp32 is a sperm specific protein, which is known to bind with 55- and 53kDa proacrosins and the 49kDa acrosin intermediate. The exact function of sp32 is unclear, it is thought however that the binding of sp32 to proacrosin may be involved in packaging the acrosin zymogene into the acrosomal matrix [[cite:PUB00013050]]. During the activation of the boar proacrosin/acrosin system, the expression of sp32 is upregulated and its tyrosine phosphorylation levels is increased [[cite:PUB00077124]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07222" "Proacrosin binding protein sp32"}, "panther" {"PTHR21362" "ACROSIN-BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proacrosin binding sp32", "short" "Proacrosin-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 505, "taxa" 1661, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 713}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009865", :literature {"PUB00077124" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Dong HT" "Shi WS" "Tian Y" "Cao LP" "Jin Y."], "ISO_journal" "Genet.
