{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme, characterised in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and found in several other methanogens, modifies coenzyme F420 by ligation of AMP (or GMP) from ATP (or GTP). On F420, it activates an aromatic hydroxyl group, which is unusual chemistry for an adenylyltransferase. This enzyme name has also been attached to numbers of uncharacterised genes which are instead likely to act as phenylacetate CoA ligase, based on their proximity to predicted indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase ([ec:1.2.7.8]) genes. The enzyme itself acts during transient exposure of the organism to oxygen [[cite:PUB00093687]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03335" "coenzyme F390 synthetase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coenzyme F390 synthetase", "short" "Coenzyme_F390_Synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 30, "taxa" 274, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 211, "sets" 0, "proteins" 211, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 184}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017720", :literature {"PUB00093687" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Vermeij P" "Vinke E" "Keltjens JT" "Van der Drift C."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
