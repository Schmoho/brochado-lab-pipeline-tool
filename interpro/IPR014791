{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The bacteriophage baseplate controls host cell recognition, attachment, tail sheath contraction and viral DNA ejection. The baseplate is a multi-subunit assembly at the distal end of the tail, which is composed of long and short tail fibres [[cite:PUB00029807]]. The tail region is responsible for attachment to the host bacteria during infection: long tail fibres enable host receptor recognition, while irreversible attachment is via short tail fibres. Recognition and attachment induce a conformational transition of the baseplate from a hexagonal to a star-shaped structure. In viruses such as Bacteriophage T4, Gp11 acts as a structural protein to connect the short tail fibres to the baseplate, while Gp9 connects the baseplate with the long tail fibres. Both Gp9 and Gp11 are trimers.  Each Gp11 monomer consists of three domains, which are entwined together in the trimer: the N-terminal domains of the three monomers form a central, trimeric, parallel coiled coil surrounded by the entwined middle finger domains; the C-terminal domains appear to be responsible for trimerisation [[cite:PUB00036076]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1el6", "name" "STRUCTURE OF BACTERIOPHAGE T4 GENE PRODUCT 11, THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE BASEPLATE AND SHORT TAIL FIBERS"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015976", "name" "Bacteriophage T4, Gp11, C-terminal finger domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR015982", "name" "Baseplate structural protein Gp11, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036214", "name" "Baseplate structural protein Gp11 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043180", "name" "Baseplate structural protein Gp11, C-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08677" "GP11 baseplate wedge protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baseplate structural protein Gp11", "short" "Baseplate_struct_Gp11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 63, "taxa" 976, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 680, "sets" 0, "proteins" 680, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014791", :literature {"PUB00036076" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Leiman PG" "Kostyuchenko VA" "Shneider MM" "Kurochkina LP" "Mesyanzhinov VV" "Rossmann MG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
