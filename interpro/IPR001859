{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins P1/P2.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic ribosomal P proteins have been classified according to their similarity to the mammalian P0, P1 and P2 proteins [[cite:PUB00004501]], all of which share a similar primary structure: an apparently globular N-terminal domain (which includes the protein core); an Ala-rich hinge region; and a highly-acidic Glu/Asp-rich C-terminal domain - this contains the ribosomal P consensus sequence EESDDDMGFGLFD, which protrudes from the ribosomal stalk.</p>\n\n<p>The C-terminal regions of Trypanosoma cruzi P proteins are strongly immunogenic in Chagas disease. All 3 forms of the protein show the ability to generate autoimmune responses, but their antigenic properties differ as a result of discrepancies in their C-terminal sequences [[cite:PUB00004501]]. The main linear epitope of the T. cruzi P1 and P2 proteins has been mapped to the 13-residue C-terminal sequence (R-13) EEEDDDMGFGLFD. This is identical to the eukaryotic P consensus, but has Ser substituted by Glu, yielding a more hydrophilic sequence, which is critical in determining the immunological reactivity of the T. cruzi R-13 epitope in Chagas disease.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00456" "RIBOSOMALP2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein P1/P2, eukaryotes", "short" "Ribosomal_P1/P2_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 991, "taxa" 4578, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7687, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2509, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1713}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001859", :literature {"PUB00004501" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Levin MJ" "Vazquez M" "Kaplan D" "Schijman AG."], "ISO_journal" "Parasitol.
