{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The CPA2 family is a moderately large family (over 100 sequenced members) from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Among the functionally well-characterised members of the family are (1) the KefB/KefC K+ efflux proteins of Escherichia coli which may be capable of catalysing both K+/H+ antiport and K+ uniport, depending on conditions [[cite:PUB00053152], [cite:PUB00003817]], (2) the Na+/H+ antiporter of Enterococcus hirae [[cite:PUB00053153]] and (3) the K+/H+ antiporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been proposed that under normal physiological conditions, these proteins may function by essentially the same mechanism [[cite:PUB00053154]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KefC and KefB of E. coli are responsible for glutathione-gated K+ efflux [[cite:PUB00053155], [cite:PUB00053156]]. Each of these proteins consists of a transmembrane hydrophobic N-terminal domain, and a less well-conserved C-terminal hydrophilic domain. Each protein interacts with a second protein encoded by genes that overlap the gene encoding the primary transporter. The KefB ancillary protein is YheR. The ancillary proteins stimulate transport activity about 10-fold [[cite:PUB00053157]]. They are important for cell survival during exposure to toxic metabolites, possibly because they can release K+, allowing H+ uptake. Activation of the KefB or KefC K+ efflux system only occurs in the presence of glutathione and a reactive electrophile such as methylglyoxal or N-ethylmaleimide. Formation of the methylglyoxal-glutathione conjugate, S-lactoylglutathione, is catalysed by glyoxalase I, and S-lactoylglutathione activates KefB and KefC [[cite:PUB00053158]]. H+ uptake (acidification of the cytoplasm) accompanying or following K+ efflux may serve as a further protective mechanism against electrophile toxicity [[cite:PUB00053155], [cite:PUB00053156]]. Inhibition of transport by glutathione is enhanced by NADH [[cite:PUB00044836]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038770", "name" "Sodium/solute symporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01412" "Glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system protein KefB [kefB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system protein KefB", "short" "K_H_efflux_KefB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 168, "taxa" 1423, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1706, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1706, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1317}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1131", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1131"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020884", :literature {"PUB00053158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["MacLean MJ" "Ness LS" "Ferguson GP" "Booth IR."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
