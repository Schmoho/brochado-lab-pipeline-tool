{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Found in the main part of the sperm flagellum, the fibrous sheath is a cytoskeletal structure comprising two longitudinal columns connected by closely spaced circumferential ribs [[cite:PUB00060267]]. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) secure cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases within specific cytoplasmic domains; most abundant in the fibrous sheath is AKAP4 [[cite:PUB00060267]]. AKAP4 has been shown to bind AKAP3 and two spermatogenic cell-specific proteins, Fibrous Sheath Interacting Proteins 1 and 2 (FSIP1, FSIP2) [[cite:PUB00060267]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How the fibrous sheath assembles is not yet fully understood. AKAP4 is synthesised and incorporated into the nascent fibrous sheath late in spermatid development; its precursor is processed in the flagellum, and only the mature form of AKAP4 appears to bind AKAP3 [[cite:PUB00060267]]. It is likely, therefore, that AKAP3 is involved in organising the basic structure of the fibrous sheath, while AKAP4 helps to complete fibrous sheath assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FSIP1 protein is 435 amino acids in length, and is rich in glutamine and asparagine [[cite:PUB00060267]]. Minimum domains for its binding to AKAP4 have been localised to amino acids 351-359 and 692-721 of AKAP4 constructs [[cite:PUB00060267]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02075" "Fibrous sheath-interacting protein 1"}, "pfam" {"PF15554" "FSIP1 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR22012" "FIBROUS SHEATH INTERACTING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fibrous sheath-interacting protein 1", "short" "Fsip1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 590, "taxa" 2280, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1239, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1080, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 711}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026246", :literature {"PUB00060267" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Brown PR" "Miki K" "Harper DB" "Eddy EM."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
