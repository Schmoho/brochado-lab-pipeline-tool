{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ca2+ ions are unique in that they not only carry charge but they are also the most widely used of diffusible second messengers. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) are a family of molecules that allow cells to couple electrical activity to intracellular Ca2+ signalling. The opening and closing of these channels by depolarizing stimuli, such as action potentials, allows Ca2+ ions to enter neurons down a steep electrochemical gradient, producing transient intracellular Ca2+ signals. Many of the processes that occur in neurons, including transmitter release, gene transcription and metabolism are controlled by Ca2+ influx occurring simultaneously at different cellular locales. The pore is formed by the alpha-1 subunit which incorporates the conduction pore, the voltage sensor and gating apparatus, and the known sites of channel regulation by second messengers, drugs, and toxins [[cite:PUB00036034]]. The activity of this pore is modulated by four tightly-coupled subunits: an intracellular beta subunit; a transmembrane gamma subunit; and a disulphide-linked complex of alpha-2 and delta subunits, which are proteolytically cleaved from the same gene product. Properties of the protein including gating voltage-dependence, G protein modulation and kinase susceptibility can be influenced by these subunits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voltage-gated calcium channels are classified as T, L, N, P, Q and R, and are distinguished by their sensitivity to pharmacological blocks, single-channel conductance kinetics, and voltage-dependence. On the basis of their voltage activation properties, the voltage-gated calcium classes can be further divided into two broad groups: the low (T-type) and high (L, N, P, Q and R-type)                threshold-activated channels.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma (VDCCG) subunit family consists of at least 8 members, which share a number of common structural features [[cite:PUB00007806]].

The first extracellular loop contains a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and a pair of conserved cysteine residues. The C-terminal 7 residues of VDCCG-2, -3, -4 and -8 are also conserved and contain a consensus site for phosphorylation by cAMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, and a target site for binding by PDZ domain proteins [[cite:PUB00007806]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01792" "VDCCGAMMA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Voltage-dependent calcium channel, gamma subunit", "short" "VDCC_gsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 99, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 694, "taxa" 2447, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16547, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6052, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4050}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008368", :literature {"PUB00007806" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Burgess DL" "Gefrides LA" "Foreman PJ" "Noebels JL."], "ISO_journal" "Genomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/geno.2000.6440", "medline_journal" "Genomics", "title" "A cluster of three novel Ca2+ channel gamma subunit genes on chromosome 19q13.4: evolution and expression profile of the gamma subunit gene family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "339-50", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11170751}, "PUB00036034" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Catterall WA" "Striessnig J" "Snutch TP" "Perez-Reyes E; International Union of Pharmacology."], "ISO_journal" "Pharmacol.
