{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sucrose occupies a central position in the metabolic pathways of all plants and plays a variety of roles including transport sugar, storage reserve, compatible solute, and signal compound [[cite:PUB00017810]]. This compound is produced by the combined action of two enzymes, sucrose-phosphate synthase ([ec:2.4.1.14]) and sucrose-phosphate phosphatase ([ec:3.1.3.24]), via the intermediate sucrose 6-phosphate. Several studies have shown a positive correlation between sucrose-phosphate synthase activity and plant growth rate and yield in agronomically important plants, though direct proof of a causal link is lacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents sucrose-phosphate synthase from plants, which is known to exist in multigene families in several species of both monocots and dicots. The enzyme contains an N-terminal domain glucosyltransferase domain, a variable linker region, and a C-terminal domain similar to that of sucrose-phosphate phosphatase, the next and final enzyme of sucrose biosynthesis. The C-terminal domain is likely to serve a binding - not a catalytic - function, as sucrose-phosphate phosphatase is always encoded by a distinct protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02468" "sucrose-phosphate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sucrose-phosphate synthase, plant", "short" "SPS_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 244, "taxa" 992, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1924, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1922, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1084}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
