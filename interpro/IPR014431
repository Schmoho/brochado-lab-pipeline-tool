{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tellurite resistance protein TehB is encoded by tellurite-reducing operon<i>tehAB</i> [[cite:PUB00027707]]. Members of this entry are two-domain proteins with a C-terminal S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase domain and an N-terminal domain of unknown function. In Escherichia coli, Salmonella and some other organisms, the two domains exist in stand-alone form: YeaR protein ([interpro:IPR014510]) and single-domain TehB methyltransferase ([interpro:IPR004537]).</p>\r\n<p>When upregulated or present in high copy number, TehB is responsible for potassium tellurite resistance, which is probably caused by increasing the reduction rate of tellurite to metallic tellurium within the bacterium. TehB is a cytoplasmic protein that possesses three conserved motifs (I, II, and III) found in SAM-dependent non-nucleic acid methyltransferases [[cite:PUB00014885]]. Conformational changes in TehB are observed upon binding of both tellurite and SAM, suggesting that TehB utilises a methyltransferase activity in the detoxification of tellurite [[cite:PUB00027741]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3m70", "name" "Crystal Structure of TehB from Haemophilus influenzae"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005215" "Tellurite resistance methyltransferase, TehB type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tellurite resistance methyltransferase, TehB type-2", "short" "Tellurite-R_TehB-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 1019, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1176, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1176, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 892}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
