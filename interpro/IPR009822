{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several hypothetical bacterial proteins of around 180 residues in length, which are often known as YaeQ. YaeQ is homologous to RfaH, a specialised transcription elongation protein and YaeQ is known to compensate for loss of RfaH function [[cite:PUB00013018]]. However, YaeQ does not appear to affect transcription directly and this suppression is most likely due to an indirect effect, so the function of this protein remains unknown [[cite:PUB00056830]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Structural studies indicate that YaeQ contains a variation of the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease motif found in various endonucleases and enzymes involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination [[cite:PUB00047490]]. This structure, and the high degree of sequence conservation amongst YaeQ and its homologues, suggest that it may be involved in the remodeling or modification of nucleic acid DNA or RNA structures.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2g3w", "name" "The Crystal Structure of YaeQ Protein from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011335", "name" "Restriction endonuclease type II-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038590", "name" "YaeQ superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01322" "YaeQ"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF011484" "Predicted nuclease, YaeQ type"}, "pfam" {"PF07152" "YaeQ protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YaeQ", "short" "YaeQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 1608, "taxa" 7520, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7922, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7922, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6143}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009822", :literature {"PUB00013018" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wong KR" "Hughes C" "Koronakis V."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
