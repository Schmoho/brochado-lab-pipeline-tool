{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1) proteins (also known as negative elongation factor B). It is thought that COBRA1 along with BRCA1 is involved in chromatin unfolding. COBRA1 is recruited to the chromosome site by the first BRCT repeat of BRCA1, and is itself sufficient to induce chromatin unfolding. BRCA1 mutations that enhance chromatin unfolding also increase its affinity for, and recruitment of, COBRA1. It is thought that that reorganisation of higher levels of chromatin structure is an important regulated step in BRCA1-mediated nuclear functions [[cite:PUB00012287]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06209" "Cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1)"}, "panther" {"PTHR13503" "NEGATIVE ELONGATION FACTOR COMPLEX MEMBER B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cofactor of BRCA1", "short" "COBRA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 39, "proteomes" 1152, "taxa" 4485, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2196, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2055, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1310}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010405", :literature {"PUB00012287" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Ye Q" "Hu YF" "Zhong H" "Nye AC" "Belmont AS" "Li R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
