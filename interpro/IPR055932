{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of uncharacterised archaeal proteins. They are predicted to have a structure composed of seven nearly orthogonally packed strands, four of which are located at the N-terminal and three at the C-terminal. The N- and C-terminal strands clamp to form a Î²-sandwich. They are separated by a ~50 aa long disordered region which contains a repetitive SPY sequence motif.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24350" "Family of unknown function (DUF7510)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7510", "short" "DUF7510"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 41, "taxa" 286, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 220, "sets" 0, "proteins" 218, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055932", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055932", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7510", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 46}}}
