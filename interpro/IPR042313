The messenger RNA of RELT  is especially abundant in hematologic tissues such as spleen, lymph node, and peripheral blood leukocytes as well as in leukemias and lymphomas. RELT is able to activate the NF-kappaB pathway and selectively binds tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 [[cite:PUB00053631]]. RELT like proteins 1 and 2 (RELL1 and RELL2) are two RELT homologues that bind to RELT.
