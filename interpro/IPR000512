{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diphtheria toxin ([ec:2.4.2.36]) is a 58kDa protein secreted by lysogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The toxin causes the disease diphtheria in humans by gaining entry into the cell cytoplasm and inhibiting protein synthesis [[cite:PUB00000429]]. The mechanism of inhibition involves transfer of the ADP-ribose group of NAD to elongation factor-2 (EF-2), rendering EF-2 inactive. The catalysed reaction is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>\n<reaction>\nNAD<sup>+</sup> + peptide diphthamide = nicotinamide + peptide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)diphthamide\n</reaction>\n</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of the diphtheria toxin homodimer has been determined to 2.5A resolution [[cite:PUB00004122]]. The structure reveals a Y-shaped molecule of 3 domains, a catalytic domain (fragment A), whose fold is of the α+β type; a transmembrane (TM) domain, which consists of 9 α-helices, 2 pairs of which may participate in pH-triggered membrane insertion and translocation; and a receptor-binding domain, which forms a flattened β-barrel with a jelly-roll-like topology [[cite:PUB00004122]]. The TM- and receptor binding-domains together constitute fragment B.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1f0l", "name" "1.55 ANGSTROM CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF WILD TYPE DIPHTHERIA TOXIN"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000490" "Diphtheria toxin"}, "prints" {"PR00769" "DPTHRIATOXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diphtheria toxin (NAD+-dipthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase)", "short" "Diphtheria_toxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 64, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 185, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
