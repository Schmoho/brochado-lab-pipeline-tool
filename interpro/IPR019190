{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), Exo5 is a single strand DNA specific 5'-exonuclease, which is involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and recombination. It has the capacity to slide across 5' double-stranded DNA or 5'RNA sequences and resumes cutting two nucleotides downstream of the double-stranded-to-single-stranded junction or RNA-to-DNA junction, respectively [[cite:PUB00062398]]. It degrades single-stranded, but not double-stranded, DNA from the 5'-end, and the products are dinucleotides, except the 3'-terminal tri- and tetranucleotides, which are not degraded. The initial hydrolytic cut of exonuclease V on the dephosphorylated substrate produces a mixture of dinucleoside monophosphates and trinucleoside diphosphates [[cite:PUB00066720]]. Exo5 is specific for single-stranded DNA and does not hydrolyze RNA [[cite:PUB00062398]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14464" "EXONUCLEASE V"}, "pfam" {"PF09810" "Exonuclease V - a 5' deoxyribonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Exonuclease V", "short" "EXOV"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 75, "proteomes" 1579, "taxa" 5139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3069, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2891, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1785}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019190", :literature {"PUB00062398" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Burgers PM" "Stith CM" "Yoder BL" "Sparks JL."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
