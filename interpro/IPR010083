{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme, FabA, shows overlapping substrate specificity with FabZ with regard to chain length in fatty acid biosynthesis. It is commonly designated 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase as if it were specific for that chain length, but its specificity is broader; it is active even in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. This enzyme can also isomerise trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP to bypass reduction by FabI and instead allow biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. FabA cannot elongate unsaturated fatty acids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FabA structure is a homodimer with two independent active sites located at the dimer interface. Each active site is tunnel-shaped and completely inaccessible to solvent. No metal ions or cofactors are required for ligand binding or catalysis [[cite:PUB00005275]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8b72", "name" "Crystal structure of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with Z30857828"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029069", "name" "HotDog domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01287" "FabA"}, "hamap" {"MF_00405" "3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase [fabA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01749" "3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase FabA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-hydroxyacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) dehydratase FabA", "short" "FabA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2182, "taxa" 9519, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9667, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7028}, "pathways" 68}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0681", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0681"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
