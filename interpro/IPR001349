{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochrome c oxidase ([ec:1.9.3.1]) is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which is a component of the respiratory chain complex and is involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen [[cite:PUB00000581]].  In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In eukaryotes, in addition to the three large subunits, I, II and III, that form the catalytic centre of the enzyme complex, there are a variable number of small polypeptidic subunits. One of these subunits is known as VIa in vertebrates and fungi. Mammals have two tissue-specific isoforms of VIa, a liver (VIa-L) and a heart and skeletal muscle isoform (VIa-H). Mammalian VIa-H induces a slip in CcO (decrease in proton/electron stoichiometry) at high intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios, while VIa-L induces a permanent slip in CcO, depending on the presence of cardiolipin and palmitate [[cite:PUB00079537]].  Only one form is found in fish [[cite:PUB00000674]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7w3e", "name" "Bovine cytochrome c oxidese in CN-bound fully reduced state at 50 K"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036418", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIa superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00925" "Cyt_c_Oxidase_VIa"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000277" "Cytochrome-c oxidase, subunit VIa"}, "panther" {"PTHR11504" "CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE POLYPEPTIDE VIA"}, "pfam" {"PF02046" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIa"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VIa", "short" "Cyt_c_oxidase_su6a"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 114, "domain_architectures" 37, "proteomes" 2344, "taxa" 8006, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4581, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4562, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2959}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC01032", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC01032"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1426", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1426"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001349", :literature {"PUB00000581" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Capaldi RA" "Malatesta F" "Darley-Usmar VM."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
