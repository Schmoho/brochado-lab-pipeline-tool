{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from plants and lower eukaryotes that are related to the archaeal DNA/RNA-binding protein Alba, also called histone-like protein ([interpro:IPR013795]), and its eukaryotic homologues RNase P/MRP subunits Pop7/Rpp20 ([interpro:IPR014612]) and Rpp25. Members of this family are the uncharacterised protein At2g34160 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which affects rRNA processing [[cite:PUB00153039]], and Endonuclease ALBA3 from Plasmodium falciparum, which can bind both DNA and RNA [[cite:PUB00153038], [cite:PUB00153040]].</p>\n\n<p>Structural comparisons have shown that Alba (Sso10b2 from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus) is topologically similar to several RNA-binding proteins (or A-DNA-binding) and includes IF3-C, YhhP, and DNase I. All of them have a similar IF3-C fold [[cite:PUB00022778], [cite:PUB00019120]] and it has been suggested that the ancestral function of the IF3-C fold is related to RNA interaction, and that the Alba superfamily proteins originated as RNA-binding proteins that formed various ribonucleoprotein complexes, probably including RNase P, and were then recruited as a chromosomal protein within the crenarchaeal lineage [[cite:PUB00019120]]. Based on this, it has been suggested that the archaeal Alba proteins ([pirsf:PIRSF028732]) are involved in RNA binding as well as DNA binding [[cite:PUB00022778], [cite:PUB00019120]], a prediction that has been confirmed experimentally [[cite:PUB00027864]].</p>\n\n<p>For more information about Alba, please see [pirsf:PIRSF028732].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q3v", "name" "Ensemble refinement of the protein crystal structure of gene product from Arabidopsis thaliana At2g34160"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036882", "name" "Alba-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31947" "DNA/RNA-BINDING PROTEIN ALBA 3"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF030333" "Predicted DNA/RNA-binding protein related to Alba"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP030333, DNA/RNA-binding Alba-related", "short" "UCP030333_Alba"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 332, "taxa" 1456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2257, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2224, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1389}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014560", :literature {"PUB00022778" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Chou CC" "Lin TW" "Chen CY" "Wang AH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
