{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family describes cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase CbiA protein of cobalamin biosynthesis. It is responsible for the amidation of cobyrinic acid to cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide via the intermediate formation of cobyrinic acid c-monoamide or hydrogenobrynic acid. NH(2) groups are provided by glutamine and one molecule of ATP hydrogenolyzed for each amidation [[cite:PUB00033892]]. This entry also includes the hydrogenobyrinate a,c-diamide synthase CobB that catalyzes the ATP-dependent amidation of the two carboxylate groups at positions a and c of hydrogenobyrinate, using either L-glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen source [[cite:PUB00015238], [cite:PUB00153010]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43873" "COBYRINATE A,C-DIAMIDE SYNTHASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00027" "Hydrogenobyrinate a,c-diamide synthase [cobB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00379" "cobyrinic/hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cobyrinate/Hydrogenobyrinate a,c-diamide synthase CbiA/CobB", "short" "CbiA/CobB_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4536, "taxa" 18234, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20508, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20503, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16148}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0275", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0275"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
