{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Some Gram-negative animal enteropathogens express a specialised secretion system to directly \"inject\" exotoxins into the cytoplasm of host cells. Dubbed the type III secretion system, it is of specific interest to researchers, as the components of such a system are only expressed in pathogenic strains [[cite:PUB00007817]]. The system is composed of structural proteins and exotoxin effectors; these are often encoded on large virulence plasmids or on the bacterial chromosome itself [[cite:PUB00007817]].</p>\n\n<p>The IpgD and SopB virulence factor proteins, represented by this entry, are two such type III secretion system exotoxin effectors.</p>\n\n<p>In Shigella flexneri, IpgD is translocated directly into eukaryotic cells and acts as a potent inositol 4-phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] into phosphatidylinositol 5-monophosphate [PtdIns(5)P], which then accumulates. Transformation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) into PtdIns(5)P by IpgD is responsible for dramatic morphological changes of the host cell, leading to a decrease in membrane tether force associated with membrane blebbing and actin filament remodelling [[cite:PUB00011913]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05925" "Enterobacterial virulence protein IpgD"}, "prints" {"PR01734" "TYPE3OMBPROT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphatase IpgD/SopB", "short" "IpgD/SopB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 51, "taxa" 558, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 910, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 823}, "pathways" 36}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
