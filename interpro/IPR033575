{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DDA1 is a core subunit of multiple Cul4-based E3 ligases (CRL4s), involved in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, which regulate key developmental and stress responses in eukaryotes [[cite:PUB00079134], [cite:PUB00079133]]. In mammals, DDA1 binds to DET1 and DDB1 to form DDD complexes, which recruit specific ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2E enzymes to form DDD-E2 complexes [[cite:PUB00044222]]. The DDD-E2 complex provides a platform for interaction with Cul4A and beta-transducing (also called WD40) repeat proteins. DDA1 is conserved in higher eukaryotes, including Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00079133]]. This entry also includes protein LOWER TEMPERATURE 1 (LOT1) from Arabidopsis which contains the conserved DDA1 domain. LOT1 supports abscisic acid (ABA) responses and drought tolerance by regulating the dynamic localization and stability (preventing degradation by the proteasome) of CAR proteins (C2-domain ABA-related, e.g. CAR9) [[cite:PUB00153154]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31879" "DET1- AND DDB1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DET1- and DDB1-associated protein 1-like", "short" "DDA1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 997, "taxa" 4205, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2457, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2457, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1591}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033575", :literature {"PUB00153154" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Qin T" "Tian Q" "Wang G" "Xiong L."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Plant", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.05.002", "medline_journal" "Mol Plant", "title" "LOWER TEMPERATURE 1 Enhances ABA Responses and Plant Drought Tolerance by Modulating the Stability and Localization of C2-Domain ABA-Related Proteins in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1243-1258", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31102784}, "PUB00079133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Irigoyen ML" "Iniesto E" "Rodriguez L" "Puga MI" "Yanagawa Y" "Pick E" "Strickland E" "Paz-Ares J" "Wei N" "De Jaeger G" "Rodriguez PL" "Deng XW" "Rubio V."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.113.122234", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Targeted degradation of abscisic acid receptors is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor DDA1 in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "712-28", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24563205}, "PUB00079134" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 7", "authors" ["Olma MH" "Roy M" "Le Bihan T" "Sumara I" "Maerki S" "Larsen B" "Quadroni M" "Peter M" "Tyers M" "Pintard L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
