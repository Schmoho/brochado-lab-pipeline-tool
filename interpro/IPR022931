{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the TusA family of sulfur carrier proteins. TusA (also known as SirA, UvrY and YhhP) belongs to a group of five proteins (TusA-E) which together are responsible for 2-thiouridylation of 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at tRNA wobble positions.
