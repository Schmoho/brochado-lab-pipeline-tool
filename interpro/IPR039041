{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry include Nav1/2/3 from mammals, unc-53 from C. elegans. They contain a calponin homology (CH) domain in the N terminus, several coiled-coil regions, polyproline rich SH3 binding motifs, and an ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities domain (AAA domain) [[cite:PUB00088809]]. They are required for the migration of cells and neuronal processes. Nav2 has been shown to rescue the mechanosensory neuron outgrowth defects of unc-53 mutants [[cite:PUB00088808]]. Unc-53 has been found to bind to ABI-1, a regulator of Arp2/3 mediated actin filament nucleation [[cite:PUB00088807]]. The Drosophila Nav2 homologue Sickie, also included in this family, regulates F-actin-mediated axonal growth [[cite:PUB00089497]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12784" "STEERIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nav/unc-53 family", "short" "Nav/unc-53"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 989, "taxa" 3883, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8315, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8315, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1108}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
