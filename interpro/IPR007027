{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the poxvirus Protein F11 from Vaccinia virus, also known as Protein OPG055, and similar sequences from poxvirus. They are early virus proteins. F11 stimulates increases in peripheral microtubule dynamics and may increase the motility of the infected cells, contributing to cell-to-cell spread of the virus. It seems to inhibit the signalling via the GTPase RHOA and DIAPH1/mDia [[cite:PUB00103604], [cite:PUB00103603]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04943" "Poxvirus F11 protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015981" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, VAC_F11L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus F11", "short" "Poxvirus_F11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 141, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 178, "sets" 0, "proteins" 175, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007027", :literature {"PUB00103604" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Morales I" "Carbajal MA" "Bohn S" "Holzer D" "Kato SE" "Greco FA" "Moussatche N" "Krijnse Locker J."], "ISO_journal" "Traffic", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Traffic", "title" "The vaccinia virus F11L gene product facilitates cell detachment and promotes migration.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1283-98", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18485055}, "PUB00103603" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Arakawa Y" "Cordeiro JV" "Way M."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "F11L-mediated inhibition of RhoA-mDia signaling stimulates microtubule dynamics during vaccinia virus infection.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "213-26", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18005700}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR007027", "name" "Poxvirus F11", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 31}}}
