{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the adaptive-response sensory-kinase SasA family, a member of the two-component regulatory system SasA/RpaA involved in genome-wide circadian gene expression [[cite:PUB00103628]]. This family of proteins participate in the kaiABC clock protein complex, which constitutes the main circadian regulator in cyanobacteria, via its interaction with kaiC [[cite:PUB00054600]]. It is required for robustness of the circadian rhythm of gene expression and involved in clock output [[cite:PUB00103555], [cite:PUB00103629]]. The kaiABC complex has a core comprising a kaiC homohexamer, a kaiB dimer and two kaiA dimers. KaiC enhances the autophosphorylation activity of SasA, which then transfers its phosphate group to RpaA to activate it. Proteins in this entry contain a histidine kinase domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01837" "Adaptive-response sensory-kinase SasA [sasA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adaptive-response sensory-kinase SasA", "short" "Kinase_SasA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 174, "taxa" 1071, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 619, "sets" 0, "proteins" 619, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 436}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
