{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Nuclear speckles are subnuclear storage sites containing pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Nuclear speckle splicing regulatory protein 1 (Nsrp1), also known as NSRP70, is a nuclear speckle-related protein that mediates alternative splice site selection, targeting several pre-mRNAs [[cite:PUB00093376]]. It contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain that is critical not only for self-oligomerization but also for splicing activity. It interacts physically with two SR (serine/arginine) proteins, SRSF1 and SRSF2, and reverses their splicing activity in terms of CD44 exon v5 as exon exclusion [[cite:PUB00093375]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31938" "NUCLEAR SPECKLE SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear speckle splicing regulatory protein 1", "short" "Nsrp1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1002, "taxa" 4160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1736, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1736, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1174}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042816", :literature {"PUB00093376" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Kim YD" "Lee JY" "Oh KM" "Araki M" "Araki K" "Yamamura K" "Jun CD."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "NSrp70 is a novel nuclear speckle-related protein that modulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing in vivo.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "4300-14", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21296756}, "PUB00093375" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kim CH" "Kim YD" "Choi EK" "Kim HR" "Na BR" "Im SH" "Jun CD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
