{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are ABC transporter permease subunits restricted to the Archaea. Several lines of evidence suggest this protein is functionally analogous, as well as homologous, to the UrtC subunit of the Corynebacterium glutamicum urea transporter. All members of the operon show sequence similarity to urea transport subunits, the gene is located near the urease structural subunits in two of three species, and partial phylogenetic profiling identifies this permease subunit as closely matching the profile of urea utilisation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03727" "urea ABC transporter, permease protein UrtC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, urea permease, UrtC", "short" "ABC_trnspt_urea_permease_UrtC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 55, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0743", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0743"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022497", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001851", "name" "ABC transporter, permease", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017779", "name" "ABC transporter, urea permease protein UrtB, bacterial-type", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR019924", "name" "ABC transporter, urea permease protein UrtB, archaeal", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR022497", "name" "ABC transporter, urea permease, UrtC", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR043428", "name" "High-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system permease protein LivM-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017778", "name" "ABC transporter, urea, permease protein, UrtC", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR053777", "name" "Galactofuranose transporter permease protein YtfT", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
