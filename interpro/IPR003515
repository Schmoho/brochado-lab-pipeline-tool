There are twelve spikes formed by five G proteins, each a tight Î² barrel, and one H protein [[cite:PUB00062408], [cite:PUB00062409]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029053", "name" "Viral coat protein subunit", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016184", "name" "Capsid/spike protein, ssDNA virus", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004159" "Major spike protein G"}, "pfam" {"PF02306" "Major spike protein (G protein)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Major spike protein G", "short" "Spike_G"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 81, "taxa" 718, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 291, "sets" 0, "proteins" 291, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 151}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003515", :literature {"PUB00062408" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Inagaki M" "Tanaka A" "Suzuki R" "Wakashima H" "Kawaura T" "Karita S" "Nishikawa S" "Kashimura N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
