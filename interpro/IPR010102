{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) is one of three enzymes constituting 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) degradation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, catalysing the (NAD(P)+)-dependent catabolism reaction of succinate semialdehyde to succinate for metabolism by the citric acid cycle. In Escherichia coli, SSADH is located in a unidirectionally transcribed gene cluster encoding enzymes for GABA degradation and is suggested to be co-transcribed with succinate semialdehyde transaminase from a common promoter upstream of SSADH [[cite:PUB00000167]].
