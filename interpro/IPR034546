In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes are separated into two daughter cells. In meiosis II, the sister chromosomes are then separated into newly formed daughter cells. During prophase I, several events occurs: sister chromatid cohesion, homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, crossover formation and chromosome segregation. Homologous recombination is initiated from the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The formation of DSBs is catalyzed by Spo11 and its homologues. So far, six Arabidopsis proteins,  AtSPO11-1, AtSPO11-2, AtPRD1, AtPRD2, AtPRD3 and AtDFO,  have been shown to be involved in DSB formation [[cite:PUB00097637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37695" "RECOMBINATION INITIATION DEFECTS 3-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein PAIR1", "short" "PAIR1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 223, "taxa" 833, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 659, "sets" 0, "proteins" 659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 386}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034546", :literature {"PUB00083697" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Nonomura K" "Nakano M" "Fukuda T" "Eiguchi M" "Miyao A" "Hirochika H" "Kurata N."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.020701", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1008-20", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15031413}, "PUB00097637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tang Y" "Yin Z" "Zeng Y" "Zhang Q" "Chen L" "He Y" "Lu P" "Ye" "Zhang X."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "MTOPVIB interacts with AtPRD1 and plays important roles in formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "10007", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28855712}, "PUB00087070" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["De Muyt A" "Pereira L" "Vezon D" "Chelysheva L" "Gendrot G" "Chambon A" "Laine-Choinard S" "Pelletier G" "Mercier R" "Nogue F" "Grelon M."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Genet.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000654", "medline_journal" "PLoS Genet", "title" "A high throughput genetic screen identifies new early meiotic recombination functions in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "e1000654", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19763177}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0048236", "name" "plant-type sporogenesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0070192", "name" "chromosome organization involved in meiotic cell cycle", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR034546", "name" "Protein PAIR1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
