{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Occludin was the first molecular component of the tight junction to be identified. These are specialised membrane domains that form intercellular contacts between epithelial cells and create a regulated barrier to the paracellular movement of water, solutes and immune cells. They also provide a second type of barrier that contributes to cell polarity by restricting the lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins within cell membranes [[cite:PUB00005987]]. Occludin is an ~65kDa type II integral membrane protein, which has been shown to have four transmembrane (TM) domains, two extracellular loops and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini. The extracellular loops are chemically quite distinctive, particularly the first, which has an unusually high content of tyrosine and glycine residues (~65%) that alternate along the sequence [[cite:PUB00005987]]. Gene knockout experiments have suggested occludin is an accessory, rather than principal, structural component of tight junctions, since occludin-deficient cells are still able to form tight junctions when cultured in vitro [[cite:PUB00005988]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01258" "OCCLUDIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005993" "Occludin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Occludin", "short" "Occludin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 435, "taxa" 1657, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1772, "sets" 0, "proteins" 857, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 534}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002958", :literature {"PUB00005987" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Fanning AS" "Mitic LL" "Anderson JM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
