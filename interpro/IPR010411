{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tail assembly chaperones (TACs) are required for the morphogenesis of all long-tailed phages. Gp13, a TAC from bacteriophage HK97, is required for tail tube assembly and is thought to be a TAC. The gp13 monomer comprises a single domain consisting of a small three-stranded twisted Î²-sheet connected to a helical bundle. Gp13 adopts a spiral quaternary structure, similar to other TACs [[cite:PUB00075454]].
