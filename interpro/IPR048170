{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins, found in Bacillales, that are homologous to SosA. SosA is a cell division inhibitor that blocks cell division in response to DNA damage [[cite:PUB00151411]]. SosA is a small, predicted membrane protein with an extracellular C-terminal domain in which the conserved residues are essential for the inhibitory activity. SosA halts cell division and synchronises the cell population at a stage where division proteins such as FtsZ and EzrA are localised at midcell, and the septum formation is initiated but unable to progress to closure [[cite:PUB00151411]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041581" "DNA damage-induced cell division inhibitor SosA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA damage-induced cell division inhibitor SosA-like", "short" "SosA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 116, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 127, "sets" 0, "proteins" 127, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 94}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048170", :literature {"PUB00151411" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Bojer MS" "Wacnik K" "Kjelgaard P" "Gallay C" "Bottomley AL" "Cohn MT" "Lindahl G" "Frees D" "Veening JW" "Foster SJ" "Ingmer H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "SosA inhibits cell division in Staphylococcus aureus in response to DNA damage.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "1116-1130", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31290194}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048170", "name" "DNA damage-induced cell division inhibitor SosA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
