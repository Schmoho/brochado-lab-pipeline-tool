{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1 or PDPK1) and related kinases from yeast: Pkh1 and Pkh2 from S. cerevisiae, which function similarly to PDK1 [[cite:PUB00088816]], and Ksg1 [[cite:PUB00088817]] and Ppk21 from S. pombe [[cite:PUB00088819]].</p>\n\n<p>PDK1 is the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on the activation loop, at threonine 308, which is essential for Akt activation [[cite:PUB00088820], [cite:PUB00088821]]. Beyond Akt, PDK1 is responsible for the phosphorylation of many other AGC kinases including serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK) [[cite:PUB00088826]] and the members of protein kinase C (PKC) family [[cite:PUB00088828]]. PDK1 is implicated in signaling pathways frequently altered in cancer, such as PI3K/Akt, Ras/MAPK and Myc [[cite:PUB00088824]]. It is a key regulator of cell migration and tumor invasion [[cite:PUB00088823]]. PDK1 binds to the insulin receptor, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 by the insulin receptor, which is necessary for insulin metabolic signaling [[cite:PUB00088830]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1uu9", "name" "Structure of human PDK1 kinase domain in complex with BIM-3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05581" "Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine Kinase, Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PDPK1 family", "short" "PDPK1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 66, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2298, "taxa" 7843, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5059, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5058, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3078}, "pathways" 103}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2088", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2088"} {"accession" "GenProp2090", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2090"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
