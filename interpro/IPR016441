{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes yeast TEL2-interacting protein 1 (Tti1) and its homologues from animals. Budding yeast Tti1 is a subunit of the ASTRA complex, which is involved in chromatin remodelling [[cite:PUB00054175]]. Human Tti1 homologue is part of the TTT complex that is required to stabilise protein levels of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family proteins. The TTT complex is involved in the cellular resistance to DNA damage stresses, like ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet (UV) and mitomycin C (MMC) [[cite:PUB00073582]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005250" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP005250 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TEL2-interacting protein 1", "short" "Tti1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 854, "taxa" 2717, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1290, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1239, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 824}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016441", :literature {"PUB00054175" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Shevchenko A" "Roguev A" "Schaft D" "Buchanan L" "Habermann B" "Sakalar C" "Thomas H" "Krogan NJ" "Shevchenko A" "Stewart AF."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-11-r167", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "Chromatin Central: towards the comparative proteome by accurate mapping of the yeast proteomic environment.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "R167", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19040720}, "PUB00073582" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Hurov KE" "Cotta-Ramusino C" "Elledge SJ."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1934210", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "A genetic screen identifies the Triple T complex required for DNA damage signaling and ATM and ATR stability.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1939-50", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20810650}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016441", "name" "TEL2-interacting protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
