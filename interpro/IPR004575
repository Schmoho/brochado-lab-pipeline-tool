{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>MAT1/Tfb3 acts as component of the general transcription and DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH), which is essential for both basal and activated transcription, and is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA [[cite:PUB00062852]]. \r\n\r\nIt is a RING finger protein with a characteristic C3HC4 motif located in the N-terminal domain. MAT1/Tfb3 stabilises the cyclin H-CDK7 complex to form a functional CDK-activating kinase (CAK) enzymatic complex which then goes on to activate many of the CDK enzymes intimately involved in the cell cycle [[cite:PUB00007681]]. CDK7 forms a stable complex with cyclin H and MAT1/Tfb3 in vivo only when phosphorylated on either one of two residues (Ser164 or Thr170) in its T-loop. The requirement for MAT1/Tfb3 for the activation of CAK can be by-passed by the phosphorylation of CDK7 on the T-loop.  The two mechanisms for CDK7 complex stabilisation and activation (MAT1 addition and T-loop phosphorylation), which can operate independently in vitro, actually cooperate under physiological conditions to maintain complex integrity. With prolonged exposure to elevated temperature, dissociation to monomeric subunits occurs in vivo when CDK7 is dephosphorylated, even in the presence of MAT1/Tfb3 [[cite:PUB00007682]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003338" "CDK-activating kinase assembly factor MAT1"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00570" "CDK-activating kinase assembly factor MAT1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cdk-activating kinase assembly factor MAT1/Tfb3", "short" "MAT1/Tfb3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 51, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1991, "taxa" 6631, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3107, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3043, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1987}, "pathways" 85}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2049", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2049"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004575", :literature {"PUB00007681" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Schultz P" "Fribourg S" "Poterszman A" "Mallouh V" "Moras D" "Egly JM."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00082-9", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Molecular structure of human TFIIH.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "599-607", "volume" "102", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11007478}, "PUB00007682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Larochelle S" "Chen J" "Knights R" "Pandur J" "Morcillo P" "Erdjument-Bromage H" "Tempst P" "Suter B" "Fisher RP."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/20.14.3749", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "T-loop phosphorylation stabilizes the CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex in vivo and regulates its CTD kinase activity.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "3749-59", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11447116}, "PUB00062852" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Feaver WJ" "Henry NL" "Wang Z" "Wu X" "Svejstrup JQ" "Bushnell DA" "Friedberg EC" "Kornberg RD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
