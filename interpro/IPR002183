{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukin-3 (IL3) is a cytokine that regulates blood-cell production by controlling the production, differentiation and function of granulocytes and macrophages [[cite:PUB00001758], [cite:PUB00003991]]. The protein, which exists in vivo as a monomer, is produced in activated T-cells and mast cells [[cite:PUB00001758], [cite:PUB00003991]], and is activated by the cleavage of an N-terminal signal sequence [[cite:PUB00003991]].</p>\r\n<p>IL3 is produced by T-lymphocytes and T-lymphomas only after stimulation with antigens, mitogens, or chemical activators such as phorbol esters. However, IL3 is constitutively expressed in the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line WEHI-3B [[cite:PUB00003991]]. It is thought that the genetic change of the cell line to constitutive production of IL3 is the key event in development of this leukaemia [[cite:PUB00003991]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48489" "INTERLEUKIN-3"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001939" "Interleukin-3"}, "prints" {"PR00430" "INTERLEUKIN3"}, "pfam" {"PF02059" "Interleukin-3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-3", "short" "IL-3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 72, "taxa" 295, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 116, "sets" 0, "proteins" 114, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 93}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002183", :literature {"PUB00001758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Dorssers L" "Burger H" "Bot F" "Delwel R" "Geurts van Kessel AH" "Lowenberg B" "Wagemaker G."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(87)90254-X", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Characterization of a human multilineage-colony-stimulating factor cDNA clone identified by a conserved noncoding sequence in mouse interleukin-3.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "115-24", "volume" "55", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3497843}, "PUB00003991" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6034", "authors" ["Ymer S" "Tucker WQ" "Sanderson CJ" "Hapel AJ" "Campbell HD" "Young IG."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/317255a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Constitutive synthesis of interleukin-3 by leukaemia cell line WEHI-3B is due to retroviral insertion near the gene.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "255-8", "volume" "317", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2413359}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005135", "name" "interleukin-3 receptor binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0008083", "name" "growth factor activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006955", "name" "immune response", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005576", "name" "extracellular region", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002183", "name" "Interleukin-3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 79}}}
