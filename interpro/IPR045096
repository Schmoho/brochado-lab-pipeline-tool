{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes EDR2 and EDR2L from Arabidopsis. They contain a pleckstrin homology and a StAR transfer (START) domain as well as a plant-specific domain of unknown function, DUF1336. EDR2 is a negative regulator of the salicylic acid- (SA-) mediated resistance to pathogens, including the biotrophic powdery mildew pathogens Golovinomyces cichoracearum and Blumeria graminis, and the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica, probably by limiting the initiation of cell death and the establishment of the hypersensitive response (HR) [[cite:PUB00078901], [cite:PUB00095635]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12136" "ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 2-like", "short" "EDR2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 372, "taxa" 1630, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5696, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5696, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3587}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045096", :literature {"PUB00078901" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Tang D" "Ade J" "Frye CA" "Innes RW."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02523.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Regulation of plant defense responses in Arabidopsis by EDR2, a PH and START domain-containing protein.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "245-57", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16212604}, "PUB00095635" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Vorwerk S" "Schiff C" "Santamaria M" "Koh S" "Nishimura M" "Vogel J" "Somerville C" "Somerville S."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "title" "EDR2 negatively regulates salicylic acid-based defenses and cell death during powdery mildew infections of Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "35", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17612410}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045096", "name" "Protein ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
