{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The lethal(2)giant larvae protein (Lgl) of Drosophila is essential for polarised epithelia development, for cell polarity associated with asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts during development and for oocyte polarity formation. As a result of alternative splicing Lgl has two isoforms that differ in their C-terminal region, isoform p78 which has an essential role in control of cell proliferation and differentiation during development as well as in controlling membrane trafficking underlying axonal growth and acts as a tumour suppressor [[cite:PUB00000814], [cite:PUB00005948], [cite:PUB00094511]]; and isoform p127 which has an accessory function in cell proliferation control and differentiation during development. These proteins, and their homologues, contain conserved functional domains such as homo-oligomerization domains, a cluster of phosphorylation sites and at least two WD-40 repeats, which suggests that these proteins have closely related functions [[cite:PUB00094512], [cite:PUB00094513]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00962" "LETHAL2GIANT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lethal(2) giant larvae protein", "short" "Lethal2_giant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1011, "taxa" 4339, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50083, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9004, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4949}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000664", :literature {"PUB00000814" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jacob L" "Opper M" "Metzroth B" "Phannavong B" "Mechler BM."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(87)90217-0", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Structure of the l(2)gl gene of Drosophila and delimitation of its tumor suppressor domain.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "215-25", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3036370}, "PUB00094512" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kuphal S" "Wallner S" "Schimanski CC" "Bataille F" "Hofer P" "Strand S" "Strand D" "Bosserhoff AK."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Expression of Hugl-1 is strongly reduced in malignant melanoma.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "103-10", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16170365}, "PUB00094511" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wang T" "Liu Y" "Xu XH" "Deng CY" "Wu KY" "Zhu J" "Fu XQ" "He M" "Luo ZG."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
