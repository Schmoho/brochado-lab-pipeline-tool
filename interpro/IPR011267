{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These vegatative storage proteins are close relatives of the plant acid phosphatases ([interpro:IPR010028]) and are limited to members of the Phaseoleae including Glycine max (Soybean) and Phaseolus vulgaris (Kidney bean).  These proteins are highly expressed in the leaves of repeatedly depodded plants [[cite:PUB00008422], [cite:PUB00014554]].  Vegetative storage protein (VSP) differs most strikingly from the acid phosphatases in the lack of the conserved nucleophilic aspartate residue in the N terminus, thus, they should be inactive as phosphatases.   This issue was confused by the publication in 1992 of an article claiming activity for the G. max VSP.  In 1994 this assertion was refuted by the separation of the activity from the VSP [[cite:PUB00014555]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01680" "vegetative storage protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vegetative storage protein", "short" "Veg_Stor_Prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 43, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30, "sets" 0, "proteins" 30, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011267", :literature {"PUB00014554" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Staswick PE."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.2.1.1", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Novel Regulation of Vegetative Storage Protein Genes.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "1-6", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12354941}, "PUB00014555" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Staswick PE" "Papa C" "Huang JF" "Rhee Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=12232060", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Purification of the Major Soybean Leaf Acid Phosphatase That Is Increased by Seed-Pod Removal.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "49-57", "volume" "104", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12232060}, "PUB00008422" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["DeWald DB" "Mason HS" "Mullet JE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
