{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Metallothioneins (MT) are small proteins that bind heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, cadmium, nickel, etc. They have a high content of cysteine residues that bind the metal ions through clusters of thiolate bonds [[cite:PUB00000300], [cite:PUB00001490], [cite:PUB00003570]]. The metallothionein superfamily comprises all polypeptides that resemble equine renal metallothionein in several respects, e.g. low molecular weight; high metal content; amino acid composition with high Cys and low aromatic residue content; unique sequence with characteristic distribution of cysteines, and spectroscopic manifestations indicative of metal thiolate clusters. A MT family subsumes MTs that share particular sequence-specific features and are thought to be evolutionarily related. Fifteen MT families have been characterised, \r\neach family being identified by its number and its taxonomic range.</p>\r\n<p>Nematode (family 6) MTs are 62-74 residue proteins, containing 18 conserved cysteines and binding 6 cadmium ions. The protein also binds cations of several transition elements. The cysteine residues are arranged in C-X-C and X-C-C-X groups. In particular, the consensus pattern K-C-C-x(3)-C-C has been found to be diagnostic of family 6 metallothioneins. The protein is induced by cadmium, and is abundantly and exclusively expressed in the intestinal cells of larvae and adult animals [[cite:PUB00002813]]. Subfamilies of this family, n1 and n2, hit the same entry. It is known that the identity between n1 and n2 is about 60% and n2 is longer than n1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00876" "MTNEMATODE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Metallothionein, family 6, nematoda", "short" "Metalthion_nemt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 74, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 98, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000853", :literature {"PUB00000300" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Kagi JH" "Schaffer A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00423a001", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Biochemistry of metallothionein.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "8509-15", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3064814}, "PUB00001490" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kagi JH" "Kojima Y."], "ISO_journal" "Experientia Suppl.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Experientia Suppl", "title" "Chemistry and biochemistry of metallothionein.", "year" 1987, "raw_pages" "25-61", "volume" "52", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2959513}, "PUB00003570" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kagi JH."], "ISO_journal" "Meth.
