{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Patched (Ptc) is a Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly) membrane protein that plays a critical role in patterning embryonic and imaginal tissues. It constitutively inactivates the transcription of genes wingless, decapentaplegic, and patched itself. The secreted protein, hedgehog (Hh) induces transcription of genes by opposing the patched signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00035901]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, mutations affecting patched (Ptc) or smoothened (Smo) homologues that trigger ligand-independent activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway are associated with tumours such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma [[cite:PUB00035902]].</p>\n\n<p>Patched is associated with a complex belonging to the hedgehog pathway. Members of the complex include cubitus interruptus, sex-lethal, patched and smoothened. The complex is present at the plasma membrane and the association of patched changes depending on the activation state of the pathway [[cite:PUB00035903]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00918" "transmembrane receptor Patched"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane receptor, patched", "short" "TM_rcpt_patched"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 723, "taxa" 2808, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2979, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2978, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 728}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004766", :literature {"PUB00035901" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Johnson RL" "Grenier JK" "Scott MP."], "ISO_journal" "Development", "DOI_URL" "http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/121/12/4161", "medline_journal" "Development", "title" "patched overexpression alters wing disc size and pattern: transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects on hedgehog targets.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "4161-70", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8575316}, "PUB00035902" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6900", "authors" ["Taipale J" "Cooper MK" "Maiti T" "Beachy PA."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature00989", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Patched acts catalytically to suppress the activity of Smoothened.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "892-7", "volume" "418", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12192414}, "PUB00035903" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 5", "authors" ["Walthall SL" "Moses M" "Horabin JI."], "ISO_journal" "J.
