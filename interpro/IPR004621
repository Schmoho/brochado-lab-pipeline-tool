{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family that includes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.</p>\n\n<p>The enzyme activities methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ([ec:1.5.1.20]) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH) ([ec:1.7.99.5]) differ in that the former (assigned in many eukaryotes) is defined to use NADP+ as an acceptor, while the latter (assigned in many bacteria) is flexible with respect to the acceptor. Both convert       5-methyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. From a larger set of proteins assigned as one or the other, this family describes the subset of proteins found in eukaryotes, and currently designated methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase([ec:1.5.1.20]).
