{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme [ec:1.97.1.4] is a 28kDa monomeric protein which is involved in the anerobic glucose metabolism pathway. It is a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine family of enzymes which initiate radical catalysis.  It is necessary to activate pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), which catalyses the conversion of pyruvate and coenzyme A to formate and acetyl CoA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme functions by catalysing the formation of the Gly734 radical of PFL. It utilises a [4Fe-4S] cluster and adenosylmethionine to generate a putative adenosyl radical, which extracts a hydrogen atom from Gly734 on PFL, thus activating PFL for catalysis [[cite:PUB00044952]]. Members of this family are iron-sulphur proteins with a radical-SAM domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8fsi", "name" "The structure of a crystallizable variant of E. coli pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme bound to SAM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02493" "pyruvate formate-lyase-activating protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyruvate formate-lyase 1 activating enzyme", "short" "PFL1_activating"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2330, "taxa" 9758, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9174, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9174, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6988}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0943", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0943"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
