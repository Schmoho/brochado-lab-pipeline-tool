{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Type III secretion chaperones are involved in delivering virulence effector proteins from bacterial pathogens directly into eukaryotic cells. The chaperones may prevent aggregation and degradation of their substrates, may target the effector to the secretion apparatus, and may ensure a secretion-component unfolded conformation of their specific substrate. One member of this family, SigE ([swissprot:O30917]) forms homodimers in crystal. The monomers have a novel fold with an α-β(3)-α-β(2)-α topology [[cite:PUB00016448]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1k3s", "name" "Type III Secretion Chaperone SigE"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17022" "Class IA type III secretion system chaperone protein, similar to Salmonella enterica SigE"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF034754" "Secretion chaperone protein SigE"}, "pfam" {"PF07824" "Type III secretion chaperone domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system chaperone", "short" "T3SS_chaperone"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 369, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 451, "sets" 0, "proteins" 451, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 406}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013095", :literature {"PUB00016448" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Luo Y" "Bertero MG" "Frey EA" "Pfuetzner RA" "Wenk MR" "Creagh L" "Marcus SL" "Lim D" "Sicheri F" "Kay C" "Haynes C" "Finlay BB" "Strynadka NC."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
