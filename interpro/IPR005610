{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the low molecular weight transmembrane protein Psb28 (PsbW), one of the assembly factors of photosystem II (PSII). Psb28 is involved in guiding PSII biogenesis and assembly, stabilising dimeric PSII [[cite:PUB00015376], [cite:PUB00152828]], and facilitating PSII repair after photo-inhibition [[cite:PUB00015377]]. When Psb28 binds the membrane-intrinsic antenna protein CP47, it induces large conformational changes at the PSII acceptor side, which distort the binding pocket of the mobile quinone (QB) and replace the bicarbonate ligand of non-haem iron with glutamate, a structural motif found in reaction centres of non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria [[cite:PUB00152828]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems (I and II) located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae. Photosystem II (PSII) has a P680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll 'a' that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation (splitting) of water molecules, and to produce ATP via a proton pump. Photosystem I (PSI) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated hydrogen donated from PSII to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by PSII, releasing oxygen as a by-product [[cite:PUB00152828]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>PSII is a multisubunit protein-pigment complex containing polypeptides both intrinsic and extrinsic to the photosynthetic membrane [[cite:PUB00152828], [cite:PUB00015357], [cite:PUB00015358], [cite:PUB00097583]]. Within the core of the complex, the chlorophyll and Î²-carotene pigments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins CP43 (PsbC) and CP47 (PsbB), which pass the excitation energy on to the reaction centre proteins D1 (Qb, PsbA) and D2 (Qa, PsbD) that bind all the redox-active cofactors involved in the energy conversion process. The PSII oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) oxidises water to provide protons for use by PSI, and consists of OEE1 (PsbO), OEE2 (PsbP) and OEE3 (PsbQ).
