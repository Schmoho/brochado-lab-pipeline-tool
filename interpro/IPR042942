{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Laforin (encoded by the EPM2A gene) is a protein phosphatase and one of the two proteins (the other one is malin, a E3-ubiquitin ligase) that is defective in Lafora disease (LD), a progressive form of inherited epilepsy associated with widespread neurodegeneration and the formation of polyglucosan bodies in the neurons [[cite:PUB00093510]]. Laforin and malin form a functional complex, in which laforin could recognize and recruit putative substrates to be ubiquitinated by malin for degradation. The Laforin-malin complex regulates glycogen synthesis through targeting R5/PTG (Protein Targeting to Glycogen) for inactivation, most probably by proteolysis. Moreover, the Laforin-Malin complex is also involved in different pathways, such as intracellular protein degradation, oxidative stress, and the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response [[cite:PUB00093509]]. It contains a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) at the N terminus and a dual specificity phosphatase domain (DSP) at the C terminus. The structure of Laforin has been revealed [[cite:PUB00093508]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029021", "name" "Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46864" "LAFORIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Laforin", "short" "Laforin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 647, "taxa" 2212, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1000, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1000, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 723}, "pathways" 37}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
