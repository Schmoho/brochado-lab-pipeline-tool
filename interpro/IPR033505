{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The USPL1 peptidase (MEROPS identifier C98.001) is an isopeptidase that releases the SUMO protein from tagged proteins [[cite:PUB00069614]].   USPL1 does not release ubiquitin from conjugates [[cite:PUB00069614]].  USPL1 colocalizes with coilin in Cajal body [[cite:PUB00069614]].  RNAi knockdown of USPL1 leads to disruption of Cajal bodies, relocalization of coilin to the nucleolus and impaired cell proliferation [[cite:PUB00069614]].  These effects do not require USPL1 to be catalytically active, and further studies have shown that USPL1 plays a role in snRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II [[cite:PUB00078952]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cajal bodies are spherical sub-organelles of 0.3-1.0 micrometers in diameter found in the nucleus of proliferative cells such as embryonic and tumour cells, or metabolically active cells such as neurons, involved in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and spliceosomal small nuclear RNP biogenesis, maintenance of telomeres and processing of histone RNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7p99", "name" "Structure of human USPL1 in complex with SUMO2"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15294" "RETINOVIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "USPL1 peptidase", "short" "USPL1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 665, "taxa" 2405, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1159, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 728}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
