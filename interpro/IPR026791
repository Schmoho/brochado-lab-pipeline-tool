{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DOCK family members are evolutionarily conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-family GTPases [[cite:PUB00014935]]. DOCK proteins are required during several cellular processes, such as cell motility and phagocytosis. The N-terminal SH3 domain of the DOCK proteins functions as an inhibitor of GEF, which can be relieved upon its binding to the ELMO1-3 adaptor proteins, after their binding to active RhoG at the plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00073863], [cite:PUB00073862]]. DOCK family proteins are categorised into four subfamilies based on their sequence homology: DOCK-A subfamily (DOCK1/180, 2, 5), DOCK-B subfamily (DOCK3, 4), DOCK-C subfamily (DOCK6, 7, 8), DOCK-D subfamily (DOCK9, 10, 11) [[cite:PUB00014935]]. All DOCKs contain two homology domains: the DHR-1 (Dock homology region-1), also called CZH1 (CED-5, Dock180, and MBC-zizimin homology 1), and DHR-2 (also called CZH2 or Docker).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7cly", "name" "Structure of the DOCK8 DHR-1 domain crystallized with di-C8-phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043161", "name" "Dedicator of cytokinesis, C-terminal, lobe A", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042455", "name" "Dedicator of cytokinesis, N-terminal, subdomain 1", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043162", "name" "Dedicator of cytokinesis, C-terminal, lobe C", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45653" "DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS", "PTHR23317" "DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS DOCK"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dedicator of cytokinesis", "short" "DOCK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2452, "taxa" 8332, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34616, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34616, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8453}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026791", :literature {"PUB00073862" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lu M" "Kinchen JM" "Rossman KL" "Grimsley C" "Hall M" "Sondek J" "Hengartner MO" "Yajnik V" "Ravichandran KS."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
