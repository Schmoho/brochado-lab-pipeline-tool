{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, ureolytic bacteria that can colonise the human stomach. It does not survive in a medium with a pH less than 4.0 unless urea is present, preferring a neutral pH. Gastric juice urea is able to rapidly access intrabacterial urease when the periplasmic pH falls below approximately 6.2 owing to pH-gating of a urea channel, UreI. UreI is a six-transmembrane segment protein that is homologous to the amiS genes of the amidase gene cluster and to UreI of Helicobacter hepaticus and Streptococcus salivarius. UreI in H. pylori and H. hepaticus can transport urea only at acidic pH, whereas that of S. salivarius is open at both neutral and acidic pH [[cite:PUB00043489]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amiS gene encodes an 18kDa protein with a high content of hydrophobic residues. It has six transmembrane helices. AmiB and AmiS resemble two components of an ABC transporter system [[cite:PUB00043490]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This family includes UreI and proton gated urea channel as well as putative amide transporters [[cite:PUB00006468]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038523", "name" "AmiS/UreI transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02293" "AmiS/UreI family transporter"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AmiS/UreI transporter", "short" "AmiSUreI_transpt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 431, "taxa" 2197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2040, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2040, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1653}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003211", :literature {"PUB00006468" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5452", "authors" ["Weeks DL" "Eskandari S" "Scott DR" "Sachs G."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.287.5452.482", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "A H+-gated urea channel: the link between Helicobacter pylori urease and gastric colonization.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "482-5", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10642549}, "PUB00043489" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Sachs G" "Weeks DL" "Melchers K" "Scott DR."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
