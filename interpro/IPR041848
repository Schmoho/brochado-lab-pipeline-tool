{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Yeast guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma (Ste18) is part of the G protein heterotrimer (made up of subunits alpha, beta and gamma) in the yeast pheromone response pathway. Receptor Ste2 is activated by mating pheromone, leading to GTP binding. This binding causes the beta and gamma subunits to dissociate from subunit alpha, with the resulting beta-gamma dimer functioning as the signal-transmitting component [[cite:PUB00091963]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036284", "name" "G-protein gamma-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28189" "GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN SUBUNIT GAMMA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma, fungal", "short" "Ste18_fungal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1001, "taxa" 2774, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1655, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1655, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1038}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041848", :literature {"PUB00091963" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5804", "authors" ["Slessareva JE" "Dohlman HG."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1134041", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "G protein signaling in yeast: new components, new connections, new compartments.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1412-3", "volume" "314", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17138892}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0031681", "name" "G-protein beta-subunit binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000750", "name" "pheromone-dependent signal transduction involved in conjugation with cellular fusion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0007186", "name" "G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR041848", "name" "Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma, fungal", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
