{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase, aslo known as Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase ([ec:3.5.99.6]), catalyses the conversion of D-glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) to D-fructose 6-phosphate and ammonium. This is the last step in the pathway for N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAC) utilization in bacteria such as Escherichia coli (gene nagB) or in fungi such as Candida albicans (Yeast) (gene NAG1).   The structure of this enzyme from E. coli (NagB) is described as a modified NAD-binding domain, and undergoes allosteric conformational changes that regulate its function [[cite:PUB00005253]]. The reaction steps involve opening of the pyranose ring of the substrate and a sequence of general base-catalysed reactions to bring about isomerisation and deamination [[cite:PUB00044804]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes a closely related pair of proteins from Bacillus subtilis, one of which is uncharacterised but included as a member of the orthologous set.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bkx", "name" "Structure and kinetics of a monomeric glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase: missing link of the NagB superfamily"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037171", "name" "NagB/RpiA transferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11280" "GLUCOSAMINE-6-PHOSPHATE ISOMERASE"}, "cdd" {"cd01399" "GlcN6P_deaminase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01241" "Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase [nagB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00502" "glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase", "short" "Glucosamine6P_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6273, "taxa" 23962, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28874, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28871, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21361}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00894", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00894"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1303", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1303"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
