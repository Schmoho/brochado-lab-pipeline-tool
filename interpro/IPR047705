{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins found in tailed bacteriophages and prophages mainly found in firmicutes, including AimR transcriptional regulator from Bacillus phage. AimR (arbitrium receptor), which is a part of the so-called phage arbitrium system, is a DNA-binding phage regulatory protein that acts as a receptor for a 6-amino acid signalling peptide cleaved from the C terminus of AimP. AimR controls expression of AimX, the third member of the quorum sensing-like arbitrium system and an inhibitor of phage lysogeny [[cite:PUB00105338]]. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to 'communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.</p>\n\n<p>AimR assembles an α-α superhelix fold and accommodates the signalling peptide encircled by its tetratricopeptide repeats, which is reminiscent of RRNPP family members from the quorum-sensing system [[cite:PUB00151024], [cite:PUB00151049]]. With or without the peptide, AimR dimerises through the C-terminal capping helix. It contains HTH motif at the N terminus that is crucial for DNA targeting.</p>\n\n<p>This group of proteins also includes YopK from Bacillus subtilis [[cite:PUB00151049]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6im4", "name" "Structural basis of AimP signaling molecule recognition by AimR in Spbeta group of bacteriophages"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038310" "AimR family lysis-lysogeny pheromone receptor"}, "pfam" {"PF22871" "AimR transcriptional regulator-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AimR transcriptional regulator-like", "short" "AimR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 143, "taxa" 560, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1179, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 544}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047705", :literature {"PUB00151024" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Wang Q" "Guan Z" "Pei K" "Wang J" "Liu Z" "Yin P" "Peng D" "Zou T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Microbiol", "title" "Structural basis of the arbitrium peptide-AimR communication system in the phage lysis-lysogeny decision.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1266-1273", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30224798}, "PUB00151049" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gallego Del Sol F" "Penades JR" "Marina A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Deciphering the Molecular Mechanism Underpinning Phage Arbitrium Communication Systems.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "59-72.e3", "volume" "74", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30745087}, "PUB00105338" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7638", "authors" ["Erez Z" "Steinberger-Levy I" "Shamir M" "Doron S" "Stokar-Avihail A" "Peleg Y" "Melamed S" "Leavitt A" "Savidor A" "Albeck S" "Amitai G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Communication between viruses guides lysis-lysogeny decisions.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "488-493", "volume" "541", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28099413}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047705", "name" "AimR transcriptional regulator-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 17, "alignment:full" 186}}}
