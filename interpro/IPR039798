{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains sulfhydryl oxidases that are flavin-dependent [[cite:PUB00043720]].  Sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1 or quiescin Q6) oxidizes sulfhydryl groups in peptide and protein thiols to disulfides with the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, permitting disulfide bond formation.  QSOX1 is predominantly found in the Golgi [[cite:PUB00090112]].  Sulfhydryl oxidase 2 (QSOX2) is predominantly located in the plasma and in the nuclear membrane and regulates the sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis [[cite:PUB00090113]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hf1", "name" "Mutant oxidoreductase fragment of mouse QSOX1 in complex with an antibody Fab"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042568", "name" "Sulfhydryl oxidase, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR22897" "QUIESCIN Q6-RELATED SULFHYDRYL OXIDASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfhydryl oxidase", "short" "Sulfhydryl_oxidase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1403, "taxa" 5612, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5026, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3332}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
