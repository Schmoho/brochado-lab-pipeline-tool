{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Aldose 1-epimerase ([ec:5.1.3.3]) (also known as mutarotase) participates in the Leloir pathway for galactose/glucose interconversion.

The sequence of mutarotase from two bacteria, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Streptococcus thermophilus is available [[cite:PUB00002113]].
