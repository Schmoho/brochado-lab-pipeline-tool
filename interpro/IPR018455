The Man family is unique in several respects among PTS permease families:</p>\r\n\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is the only PTS family in which members possess a IID protein.</li>\r\n<li>It is the only PTS family in which the IIB constituent is phosphorylated on a histidyl rather than a cysteyl residue.</li>\r\n<li>Its permease members exhibit broad specificity for a range of sugars, rather than being specific for just one or a few sugars.</li></ul>\r\n<p>The mannose permease of Escherichia coli, for example, can transport and phosphorylate glucose, mannose, fructose, glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and other sugars. Other members of this can transport sorbose, fructose and N-acetylglucosamine. The active site histidine receives a phosphate group from the IIA subunit and transfers it to the substrate [[cite:PUB00080194]].
