{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>During dissimilatory sulphate reduction and sulphur oxidation, adenylylsulphate (APS) reductase catalyzes reversibly the two-electron reduction of APS to sulphite and AMP. Found in several bacterial lineages and in Archaeoglobales, APS reductase is a heterodimer composed of an alpha subunit containing a noncovalently bound FAD, and a beta subunit containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters.
