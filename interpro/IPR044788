{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including Ole e 10 from Olea europaea (Common olive), and PLASMODESMATA CALLOSE-BINDING PROTEIN 1-8 (PDCB1-8)/CBX8D from Arabidopsis. They contain the carbohydrate-binding module, which is the most common non-catalytic module associated with enzymes active in plant cell-wall hydrolysis. Ole e 10 has been shown to bind preferentially 1,3-beta-glucans. It is a major pollen allergen that may be involved in pollen tube wall re-formation during germination [[cite:PUB00097083]]. In Arabidopsis, PDCBs may be involved in cell-to-cell trafficking regulation [[cite:PUB00097082]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31044" "BETA-1,3 GLUCANASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbohydrate-binding X8 domain-containing protein, plant", "short" "X8_dom_prot"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 250, "taxa" 1039, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9323, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9323, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5556}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044788", :literature {"PUB00097083" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 1", "authors" ["Barral P" "Suarez C" "Batanero E" "Alfonso C" "Alche Jde D" "Rodriguez-Garcia MI" "Villalba M" "Rivas G" "Rodriguez R."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "An olive pollen protein with allergenic activity, Ole e 10, defines a novel family of carbohydrate-binding modules and is potentially implicated in pollen germination.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "77-84", "volume" "390", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15882149}, "PUB00097082" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Simpson C" "Thomas C" "Findlay K" "Bayer E" "Maule AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "An Arabidopsis GPI-anchor plasmodesmal neck protein with callose binding activity and potential to regulate cell-to-cell trafficking.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "581-94", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19223515}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044788", "name" "Carbohydrate-binding X8 domain-containing protein, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
