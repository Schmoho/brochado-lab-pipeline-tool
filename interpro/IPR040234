{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glutaminyl cyclases (QC), which are a subfamily of the peptidase M28 family. Glutaminyl cyclase (QC, QPCT, glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase) [[cite:PUB00090732], [cite:PUB00090726]] and iso-glutaminyl cyclase (QPCTL, isoQC) [[cite:PUB00090733]] catalyze the formation of an N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu) residue from a glutaminyl or glutamyl residue. QC and isoQC are closely related single-zinc metalloenzymes that exhibit nearly identical substrate specificity in vitro [[cite:PUB00090734]]. The major difference refers to subcellular localization: QC is secreted from expressing cells; isoQC is a resident enzyme of the Golgi complex [[cite:PUB00090733]].
