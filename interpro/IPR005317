{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents dipeptidyl peptidase 3 ([ec:3.4.14.4]), the best characterised member of Peptidase family M49. The dipeptidyl peptidase III aminopeptidases are zinc-dependent enzymes that cleave dipeptides from the N-terminal of peptides consisting of four or more amino acids and have a broad specificity. The active site residues occur in the motif HEXXXH which coordinates a single zinc ion via the histidines residues and the glutamic acid acts as a base in peptide hydrolysis [[cite:PUB00089699], [cite:PUB00089698]]. It has been determined a second linear motif in these enzymes, EEXR(K)AE(D), in which the second glutamic acid residue is involved in zinc coordination in the active site [[cite:PUB00089699]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3csk", "name" "Structure of DPP III from Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF007828" "Dipeptidyl-peptidase III"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dipeptidyl-peptidase 3", "short" "Dipeptidyl-peptase3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1407, "taxa" 5072, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3187, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2915, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1729}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
