HisA from Lactococcus lactis was found to be inactive [[cite:PUB00008010]].  The putative HisA from Thermotoga maritima, is a conspicuous outlier to the set of all other HisA, including experimental HisA from the bacterium Escherichia coli and the Archaeaon Methanococcus voltae. Neighbour joining shows HisA from Thermotoga maritima to be within the HisA family (with HisF as an outgroup) but with a long branch.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qo2", "name" "Crystal structure of N-((5'-phosphoribosyl)-formimino)-5-aminoimidazol-4-carboxamid ribonucleotid isomerase (EC 3.1.3.15, HisA)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011060", "name" "Ribulose-phosphate binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00007" "1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5-phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4-carboxamide isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HisA, bacterial-type", "short" "HisA_bact_arch"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5736, "taxa" 23848, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25634, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25634, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19744}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0109", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0109"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
