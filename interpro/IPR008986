{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ebola virus sp. are non-segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses that causes severe haemorrhagic fever in humans with high rates of mortality.  The virus matrix protein VP40 is a major structural protein that plays a central role in virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane of infected cells.  VP40 proteins associate with cellular membranes, interact with the cytoplasmic tails of glycoproteins, and bind to the ribonucleoprotein complex.  The VP40 monomer consists of two domains, the N-terminal oligomerization domain and the C-terminal membrane-binding domain, connected by a flexible linker.  Both the N-and C-terminal domains fold into Î² sandwich structures of similar topology [[cite:PUB00010702]].  Within the N-terminal domain are two overlapping L-domains with the sequences PTAP and PPEY at residues 7 to13, which are required for efficient budding [[cite:PUB00010703]].  L-domains are thought to mediate their function in budding through their interaction with specific host cellular proteins, such as tsg101 and vps-4 [[cite:PUB00010704]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1h2c", "name" "Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 N-terminal domain in complex with RNA (High-resolution VP40[55-194] variant)."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035092", "name" "EV matrix protein, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043079", "name" "EV matrix protein, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038057", "name" "EV matrix domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07447" "Matrix protein VP40"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF018327" "Matrix protein VP40, Filoviridae type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "EV matrix protein", "short" "EV_matrix"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 343, "sets" 0, "proteins" 331, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008986", :literature {"PUB00010702" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Dessen A" "Volchkov V" "Dolnik O" "Klenk HD" "Weissenhorn W."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/19.16.4228", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Crystal structure of the matrix protein VP40 from Ebola virus.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "4228-36", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10944105}, "PUB00010703" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Timmins J" "Schoehn G" "Ricard-Blum S" "Scianimanico S" "Vernet T" "Ruigrok RW" "Weissenhorn W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
