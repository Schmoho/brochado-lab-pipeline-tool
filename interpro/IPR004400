{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Urease is a nickel-binding enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate. The activation of urease requires GTP hydrolysis and the formation of a preactivation complex consisting of apo-urease and urease accessory proteins UreF, UreH, and UreG. UreG is a SIMIBI class GTPase that can be recruited by UreF-UreH complex [[cite:PUB00070746]].</p>\n\n<p>Member of this family is also Ure7 from Cryptococcus neoformans which appears to combine the functions of bacterial UreE and UreG in activating the Ure1 apoenzyme and thus making this pathogen more similar to that seen in the plant system [[cite:PUB00154981]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5xkt", "name" "Klebsiella pneumoniae UreG in complex with GMPPNP and nickel"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31715" "UREASE ACCESSORY PROTEIN G"}, "hamap" {"MF_01389" "Urease accessory protein UreG [ureG]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00101" "urease accessory protein UreG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Urease accessory protein UreG", "short" "UreG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4844, "taxa" 18152, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16210, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16198, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12127}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0051", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0051"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004400", :literature {"PUB00070746" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Fong YH" "Wong HC" "Yuen MH" "Lau PH" "Chen YW" "Wong KB."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001678", "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Structure of UreG/UreF/UreH complex reveals how urease accessory proteins facilitate maturation of Helicobacter pylori urease.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e1001678", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24115911}, "PUB00154981" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Singh A" "Panting RJ" "Varma A" "Saijo T" "Waldron KJ" "Jong A" "Ngamskulrungroj P" "Chang YC" "Rutherford JC" "Kwon-Chung KJ."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00220-13", "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Factors required for activation of urease as a virulence determinant in Cryptococcus neoformans.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e00220-13", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23653445}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003924", "name" "GTPase activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016151", "name" "nickel cation binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0043419", "name" "urea catabolic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004400", "name" "Urease accessory protein UreG", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
