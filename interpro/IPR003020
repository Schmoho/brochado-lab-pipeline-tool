{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) transport mechanisms are the principal regulators of pH in animal cells. Such transport also plays a vital role in acid-base movements in the stomach, pancreas, intestine, kidney, reproductive organs and the central nervous system. Functional studies have suggested four different HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>transport modes. Anion exchanger proteins exchange HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>for Cl<sup>-</sup>in a reversible, electroneutral manner [[cite:PUB00005997]]. Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transport proteins mediate the coupled movement of Na<sup>+</sup>and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>across plasma membranes, often in an electrogenic manner [[cite:PUB00018713]]. Na<sup>+</sup>driven Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>exchange and K<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>exchange activities have also been detected in certain cell types, although the molecular identities of the proteins responsible remain to be determined.</p>\n\n<p>Sequence analysis of the two families of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>transporters that have been cloned to date (the anion exchangers and Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>co-transporters) reveals that they are homologous. This is not entirely unexpected, given that they both transport HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>and are inhibited by a class of pharmacological agents called disulphonic stilbenes [[cite:PUB00006023]]. They share around ~25-30% sequence identity, which is distributed along their entire sequence length, and have similar predicted membrane topologies, suggesting they have ~10 transmembrane (TM) domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00834" "anion exchange protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR11453" "ANION EXCHANGE PROTEIN"}, "prints" {"PR01231" "HCO3TRNSPORT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bicarbonate transporter, eukaryotic", "short" "HCO3_transpt_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 74, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2431, "taxa" 9762, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33797, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31948, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18747}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003020", :literature {"PUB00005997" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kopito RR."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
