{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes PglZ, an alkaline phosphatase-like protein associated with BREX (bacteriophage exclusion) type 1 systems [[cite:PUB00093365]]. This system provides immunity against bacteriophage, it allows phage adsorption but blocks phage DNA replication. PglZ is predicted to have a phosphatase activity and is described as probable antitoxin component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, that inhibits the toxic activity of its cognate toxin PglX [[cite:PUB00105105]]. PglZ is one of the four genes (pglW, pglX, pglY, and pglZ) that were shown to be necessary and sufficient for the Pgl phenotype [[cite:PUB00151239]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033446" "BREX-2 system phosphatase PglZ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "BREX system phosphatase PglZ", "short" "BREX_PglZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 271, "taxa" 1161, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 760, "sets" 0, "proteins" 760, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 550}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047992", :literature {"PUB00151239" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Sumby P" "Smith MC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02896.x", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Genetics of the phage growth limitation (Pgl) system of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "489-500", "volume" "44", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11972785}, "PUB00105105" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hoskisson PA" "Sumby P" "Smith MCM."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "The phage growth limitation system in Streptomyces coelicolor A(3)2 is a toxin/antitoxin system, comprising enzymes with DNA methyltransferase, protein kinase and ATPase activity.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "100-109", "volume" "477", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25592393}, "PUB00093365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Goldfarb T" "Sberro H" "Weinstock E" "Cohen O" "Doron S" "Charpak-Amikam Y" "Afik S" "Ofir G" "Sorek R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "BREX is a novel phage resistance system widespread in microbial genomes.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "169-83", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25452498}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047992", "name" "BREX system phosphatase PglZ", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
