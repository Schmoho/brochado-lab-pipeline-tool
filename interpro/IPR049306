{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including GLV1 and GLV2 (also known as RGF9) from Arabidopsis. GLV2 is a signalling peptide (root growth factor) that regulates the pattern of root growth and lateral root development by modulating the length and the number of cortical cells in the root apical meristem (RAM), and the anticlinal asymmetric cell divisions in lateral root initiation cells [[cite:PUB00096624], [cite:PUB00096623]]. It is also involved in the regulation of hypocotyl bending and root gravitropism, probably by influencing the formation of auxin gradients [[cite:PUB00096625]]. In general, RGFs are required for maintenance of the root stem cell niche and transit amplifying cell proliferation in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00088438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21529" "Gloven 1/2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Golven 1/2-like", "short" "GLV1-2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 220, "taxa" 830, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1006, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1006, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 604}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049306", :literature {"PUB00088438" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5995", "authors" ["Matsuzaki Y" "Ogawa-Ohnishi M" "Mori A" "Matsubayashi Y."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1191132", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Secreted peptide signals required for maintenance of root stem cell niche in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1065-7", "volume" "329", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20798316}, "PUB00096623" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Fernandez A" "Drozdzecki A" "Hoogewijs K" "Nguyen A" "Beeckman T" "Madder A" "Hilson P."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Transcriptional and functional classification of the GOLVEN/ROOT GROWTH FACTOR/CLE-like signaling peptides reveals their role in lateral root and hair formation.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "954-70", "volume" "161", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23370719}, "PUB00096624" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Meng L" "Buchanan BB" "Feldman LJ" "Luan S."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "CLE-like (CLEL) peptides control the pattern of root growth and lateral root development in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1760-5", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22307643}, "PUB00096625" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Whitford R" "Fernandez A" "Tejos R" "Perez AC" "Kleine-Vehn J" "Vanneste S" "Drozdzecki A" "Leitner J" "Abas L" "Aerts M" "Hoogewijs K" "Baster P" "De Groodt R" "Lin YC" "Storme V" "Van de Peer Y" "Beeckman T" "Madder A" "Devreese B" "Luschnig C" "Friml J" "Hilson P."], "ISO_journal" "Dev Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Dev Cell", "title" "GOLVEN secretory peptides regulate auxin carrier turnover during plant gravitropic responses.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "678-85", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22421050}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049306", "name" "Golven 1/2-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 31, "alignment:full" 581}}}
