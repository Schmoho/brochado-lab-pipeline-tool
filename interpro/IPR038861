{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a group of homeobox proteins, including ADNP and ADNP2 [[cite:PUB00088709]]. ADNP regulates the expression of >400 genes during embryonic development, vital for mammalian brain formation [[cite:PUB00088709], [cite:PUB00088501]]. It has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and has been shown to play an important roles in autophagy. ADNP has also been associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [[cite:PUB00088501]]. ADNP de novo mutations in humans result in a syndromic form of autism-like spectrum disorder (ASD), including cognitive and motor deficits, the ADNP syndrome (Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa) [[cite:PUB00088501]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15740" "NEUROPROTECTIVE PEPTIDE-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox protein", "short" "ADNP/ADNP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 643, "taxa" 3113, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2711, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2711, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1986}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038861", :literature {"PUB00088501" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Sragovich S" "Merenlender-Wagner A" "Gozes I."], "ISO_journal" "Bioessays", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700054", "medline_journal" "Bioessays", "title" "ADNP Plays a Key Role in Autophagy: From Autism to Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28940660}, "PUB00088709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kushnir M" "Dresner E" "Mandel S" "Gozes I."], "ISO_journal" "J.
