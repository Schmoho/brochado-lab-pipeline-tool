{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The biosynthesis of avilamycin, an oligosaccharide antibiotic, starts with the formation of a disaccharide synthesised from D-glucose. AviX12 is involved in C-2 epimerization of the glucose moiety after the whole avilamycin molecule has been formed to form the d-mannose stereoisomer. Unusually, the C-2 carbon is an uncativated centre, and it is thought that AviX12 generates the 5'deoxyadenosyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom a position C-2 of the mannose moiety to form a radical intermediate. This intermediate undergoes epimerization by an unknown mechanism [[cite:PUB00081924]].</p>\r\n<reaction>avilamycin A precursor + S-adenosyl-L-methionine zwitterion ->avilamycin A+5'-deoxyadenosine + L-methionine zwitterion</reaction>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This family includes avilamycin epimerase AviX12 and related proteins from Actinobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00421" "avilamycin epimerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Avilamycin epimerase", "short" "Avilamycin_epimerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 26, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033971", :literature {"PUB00081924" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Boll R" "Hofmann C" "Heitmann B" "Hauser G" "Glaser S" "Koslowski T" "Friedrich T" "Bechthold A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
