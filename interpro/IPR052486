{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PHO1 is characterised by its role in inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and homeostasis in plants. It is involved in various aspects of Pi handling, including sensing Pi starvation [[cite:PUB00155264]], exporting Pi out of cells [[cite:PUB00132161], [cite:PUB00155263]], and transferring Pi between different plant tissues such as roots and shoots [[cite:PUB00155261], [cite:PUB00155262]]. It contains an SPX domain that binds inositol polyphosphate signaling molecules, which may be involved in sensing Pi levels, and an EXS domain essential for Pi efflux and proper cellular localisation. PHO1 contributes to the regulation of Pi starvation responses and may interact with transcription factors through its SPX domain [[cite:PUB00155264]]. Overall, PHO1 plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate balance within the plant, which is vital for various physiological processes including growth and stress responses.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48477" "PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER PHO1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphate transporter PHO1", "short" "PHO1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 235, "taxa" 919, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1706, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1706, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 979}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052486", :literature {"PUB00155264" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6288", "authors" ["Wild R" "Gerasimaite R" "Jung JY" "Truffault V" "Pavlovic I" "Schmidt A" "Saiardi A" "Jessen HJ" "Poirier Y" "Hothorn M" "Mayer A."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad9858", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Control of eukaryotic phosphate homeostasis by inositol polyphosphate sensor domains.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "986-90", "volume" "352", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27080106}, "PUB00155261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Hamburger D" "Rezzonico E" "MacDonald-Comber Petetot J" "Somerville C" "Poirier Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.000745", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "Identification and characterization of the Arabidopsis PHO1 gene involved in phosphate loading to the xylem.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "889-902", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11971143}, "PUB00155262" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Stefanovic A" "Ribot C" "Rouached H" "Wang Y" "Chong J" "Belbahri L" "Delessert S" "Poirier Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03108.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Members of the PHO1 gene family show limited functional redundancy in phosphate transfer to the shoot, and are regulated by phosphate deficiency via distinct pathways.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "982-94", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17461783}, "PUB00132161" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Stefanovic A" "Arpat AB" "Bligny R" "Gout E" "Vidoudez C" "Bensimon M" "Poirier Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Over-expression of PHO1 in Arabidopsis leaves reveals its role in mediating phosphate efflux.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "689-99", "volume" "66", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21309867}, "PUB00155263" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Arpat AB" "Magliano P" "Wege S" "Rouached H" "Stefanovic A" "Poirier Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05004.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Functional expression of PHO1 to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network and its role in export of inorganic phosphate.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "479-91", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22449068}, "PUB00082650" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zimmerli C" "Ribot C" "Vavasseur A" "Bauer H" "Hedrich R" "Poirier Y."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05058.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "PHO1 expression in guard cells mediates the stomatal response to abscisic acid in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "199-211", "volume" "72", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22612335}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016036", "name" "cellular response to phosphate starvation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR052486", "name" "Phosphate transporter PHO1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
