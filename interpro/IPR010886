{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family that includes Histone H1-like protein HC1 from Chlamydia pneumoniae and similar proteins from bacteria and some archaeal species. The gene coding for HC1 is expressed only during the late stages of the chlamydial life cycle concomitant with the reorganisation of chlamydial reticulate bodies into elementary bodies, suggesting that the HC1 protein plays a role in the condensation of chlamydial chromatin during intracellular differentiation, in a role analogous to that of eukaryotic histone proteins [[cite:PUB00013148]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07432" "Histone H1-like protein Hc1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone H1-like Hc1", "short" "Hc1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 521, "taxa" 2512, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3473, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3473, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2762}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010886", :literature {"PUB00013148" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hackstadt T" "Baehr W" "Ying Y."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
