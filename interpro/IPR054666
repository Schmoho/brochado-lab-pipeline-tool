{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are radical SAM/SPASM enzymes that modify RiPP precursor peptides to introduce sulfur-to-alpha-carbon amino acid side chain crosslinks. Peptides modified in this way are often called sactipeptides, therefore, this family of proteins has been called radical SAM/SPASM domain sactipeptide maturase StsB based on the protein from Streptomyces sparsogenes. The enzyme crosslinks Cys residues to Gly residues in antiparallel peptide chain motifs of CxCxC to GxGxG in StsA, and CxC to GxG in related peptides [[cite:PUB00154685]]. StsB shares higher full-length similarity with MftC (mycofactocin biosynthesis) than any other characterised enzyme. However, a comparative analysis of StsB to known rSAM proteins predicted that StsB would be distinct from MftC and instead form sactionine bonds [[cite:PUB00154685]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045574" "StsB family radical SAM/SPASM domain sactipeptide maturase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sactipeptide maturase StsB", "short" "Sacti_mat_StsB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 26, "taxa" 82, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054666", :literature {"PUB00154685" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Precord TW" "Ramesh S" "Dommaraju SR" "Harris LA" "Kille BL" "Mitchell DA."], "ISO_journal" "ACS Bio Med Chem Au", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsbiomedchemau.2c00085", "medline_journal" "ACS Bio Med Chem Au", "title" "Catalytic Site Proximity Profiling for Functional Unification of Sequence-Diverse Radical <i>S</i>-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "240-251", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 37363077}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR050377", "name" "Radical SAM PqqA peptide cyclase/Mycofactocin maturase MftC-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR054666", "name" "Sactipeptide maturase StsB", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
