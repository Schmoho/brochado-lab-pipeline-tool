Another crucial player is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdINS(3)P), which is enriched on early endosomes and on the luminal vesicles of MVBs. ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-I, -II and -III complexes are critical for MVB budding and sorting of monoubiquitinated cargo into the luminal vesicles [[cite:PUB00087727]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF017215" "ESCRT-2 complex, Vps22p/Eap30 subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR12806" "EAP30 SUBUNIT OF ELL COMPLEX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ESCRT-2 complex, Snf8", "short" "ESCRT-2_cplx_Snf8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2457, "taxa" 8595, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4309, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4284, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2852}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016689", :literature {"PUB00087727" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Williams RL" "Urbe S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
