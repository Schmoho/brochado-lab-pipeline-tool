{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In the Actinobacteria, as shown for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, some proteins are modified by ligation between an Îµ-amino group of a lysine side chain and the C-terminal carboxylate of the ubiquitin-like protein Pup. This modification leads to protein degradation by the archaeal-like proteasome found in the Actinobacteria. Members of this protein family belong to the AAA family of ATPases and tend to be clustered with the genes for Pup, the Pup ligase PafA, and structural components of the proteasome. This protein forms hexameric rings with ATPase activity.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03689" "proteasome ATPase"}, "hamap" {"MF_02112" "Proteasome-associated ATPase [mpa]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteasome ATPase", "short" "Proteasome_ATPase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1642, "taxa" 4815, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4983, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4983, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3875}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0833", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0833"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022482", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016887", "name" "ATP hydrolysis activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0010498", "name" "proteasomal protein catabolic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019941", "name" "modification-dependent protein catabolic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000502", "name" "proteasome complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022482", "name" "Proteasome ATPase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
