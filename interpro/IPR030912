{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Sec-independent protein export system TAT, or twin-arginine translocation, is composed of TatA, TatB, and TatC. The TAT system is unusual in Leptospira, with Lys replacing Arg in the second position of the twin-Arg motif. This protein, restricted to Leptospira and showing distant homology to the phosphoserine phosphatases RsbU and SpoIIE, is always encoded immediately downstream of the tatC gene and appears to be part of the variant TAT system. It lacks a TAT signal itself, and so is more likely to be part of the Sec-independent translocation machinery than to be a substrate [[cite:PUB00105015]]. The suggested symbol is rktP, for RK-Translocation Phosphatase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04400" "Arg-Lys translocation region protein phosphatase RktP"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arg-Lys translocation region protein phosphatase RktP", "short" "RK_trnsloc_Pase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 158, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 119, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 107}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030912", :literature {"PUB00105015" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Fouts DE" "Matthias MA" "Adhikarla H" "Adler B" "Amorim-Santos L" "Berg DE" "Bulach D" "Buschiazzo A" "Chang YF" "Galloway RL" "Haake DA" "Haft DH" "Hartskeerl R" "Ko AI" "Levett PN" "Matsunaga J" "Mechaly AE" "Monk JM" "Nascimento AL" "Nelson KE" "Palsson B" "Peacock SJ" "Picardeau M" "Ricaldi JN" "Thaipandungpanit J" "Wunder EA Jr" "Yang XF" "Zhang JJ" "Vinetz JM."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Negl Trop Dis", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Negl Trop Dis", "title" "What Makes a Bacterial Species Pathogenic?:Comparative Genomic Analysis of the Genus Leptospira.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0004403", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26890609}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030912", "name" "Arg-Lys translocation region protein phosphatase RktP", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
