{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of enzymes is responsible for the creation of a glycyl radical in the ground state of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase. This enzyme is unique amongst the glycyl radical enzymes in having a small subunit and being a functional hetero-octamer (made up of four large subunits and four small subunits) in the biologically active state [[cite:PUB00057106], [cite:PUB00083546]]. The small subunit is responsible for metal binding and is also involved in the regulation of the enzymes' oligomeric state and activity, which are triggered by reversible serine phosphorylation of the glycyl radical subunits [[cite:PUB00016705]].  These enzymes differ from their PFL-AE and Nrd counterparts in that they contain up to two iron-sulfur centres, in addition to the characteristic SAM cluster, these extra clusters are thought to be involved in the electron transfer to the SAM cluster but do not directly participate in the reductive cleavage of SAM [[cite:PUB00083547], [cite:PUB00083548], [cite:PUB00083549]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00279" "4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase activase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "4-Hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase activase", "short" "4-hPhe_decarboxylase_activase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
