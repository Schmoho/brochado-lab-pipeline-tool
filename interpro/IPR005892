{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the ATP binding subunit of a subfamily of ABC transporters, including ProV (for glycine betaine and proline betaine transport, [[cite:PUB00106869]]), OpuBA (choline, [[cite:PUB00009832]]), OpuCA (carnitine, [[cite:PUB00019966]]), GbuA (glycine betaine and carnitine, [[cite:PUB00106868]]) and OusV (glycine betaine and choline, [[cite:PUB00086656]]). This transport system belong to the larger ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. The characteristic feature of these transporter is the obligatory coupling of ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation.</p>\n\n<p>The minimal configuration of bacterial ABC transport system includes an ATP binding (and hydrolysing) subunit; a hydrophilic polypeptide that forms a channel through the membrane, and a substrate binding protein; any of these subunits may be represented by two paralogs instead of just one. Substrates for many members of this transport system, such as glycine betaine (a glycine with its N trimethylated, often simply called betaine), serve as osmoprotectants , although they also may serve as nutrients. Members of the family are the ATP-binding subunit of ABC transporters for substrates such as betaine, L-proline or other amino acids, choline, carnitine, etc. The substrate specificity is best determined from the substrate-binding subunit, rather than this subunit, as it interacts with the permease subunit and not with substrate directly.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01186" "betaine/proline/choline family ABC transporter ATP-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycine betaine/proline betaine transport system ATP-binding protein ProV-like", "short" "Gly-betaine_transp_ATP-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3579, "taxa" 14290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22373, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17297}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1126", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1126"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
