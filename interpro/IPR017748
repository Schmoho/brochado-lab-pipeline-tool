{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the T6S-associated protein, TagF, a post-translational repressor of the hemolysin co-regulated secretion island I (HSI-I)-encoded type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS), found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is found broadly among the Proteobacteria and is implicated in diverse processes including host-cell interactions, biofilm formation and gene regulation. Furthermore, studies indicate that the T6SS plays a critical role in interbacterial interactions. TagF has been shown to regulate the activity of the H1-T6SS in a manner that does not require phosphorylated-Fha1, PpkA, or other Tag proteins. TagF forms a homodimer with nearly identical monomers composed of alpha and beta elements assembled as a three-layer sandwich (α-β-α) [[cite:PUB00086563]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038225", "name" "T6S-associated protein TagF superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09867" "TagF N-terminal domain, Type VI secretion system-associated"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03373" "type VI secretion system-associated protein TagF"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029287" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP029287 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T6S-associated protein TagF", "short" "TagF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 751, "taxa" 4348, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4837, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4799, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3804}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0735", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0735"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017748", :literature {"PUB00086563" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Silverman JM" "Austin LS" "Hsu F" "Hicks KG" "Hood RD" "Mougous JD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
