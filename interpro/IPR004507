{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In Escherichia coli, the protein UbiX ([ec:2.5.1.129]) is a flavin prenyltransferase that has been shown to be involved in the third step of ubiquinone biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00076706]]. It is required for the reaction 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate = 2-octaprenylphenol + CO2 ([ec:4.1.1.98]) catalyzed by UbiD and was initially believed to directly catalyse this reaction [[cite:PUB00068237]]. The knockout of the homologous protein in yeast (Pad1) confers sensitivity to phenylacrylic acid, showing that this enzyme functions as a phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase [[cite:PUB00009520], [cite:PUB00068238]].</p>\n\n<p>E. coli strains also contain, in addition to UbiX, a second paralogue named Pad1. Its amino acid sequence shows 52% identity to UbiX and slightly higher sequence identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase Pad1. Despite its higher sequence similarity with yeast Pad1, E. coli Pad1 does not seem to have phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase activity. Its function is unknown, Pad1 may remove the carboxylate group from derivatives of benzoic acid but not from substituted phenolic acids [[cite:PUB00037596]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes flavin prenyltransferase LpdB from Lactobacillus [[cite:PUB00088723]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6m8t", "name" "Crystal structure of UbiX-like FMN prenyltransferase AF1214 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, FMN complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036551", "name" "Flavin prenyltransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00421" "UbiX family flavin prenyltransferase"}, "panther" {"PTHR43374" "FLAVIN PRENYLTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01984" "Flavin prenyltransferase UbiX [ubiX]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flavin prenyltransferase UbiX-like", "short" "UbiX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4794, "taxa" 20095, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24743, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24734, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18603}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0136", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0136"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
