{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fatty acid desaturases are enzymes that catalyse the insertion of a double bond at the delta position of fatty acids. There seems to be two distinct families of fatty acid desaturases which do not seem to be evolutionary related: the first contains stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), also known as Acyl-CoA desaturase or delta-9 desaturase ([ec:1.14.19.1]); the second includes plant stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein and cyanobacteria desA protein [[cite:PUB00096672], [cite:PUB00096673]].</p>\n\n<p>SCD is a key regulatory enzyme of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. In association with cytochrome b5 and NADP-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase, it constitutes part of a microsomal membrane-bound 3-component system in animals and fungi [[cite:PUB00002472]]. SCD contains 4 putative transmembrane (TM) regions that anchor it in the microsomal membrane [[cite:PUB00096671]]. SCD uses oxygen and electrons from reduced cytochrome b5 [[cite:PUB00002590], [cite:PUB00002424], [cite:PUB00096670]] to catalyse the insertion of a cis double bond between carbons 9 and 10 of a spectrum of fatty acids [[cite:PUB00002472], [cite:PUB00002590], [cite:PUB00002424]]. The preferred substrates of SCD are palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA, which are converted to palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) acids respectively [[cite:PUB00002472], [cite:PUB00002424], [cite:PUB00096670]]. These unsaturated molecules are the major storage form of fatty acids (as triacylglycerols) in adipocytes [[cite:PUB00002472]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03505" "Delta9-FADS-like"}, "prints" {"PR00075" "FACDDSATRASE"}, "panther" {"PTHR11351" "ACYL-COA DESATURASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acyl-CoA desaturase", "short" "Acyl-CoA_DS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5635, "taxa" 21672, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 32646, "sets" 0, "proteins" 32244, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22839}, "pathways" 75}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
