{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and related prokaryotic. These proteins show considerable similarity and identical active site residues to FabH, the beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III of bacteria and plants. They catalyze the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). These enzymes function in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway leading to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), a key precursor for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds that are building blocks of archaeal membrane lipids. In Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Methanococcus jannaschii) [swissprot:Q58941], Cys-112 is the site of acyl group attachment and His-234 and Asn-237 are also active site residues by homology to FabH.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016039", "name" "Thiolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01409" "UPF0219 protein <locus_tag>"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00748" "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase", "short" "HMG_CoA_Synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 180, "taxa" 1880, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2281, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2281, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1806}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0047", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0047"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
