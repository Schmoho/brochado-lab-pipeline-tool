Upon agonist-dependent activation, PLC catalyses the hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), generating the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds specific intracellular receptors to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup>mobilisation, while DAG mediates activation of a family of protein kinase C isozymes. This catalytic process is tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation and binding of regulatory proteins [[cite:PUB00024211], [cite:PUB00002715], [cite:PUB00005394]]. Based on molecular size, immunoreactivity and amino acid sequence, several subtypes have been classified. Overall, sequence identity between sub-types is low, yet all isoforms share a split TIM barrel containing two conserved domains, designated X and Y [[cite:PUB00072646]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7z3j", "name" "Structure of crystallisable rat Phospholipase C gamma 1 in complex with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00390" "PHPHLIPASEC"}, "panther" {"PTHR10336" "PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-SPECIFIC PHOSPHOLIPASE C FAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoinositide phospholipase C family", "short" "PI-PLC_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2592, "taxa" 9068, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43209, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38351, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20279}, "pathways" 163}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
