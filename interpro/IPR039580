{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcriptional and immune response regulator (Tcim; also known as C8orf4 or TC1) is a regulator implicated in cancer and inflammation [[cite:PUB00089837]].

It plays a role in the mitogen-activated MAPK2/3 signaling pathway, and positively regulates G1-to-S-phase transition of the cell cycle [[cite:PUB00089838]]. It negatively regulates the self-renewal of liver cancer stem cells via suppression of NOTCH2 signalling [[cite:PUB00076422]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32358" "TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND IMMUNE RESPONSE REGULATOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional and immune response regulator", "short" "Tcim"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 602, "taxa" 2052, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 749, "sets" 0, "proteins" 749, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 556}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039580", :literature {"PUB00089837" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Kim J" "Kim Y" "Kim HT" "Kim DW" "Ha Y" "Kim J" "Kim CH" "Lee I" "Song K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
