This molecule is produced by the adenylate cyclase (AC) enzyme, using ATP as its substrate. Mammalian adenylate cyclase has nine closely related membrane-bound isoforms (AC1-9) showing significant sequence homology and sharing the same overall structure: two hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and two cytoplasmic domains that are responsible for the catalytic activity. These isoforms differ in both their tissue specificity and their regulation. Regulatory factors known to influence one or more of these isoforms include G proteins, protein kinases, calcium and calmodulin [[cite:PUB00034664], [cite:PUB00034665]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF039050" "Adenylate cyclase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylate cyclase", "short" "Adcy"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 794, "taxa" 3226, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11758, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9027, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4878}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2093", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2093"} {"accession" "GenProp2092", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2092"} {"accession" "GenProp2094", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2094"} {"accession" "GenProp2089", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2089"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
