{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains two related enzymes:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Aspartate carbamoyltransferase ([ec:2.1.3.2]) (ATCase) catalyses the conversion of aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to carbamoylaspartate, the second step in the<i>de novo</i>biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides [[cite:PUB00002421]]. In prokaryotes ATCase consists of two subunits: a catalytic chain (gene pyrB) and a regulatory chain (gene pyrI), while in eukaryotes it is a domain in a multi-functional enzyme (called URA2 in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila, and CAD in mammals [[cite:PUB00000720]]) that also catalyses other steps of the biosynthesis of pyrimidines [[cite:PUB00074256]].</li>\n<li>Ornithine carbamoyltransferase ([ec:2.1.3.3]) (OTCase) catalyses the conversion of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline. In mammals, this enzyme participates in the urea cycle [[cite:PUB00000710]] and is located in the mitochondrial matrix. In prokaryotes and eukaryotic microorganisms it is involved in the biosynthesis of arginine. In some bacterial species it is also involved in the degradation of arginine [[cite:PUB00001352]] (the arginine deaminase pathway).</li></ol>\n\n<p>It has been shown [[cite:PUB00004607]] that these two enzymes are evolutionary related. The predicted secondary structure of both enzymes are similar and there are some regions of sequence similarities. One of these regions includes three residues which have been shown, by crystallographic studies [[cite:PUB00004604]], to be implicated in binding the phosphoryl group of carbamoyl phosphate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036901", "name" "Aspartate/ornithine carbamoyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00097" "Aspartate and ornithine carbamoyltransferases signature"}, "prints" {"PR00100" "AOTCASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartate/ornithine carbamoyltransferase", "short" "Asp/Orn_carbamoylTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 190, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11944, "taxa" 46193, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 381589, "sets" 0, "proteins" 100903, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 74685}, "pathways" 32}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00091", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00091"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
