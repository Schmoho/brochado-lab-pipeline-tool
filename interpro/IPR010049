{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the enzyme 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTA/SAH nucleosidase) ([ec:3.2.2.9]) which acts on its two substrates at the same active site.  This enzyme is involved in the recycling of the components of S-adenosylmethionine after it has donated one of its two non-ribose sulphur ligands to an acceptor.  In the case of 5'-methylthioadenosine this represents the first step of the methionine salvage pathway in bacteria [[cite:PUB00013756], [cite:PUB00013829]]. This enzyme is essential for bacterial metabolism, while is absent in mammals, showing potential for antibiotic design [[cite:PUB00050679], [cite:PUB00099944]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3bl6", "name" "Crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase in complex with formycin A"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035994", "name" "Nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01684" "5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase [mtnN]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01704" "5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MTA/SAH nucleosidase", "short" "MTA_SAH_Nsdase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 68, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3082, "taxa" 13000, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13827, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13821, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10590}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1482", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1482"} {"accession" "GenProp0730", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0730"} {"accession" "GenProp0757", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0757"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
