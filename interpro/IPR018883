{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Delta carbonic anhydrases are one of the at least five independently evolved families of carbonic anhydrases. Their activities, low CO2-induction, and localizations have been well studied in diatoms [[cite:PUB00098619], [cite:PUB00098618]]. The catalytic mechanism of delta CAs is currently unknown. Proteins of this family are also common in bacteria, but due to more distant relationship (identities less than 30% to the diatom delta CAs) and to the lack of experimental data the carbonic anhydrase activity is only putative in prokaryotic delta CAs.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10563" "Delta carbonic anhydrase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Delta carbonic anhydrase", "short" "Delta_CA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 192, "taxa" 1165, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 860, "sets" 0, "proteins" 835, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 654}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018883", :literature {"PUB00098618" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2-3", "authors" ["Samukawa M" "Shen C" "Hopkinson BM" "Matsuda Y."], "ISO_journal" "Photosynth Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Photosynth Res", "title" "Localization of putative carbonic anhydrases in the marine diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "235-49", "volume" "121", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24414291}, "PUB00098619" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lee RB" "Smith JA" "Rickaby RE."], "ISO_journal" "J Phycol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Phycol", "title" "Cloning, Expression and Characterization of the Î´-carbonic Anhydrase of Thalassiosira weissflogii (Bacillariophyceae).", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "170-7", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27008398}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018883", "name" "Delta carbonic anhydrase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 33, "alignment:full" 267}}}
