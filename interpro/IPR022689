In Corynebacterium diphtheriae where it has been studied in some detail this protein acts as an iron-binding repressor of diphtheria toxin gene expression and may serve as a global regulator of gene expression. DTXR comprises an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, an interface domain (which contains two metal-binding sites) and a third, very flexible C-terminal domain. The second domain is responsible for dimerization and metal binding. The N terminus may be involved in iron binding and may associate with the Tox operator. Binding of DTXR to Tox operator requires a divalent metal ion such as cobalt, ferric, manganese and nickel whereas zinc shows weak activation [[cite:PUB00005267]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4hx4", "name" "Structure of MNTR mutant E11K complexed with Mn2+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036421", "name" "Iron dependent repressor, metal binding and dimerisation domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM00529" "Helix-turn-helix diphteria tox regulatory element"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Iron dependent repressor", "short" "Iron_dep_repressor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 69, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5720, "taxa" 22101, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36010, "sets" 0, "proteins" 36007, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27875}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022689", :literature {"PUB00005267" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Qiu X" "Verlinde CL" "Zhang S" "Schmitt MP" "Holmes RK" "Hol WG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00137-X", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Three-dimensional structure of the diphtheria toxin repressor in complex with divalent cation co-repressors.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "87-100", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7743135}, "PUB00004874" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Schiering N" "Tao X" "Zeng H" "Murphy JR" "Petsko GA" "Ringe D."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
