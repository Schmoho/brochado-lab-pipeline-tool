{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The light-harvesting complex (LHC) consists of chlorophylls A and B and the chlorophyll A-B binding protein. LHC functions as a light receptor that captures and delivers excitation energy to photosystems I and II with which it is closely associated. Under changing light conditions, the reversible phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCII) represents a system for balancing the excitation energy between the two photosystems [[cite:PUB00015383]].</p>\r\n<p>The N terminus of the chlorophyll A-B binding protein extends into the stroma where it is involved with adhesion of granal membranes and photo-regulated by reversible phosphorylation of its threonine residues [[cite:PUB00015384]]. Both these processes are believed to mediate the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems I and II.</p>\r\n<p>This family also includes the photosystem II protein PsbS, which plays a role in energy-dependent quenching that increases thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the photosystem [[cite:PUB00015385]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6a2w", "name" "Crystal structure of fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c complex from Phaeodactylum tricornutum"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00504" "Chlorophyll A-B binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chlorophyll A-B binding protein", "short" "Chloroa_b-bind"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 145, "domain_architectures" 329, "proteomes" 567, "taxa" 3909, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25805, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23472, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15516}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022796", :literature {"PUB00015383" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-3", "authors" ["Liu XD" "Shen YG."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2004.05.065", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "NaCl-induced phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins in thylakoid membranes from the halotolerant green alga, Dunaliella salina.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "337-40", "volume" "569", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15225658}, "PUB00015385" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Li XP" "Gilmore AM" "Caffarri S" "Bassi R" "Golan T" "Kramer D" "Niyogi KK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
