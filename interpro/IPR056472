{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Head completion protein (HCP) found in T5-like bacteriophages [[cite:PUB00096391]]. HCP forms dodecameric ring assembly and is a component of the bacteriophage neck. It holds the portal protein PrtP dodecameric ring and connects with the trimeric layer of the tail tube via contacts with the tail completion (TCP) hexameric ring [[cite:PUB00155646]]. HCP makes contacts with DNA. HCP consists of two domains. The first domain folds into an α-helical bundle composed of N- and C-terminal helices whereas the second domain adopts a β-sandwich [[cite:PUB00155646]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24163" "Head completion protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Head completion protein", "short" "HCP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 663, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 392, "sets" 0, "proteins" 392, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056472", :literature {"PUB00155646" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ayala R" "Moiseenko AV" "Chen TH" "Kulikov EE" "Golomidova AK" "Orekhov PS" "Street MA" "Sokolova OS" "Letarov AV" "Wolf M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43824-9", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Nearly complete structure of bacteriophage DT57C reveals architecture of head-to-tail interface and lateral tail fibers.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "8205", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38081816}, "PUB00096391" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zivanovic Y" "Confalonieri F" "Ponchon L" "Lurz R" "Chami M" "Flayhan A" "Renouard M" "Huet A" "Decottignies P" "Davidson AR" "Breyton C" "Boulanger P."], "ISO_journal" "J Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Virol", "title" "Insights into bacteriophage T5 structure from analysis of its morphogenesis genes and protein components.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "1162-74", "volume" "88", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24198424}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056472", "name" "Head completion protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 60}}}
