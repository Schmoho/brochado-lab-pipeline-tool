{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are found in a variety of bacteria, and are ATPases that occurs as a cytoplasmic component of the type III secretion system (T3SS) found in many pathogenic bacteria. This entry includes SctN (also known as YscN) from Yersinia enterocolitica, which is a component of the Yop (Yersinia outer protein) secretion machinery that acts as a molecular motor to provide the energy that is required for the export of proteins [[cite:PUB00097932]]. It may be required for type III secretion apparatus formation, proper protein secretion, host cell invasion and virulence [[cite:PUB00034695]]. This protein is required for the stabilization of the major sorting platform component (or C-ring component) [[cite:PUB00097931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02546" "type III secretion system ATPase SctN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type 3 secretion system ATPase SctN", "short" "ATPase_T3SS_SctN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 353, "taxa" 2455, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2356, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2356, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1938}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
