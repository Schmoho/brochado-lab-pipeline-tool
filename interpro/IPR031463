{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mic12, also known as Aim5, is a subunit of the MICOS complex, a mitochondrial inner membrane complex that functions as a primary determinant of mitochondrial inner membrane structure [[cite:PUB00075871]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeast MICOS complex is comprised of six core subunits: Mic60, Mic10, Mic19, Mic27, Mic26, and Mic12. The MICOS complex can be divided into two independent subcomplexes: Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 and Mic60/Mic19 according to their dependence of respiratory complexes and the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin. The dependence of the Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 subcomplex on respiratory complexes suggests that in addition to the roles in cristae biogenesis, this subcomplex coordinates with respiratory complexes and lipids to establish mitochondrial inner membrane architecture [[cite:PUB00075871]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17050" "Altered inheritance of mitochondria 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MICOS complex subunit Mic12", "short" "Mic12"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 811, "taxa" 2191, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1177, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 766}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031463", :literature {"PUB00075871" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Friedman JR" "Mourier A" "Yamada J" "McCaffery JM" "Nunnari J."], "ISO_journal" "Elife", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07739", "medline_journal" "Elife", "title" "MICOS coordinates with respiratory complexes and lipids to establish mitochondrial inner membrane architecture.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25918844}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042407", "name" "cristae formation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0044284", "name" "mitochondrial crista junction", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}} {"identifier" "GO:0061617", "name" "MICOS complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031463", "name" "MICOS complex subunit Mic12", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 94, "alignment:full" 601}}}
