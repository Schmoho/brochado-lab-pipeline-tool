{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ganglioside GM2 synthase (N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, GalNAcT) is one of the key enzymes in gangliosides biosynthesis, which involves a series of ER- or Golgi-based glycosyltransferases. GalNAcT is a type II integral membrane protein of the Golgi apparatus that catalyses the synthesis of the glycosphingolipids GM2, GD2, and GA2. GalNAcT and galactosyltransferase II form a Golgi-localised enzyme complex that is stabilised by non-covalent association. This enzyme association has been suggested to facilitate the biosynthesis sequence from GM3/GD3 to GM1/GD1b via GM2/GD2 as intermediates [[cite:PUB00014811]]. Complex gangliosides are required for the maintenance of axons and myelin [[cite:PUB00014812]].</p>\r\n<p>Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CT-GalNAcT) shares 51% sequence identity with GalNAcT, showing the strongest conservation in the catalytic domains. CT-GalNAcT is a type II Golgi transmembrane protein characteristic of other mammalian glycosyltransferases. It functions in the synthesis of murine T-lymphocyte CT antigen [[cite:PUB00014813]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000474" "(N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosylglucosylceramide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ganglioside GM2 synthase", "short" "GM2_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 275, "taxa" 1180, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1004, "sets" 0, "proteins" 943, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 568}, "pathways" 207}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
