{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of thiopurine S-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.67]), thiol S-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.9]) and thiocyanate methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.n4]).</p>\n\n<p>Thiopurine S-methyltransferase is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyses S-methylation of aromatic and heterocyclic sulphydryl compounds, including anticancer and immunosuppressive thiopurines [[cite:PUB00011488]]. Thiopurine is commonly used to suppress the immune system in the case of autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease and to prevent transplanted organ rejection [[cite:PUB00043377]]. Thiopurine drugs can be toxic to cells but their effect can be mediated by the incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides into DNA [[cite:PUB00043378]].</p>\n\n<p>Thiocyanate methyltransferase and thiol S-methyltransferase are involved in glucosinolate metabolism and defense against phytopathogens. Thiocyanate methyltransferase is highly reactive to thiocyanate (NCS-) derived from myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates upon tissue damage [[cite:PUB00058161]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6mro", "name" "Crystal structure of methyl transferase from Methanosarcina acetivorans at 1.6 Angstroms resolution, Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (NESG) Target MvR53."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51585" "Thiopurine or thiol or thiocyanate S-methyltransferase (TPMT) family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF05724" "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TPMT family", "short" "TPMT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 106, "proteomes" 3804, "taxa" 15085, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14051, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13997, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10147}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
