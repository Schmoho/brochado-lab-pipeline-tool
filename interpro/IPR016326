{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a mating factor alpha from Saccharomycetales (budding yeasts) [[cite:PUB00019855]]. The alpha-factor is produced by the haploid cells of the alpha mating type, and acts on cells of the opposite mating type (type a). The alpha-pheromone reversibly arrests the growth of these cells in the early G1 period of the cell cycle, which has been suggested to be a method of synchronisation of the two haploid cell cycles prior to mating.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001866" "Mating factor alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mating factor alpha", "short" "Mating_factor_a"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 130, "sets" 0, "proteins" 121, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 99}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016326", :literature {"PUB00019855" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Singh A" "Chen EY" "Lugovoy JM" "Chang CN" "Hitzeman RA" "Seeburg PH."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/11.12.4049", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two discrete genes coding for the alpha-factor pheromone.", "year" 1983, "raw_pages" "4049-63", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6306574}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000772", "name" "mating pheromone activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000750", "name" "pheromone-dependent signal transduction involved in conjugation with cellular fusion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005576", "name" "extracellular region", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR016326", "name" "Mating factor alpha", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
