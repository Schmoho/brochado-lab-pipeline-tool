{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains serine peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family S68 (PIDD auto-processing protein, clan S-). These proteins are known as Pidd (short for p53-induced protein with a death domain) proteins [[cite:PUB00063585]]. Pidd forms a complex with Raidd and procaspase-2 that is known as the 'Piddosome'. The Piddosome forms when DNA damage occurs and either activates NF-kappaB, leading to cell survival, or caspase-2, which leads to apoptosis [[cite:PUB00063586], [cite:PUB00033426]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10461" "Peptidase S68"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S68, pidd", "short" "Peptidase_S68_pidd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 579, "taxa" 1972, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 884, "sets" 0, "proteins" 884, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 623}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
