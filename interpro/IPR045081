{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ANP32 family members of phosphoproteins are composed of a N-terminal evolutionarily conserved leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a C-terminal variable anionic region. They are multifunctional proteins involved in the regulation of many processes including tumor suppression, apoptosis, cell cycle progression or transcription [[cite:PUB00098000], [cite:PUB00098001], [cite:PUB00043547], [cite:PUB00098002]]. ANP32A is one of the components of the INHAT (INHibitor of AcetylTransferases) complex, which contains the histone chaperone TAF-I (template-activating factor-I), directly binds the core histones, and inhibits the acetylation of the core histones H3 and H4. ANP32B has been shown to interact with the core histones H3-H4 through its acidic concave domain [[cite:PUB00097998]]. ANP32E is an H2A.Z chaperone able specifically to remove H2A.Z from the nucleosome [[cite:PUB00088027]]. It has been shown that ANP32A is an essential host partner coopted to support influenza virus vRNP polymerase activity and contributes to the influenza virus host range. Moreover, ANP32A and ANP32B have been shown to cooperate with CRM1 to support HIV-1 RNA nuclear export [[cite:PUB00097999]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4xos", "name" "ANP32A LRR domain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032675", "name" "Leucine-rich repeat domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11375" "ACIDIC LEUCINE-RICH NUCLEAR PHOSPHOPROTEIN 32"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32", "short" "AN32"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1395, "taxa" 5593, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6184, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6184, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3994}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045081", :literature {"PUB00097998" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tochio N" "Umehara T" "Munemasa Y" "Suzuki T" "Sato S" "Tsuda K" "Koshiba S" "Kigawa T" "Nagai R" "Yokoyama S."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Solution structure of histone chaperone ANP32B: interaction with core histones H3-H4 through its acidic concave domain.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "97-114", "volume" "401", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20538007}, "PUB00098002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "29", "authors" ["Brody JR" "Kadkol SS" "Mahmoud MA" "Rebel JM" "Pasternack GR."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Identification of sequences required for inhibition of oncogene-mediated transformation by pp32.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "20053-5", "volume" "274", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10400610}, "PUB00098000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Fan Z" "Zhang H" "Zhang Q."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Death Differ", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Death Differ", "title" "Tumor suppressor pp32 represses cell growth through inhibition of transcription by blocking acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 and initiating its proapoptotic activity.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1485-94", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16341127}, "PUB00098001" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Bai J" "Brody JR" "Kadkol SS" "Pasternack GR."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Tumor suppression and potentiation by manipulation of pp32 expression.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "2153-60", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11360199}, "PUB00043547" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kim HE" "Jiang X" "Du F" "Wang X."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
