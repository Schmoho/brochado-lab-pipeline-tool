{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>An operon encoding 4 proteins required for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis (bcs) in Acetobacter xylinus (Gluconacetobacter xylinus) has been isolated via genetic complementation with strains lacking cellulose synthase activity [[cite:PUB00007624]]. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed the cellulose synthase operon to consist of 4 genes, designated bcsA, bcsB, bcsC and bcsD, all of which are required for maximal bacterial cellulose synthesis in A. xylinum.</p>\n\n<p>The calculated molecular mass of the protein encoded by bcsB is 85.3kDa [[cite:PUB00007624]]. BcsB encodes the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. The protein polymerises uridine 5'-diphosphate glucose to cellulose: UDP-glucose + (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)(N) = UDP + (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)(N+1). The enzyme is specifically activated by the nucleotide cyclic diguanylic acid. Sequence analysis suggests that BcsB contains several transmembrane (TM) domains, and shares a high degree of similarity with Escherichia coli YhjN.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR39083" "CYCLIC DI-GMP-BINDING PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF03170" "Bacterial cellulose synthase subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cellulose synthase BcsB, bacterial", "short" "Cell_synthase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 36, "proteomes" 1057, "taxa" 5637, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6805, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6588, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4749}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0658", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0658"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
