Members often occur as tandem homologous genes, such as BMA_0021 and BMA_0022 in Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344, or else have a duplication. The genes regularly are encoded near a cyclodehydrogenase/docking protein fusion protein of TOMM (thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins) biosynthetic clusters, suggesting a role in bacteriocin biosynthesis. The role of the putative natural product is unknown, but function as a two-chain bacteriocin is suggested.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03795" "BMA_0021/BMA_0022 family TOMM bacteriocin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal natural product, two-chain TOMM family", "short" "RNP_Burkhold"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 22, "taxa" 230, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 277, "sets" 0, "proteins" 239, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 194}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0901", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0901"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022261", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022261", "name" "Ribosomal natural product, two-chain TOMM family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
