{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a structural domain found in the cell division protein ZapA, as well as in related proteins. This domain has a core structure consisting of two layers alpha/beta, and has a long C-terminal helix that forms dimeric parallel and tetrameric antiparallel coiled coils [[cite:PUB00021077]]. ZapA interacts with FtsZ, where FtsZ is part of a mid-cell cytokinetic structure termed the Z-ring that recruits a hierarchy of fission related proteins early in the bacterial cell cycle. ZapA drives the polymerisation and filament bundling of FtsZ, thereby contributing to the spatio-temporal tuning of the Z-ring.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4p1m", "name" "The structure of Escherichia coli ZapA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036192", "name" "Cell division protein ZapA-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042233", "name" "Cell division protein ZapA, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR053712", "name" "Bacterial Cell Division Activator", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34981" "CELL DIVISION PROTEIN ZAPA"}, "pfam" {"PF05164" "Cell division protein ZapA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division protein ZapA-like", "short" "Cell_div_ZapA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 5928, "taxa" 22979, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25985, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25985, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20179}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007838", :literature {"PUB00021077" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Low HH" "Moncrieffe MC" "Lowe J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
