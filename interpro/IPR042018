{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry corresponds to a group of eukaryotic glycerol kinases (GKs), including members coded by X chromosome-linked GK genes, and glycerol kinase (GK)-like proteins, coded by autosomal testis-specific GK-like genes GK2, GK3 and Gykl1 (in mouse). These are thought to have arise by the transposition of Gk located on the X chromosome [[cite:PUB00086966]]. Sequence comparison shows that metazoan GKs and GK-like proteins in this family are closely related to the bacterial GKs, which catalyse the Mg-ATP dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to yield glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). The metazoan GKs do have GK enzymatic activity. However, the GK-like metazoan proteins do not exhibit GK activity and their biological functions are not yet clear [[cite:PUB00086967]]. Some of them lack important functional residues involved in the binding of ADP and Mg2+, which may result in the loss of GK catalytic function. Others that have conserved catalytic residues have lost their GK activity as well; the reason remains unclear. It has been suggested the conserved catalytic residues might facilitate them performing a distinct function. GK2 seem to be necessary for the formation of the mitochondrial sheath during spermatogenesis [[cite:PUB00092251], [cite:PUB00092252]].</p>\n\n<p>GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site [[cite:PUB00092250]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2w40", "name" "Crystal structure of Plasmodium falciparum glycerol kinase with bound glycerol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07792" "nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of metazoan glycerol kinase 1-3 (GK1-3) and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol kinase, metazoan-type", "short" "GK1-3_metazoan-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2216, "taxa" 7603, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6302, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6301, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3833}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
