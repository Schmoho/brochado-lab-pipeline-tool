These enzymes catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar, nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ([ec:2.4.1.-]) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [[cite:PUB00009409]]. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site. The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families. Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences, several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form 'clans'.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11927" "GALACTOSIDE 2-L-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01531" "Glycosyl transferase family 11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycosyl transferase, family 11", "short" "Glyco_trans_11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 120, "proteomes" 1136, "taxa" 6213, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7572, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7483, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5274}, "pathways" 219}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"cazy" {"displayName" "CAZy", "description" "Description of data source (to be defined in API)", "rank" 20, "accessions" [{"accession" "GT11", "url" "http://www.cazy.org/GT11.html"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1518", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1518"} {"accession" "GenProp1304", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1304"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
