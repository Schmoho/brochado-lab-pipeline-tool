{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transcription initiation factor TFIID is a multimeric protein complex that plays a central role in mediating promoter responses to various activators and repressors. The complex includes TATA binding protein (TBP) and various TBP-associated factors (TAFS). TFIID is a bona fide RNA polymerase II-specific TATA-binding protein-associated factor (TAF) and is essential for viability [[cite:PUB00007626]]. This entry represents one of the TAFs, TAF10.</p>\n\n<p>TFIID acts to nucleate the transcription complex, recruiting the rest of the factors through a direct interaction with TFIIB. The TBP subunit of TFIID is sufficient for TATA-element binding and TFIIB interaction, and can support basal transcription. The protein belongs to the TAF2H family.</p>\n\n<p>TAF10 is part of other transcription regulatory multiprotein complexes (e.g., SAGA, TBP-free TAF-containing complex [TFTC], STAGA, and PCAF/GCN5). Several TAFs interact via histone-fold motifs. The histone fold (HFD) is the interaction motif involved in heterodimerization of the core histones and their assembly into nucleosome octamer. The minimal HFD contains three Î±-helices linked by two loops. The HFD is found in core histones, TAFs and many other transcription factors. Five HF-containing TAF pairs have been described in TFIID: TAF6-TAF9, TAF4-TAF12, TAF11-TAF13, TAF8-TAF10 and TAF3-TAF10 [[cite:PUB00044510], [cite:PUB00079561], [cite:PUB00079562]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4wv4", "name" "Heterodimer of TAF8/TAF10"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03540" "Transcription initiation factor TFIID 23-30kDa subunit"}, "cdd" {"cd07982" "histone-fold domain found in transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 10 (TAF10) and similar proteins"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF017246" "Transcription initiation factor IID, TAF10 subunit"}, "panther" {"PTHR21242" "TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION FACTOR TFIID SUBUNIT 10"}, "prints" {"PR01443" "TFIID30KDSUB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription initiation factor TFIID, subunit 10", "short" "TAF10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 53, "proteomes" 2465, "taxa" 8386, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4100, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4080, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2658}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2054", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2054"} {"accession" "GenProp2057", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2057"} {"accession" "GenProp2052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003923", :literature {"PUB00007626" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Klebanow ER" "Poon D" "Zhou S" "Weil PA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
