{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17B-HSDs), a group of enzymes which catalyse the last step in the biosynthesis of all androgens and estrogens -the reversible NAD(P)-linked transfer of a hydride to and from the 17-position of steroid molecules [[cite:PUB00028053]]. A total of six isozymes have been identified which vary in substrate specificity, tissue specificity and preferred direction of the reaction.</p>\n\n<p>The most intensively studied enzyme in this entry is human estrogenic 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ([swissprot:P14061]) which is responsible for the last step in the synthesis of all estrogens. As active estrogens stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells, this enzyme is a potential target for drugs to treat breast cancer [[cite:PUB00024639]]. It is a membrane-associated homodimer which posseses the  Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif typical of short-chain dehydrogenases and forms a typical Rossman fold [[cite:PUB00023623]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Retinol dehydrogenase 8 which is closely related to 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 [[cite:PUB00095624]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1a27", "name" "HUMAN 17-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID-DEHYDROGENASE TYPE 1 C-TERMINAL DELETION MUTANT COMPLEXED WITH ESTRADIOL AND NADP+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000095" "Estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "17beta-dehydrogenase", "short" "17beta_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 568, "taxa" 1998, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1709, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1666, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1084}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
