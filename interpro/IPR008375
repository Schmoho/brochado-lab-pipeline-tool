{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Staphylococcus aureus is a well-characterised and specialised prokaryotic human pathogen, expressing a variety of virulence factors to enable successful infection of the host. Symptoms usually manifest in cases of food poisoning, pyrogenic fever and toxic shock syndrome, and can prove lethal in immunocompromised patients. Of all the exotoxins secreted from the bacterial cell, superantigens and hemolysins are amongst the most studied.</p>\n\n<p>A novel gene cluster encoding several new superantigen exotoxin-like virulence factors has been isolated from S. aureus [[cite:PUB00011690]]. Although the gene products elicit classic symptoms of pyrogenic fever and food poisoning in susceptible animal models, their overall similarity to sequences of known superantigens and hemolysins is limited. However, they do share regions of higher similarity in several key functional domains, leading these moieties to be termed Staphylococcal Exotoxin-like Enterotoxins (SETs), 15 of which have so far been isolated from pathogenic strains [[cite:PUB00011690]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of S. aureus Set3 enterotoxin has been resolved to 1.9A by means of X-ray crystallography. It reveals the two-fold structure characteristic of the superantigen superfamily: an N-terminal OB fold and a C-terminal β-grasp domain, joined by an N-terminal α-helix. However, it differs significantly in several places. β-strands 6 and 7 protrude from the molecular surface in the β-grasp domain, unlike the usually smooth surface of other superantigens. Also, there appears to be a large, saddle-shaped positively-charged surface capable of binding negatively-charged molecules, such as DNA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008992", "name" "Enterotoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016091", "name" "Superantigen toxin, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01800" "STAPHEXOTOXN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Staphylococcus aureus exotoxin", "short" "Staph_exotoxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4, "taxa" 49, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1698, "sets" 0, "proteins" 457, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 358}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
