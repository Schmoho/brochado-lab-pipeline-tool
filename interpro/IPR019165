Secondly, it is involved in the correct assembly of the membrane-embedded ATPase CF(0) particle, probably mediating association of ATP6 with the subunit 9 ring [[cite:PUB00045070], [cite:PUB00045278]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09768" "Peptidase M76 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR21711" "MITOCHONDRIAL INNER MEMBRANE PROTEASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M76, ATP23", "short" "Peptidase_M76_ATP23"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 57, "proteomes" 2427, "taxa" 8436, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4545, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4427, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2932}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
