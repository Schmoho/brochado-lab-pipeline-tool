{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases catalyse the reversible oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide as shown below [[cite:PUB00032801], [cite:PUB00015703]]:\r\n<reaction>CO + H(2)O + A == CO(2) + AH(2)</reaction>\r\nA variety of electron acceptors can be used by these enzymes including ferredoxin, methyl viologen and benzyl viologen. Under anaerobic conditions, carbon monoxide is utilised by a number of methanogenic archaea and acetogenic, sulphate-reducing or phototrophic bacteria.  Under aerobic conditions carbon monoxide can be used as sole carbon and energy source by the carboxidotrophic bacteria, a taxonomically diverse group of obligate or facultative chemolithoautotrophic species. The anaerobic dehydrogenases are mostly nickel-containing iron-sulphur enzymes, while the The aerobic enzymes categorised so far are molybdenum-containing iron-sulphur proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the large subunit of the molybdenum-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase found in aerobic bacteria. This enzyme is a dimer of heterotrimers, where each heterotrimer consists of a small iron-sulphur subunit, a medium FAD-containing flavoprotein subunit and a large molybdopterin-containign subunit which contains the active site [[cite:PUB00019122], [cite:PUB00015665]]. The large subunit is divided into two domains. The N-terminal domain is composed of mainly of a five-and four-stranded mixed β-sheet and interacts with the small and medium subunits. The C-terminal domain contains a region which interacts with its counterpart in the overall dimer, providing the main dimer contact, and a β-sheet surrounded by α helices. The active site located in this subunit contains a novel dinuclear heterometal [CuSMo(=O)OH] cluster.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1n62", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Mo,Cu-CO Dehydrogenase (CODH), n-butylisocyanide-bound state"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037165", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, molybdopterin binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02416" "aerobic carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase, large subunit", "short" "CO_Mo_DH_lsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 484, "taxa" 2079, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1692, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1692, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1306}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
