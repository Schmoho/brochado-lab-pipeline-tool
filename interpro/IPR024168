{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Catalase is a ubiquitous enzyme found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes involved in the protection of cells from the toxic effects of peroxides. It catalyses the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen.

This entry contains uncharacterized proteins similar to the Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 periplasmic protein srpA, of mostly bacterial origin.
