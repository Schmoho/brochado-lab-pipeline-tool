{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Protein SPO16 homologue (SPO16, also known as Synaptonemal complex reinforcing element SCRE), including the mammalian orthologue of budding yeast Spo16. It plays a key role in reinforcing the integrity of the central element of the synaptonemal complex (SC), resulting in the SC stabilization which ensures the progression of meiotic prophase I in male and female germ cells [[cite:PUB00096702]. It promotes homologous recombination and crossing-over in meiotic prophase I via its association with SHOC1 [[cite:PUB00096701]]. It is also required for the localization of TEX11 and MSH4 to recombination intermediates [[cite:PUB00096701]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15162" "Protein SPO16 homolog"}, "panther" {"PTHR31408" "HYPOTHETICAL PROTEIN LOC689986"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein SPO16 homolog", "short" "SCRE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 384, "taxa" 1627, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 565, "sets" 0, "proteins" 561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 332}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027857", :literature {"PUB00096702" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Liu H" "Huang T" "Li M" "Li M" "Zhang C" "Jiang J" "Yu X" "Yin Y" "Zhang F" "Lu G" "Luo MC" "Zhang LR" "Li J" "Liu K" "Chen ZJ."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "SCRE serves as a unique synaptonemal complex fastener and is essential for progression of meiosis prophase I in mice.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "5670-5683", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30949703}, "PUB00096701" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zhang Q" "Ji SY" "Busayavalasa K" "Yu C."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Adv", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Adv", "title" "SPO16 binds SHOC1 to promote homologous recombination and crossing-over in meiotic prophase I.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "eaau9780", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30746471}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007130", "name" "synaptonemal complex assembly", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR027857", "name" "Protein SPO16 homolog", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 10, "alignment:full" 400}}}
