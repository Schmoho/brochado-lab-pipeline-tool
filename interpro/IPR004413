The reaction takes place in the presence of glutamine and ATP through an activated phospho-Asp-tRNA(Asn) or phospho-Glu-tRNA(Gln) [[cite:PUB00007932]]. The enzyme is composed of three subunits: A (an amidase), B and C. It also exists in eukaryotes as a protein targeted to the mitochondria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heterotrimer GatABC is involved in converting Glu to Gln and/or Asp to Asn, when the amino acid is attached to the appropriate tRNA. In Lactobacillus, GatABC is responsible for producing tRNA(Gln). In Archaea, GatABC is responsible for producing tRNA(Asn), while GatDE is responsible for producing tRNA(Gln).
