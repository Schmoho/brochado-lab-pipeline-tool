{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A) family of proteins, also known as Ferroportin 1 (or simply ferroportin (FPN), the major iron transporter key in cellular and systemic iron levels balance. In mammals, it mediates the absorption of dietary iron by transporting ferrous iron across the basolateral surface of duodenal enterocytes and can also recycle iron from hepatocytes and macrophages. FPN is also involved in iron transfer between maternal and fetal circulation [[cite:PUB00054047], [cite:PUB00099592], [cite:PUB00099591]]. FPN synthesis is transcriptionally regulated by cellular hypoxia, iron and heme concentrations, and inflammatory signalling, while cell surface FPN is negatively regulated by hepcidin, which, under elevated serum iron levels, it blocks iron transport and induces FPN ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation [[cite:PUB00099592]]. Structural studies in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorous suggest that the putative substrate-binding site is localized deep in the N-terminal domain and demonstrated that Ca facilitates a conformational change critical to the transport cycle [[cite:PUB00099593]]. In humans, mutations in this transporter leads to nonclassical ferroportin disease (FD), a form of hereditary hemochromatosis [[cite:PUB00099591]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11660" "SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 40 MEMBER"}, "cdd" {"cd17480" "Solute carrier family 40 member 1 of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters"}, "pfam" {"PF06963" "Ferroportin1 (FPN1)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferroportin-1", "short" "Ferroportin-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 124, "proteomes" 1989, "taxa" 6687, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5745, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5352, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3351}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009716", :literature {"PUB00054047" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["McKie AT" "Marciani P" "Rolfs A" "Brennan K" "Wehr K" "Barrow D" "Miret S" "Bomford A" "Peters TJ" "Farzaneh F" "Hediger MA" "Hentze MW" "Simpson RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
