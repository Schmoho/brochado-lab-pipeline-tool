It catalyses the sequential transfer of two alpha1,2-linked mannose residues from GDP-mannose to Man3GlcNAc2-PP-Dol forming the Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol intermediate at the cytosolic side of the ER before flipping to the luminal side. Alg11 contains three hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning helices found in the N-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00076064]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45919" "GDP-MAN:MAN(3)GLCNAC(2)-PP-DOL ALPHA-1,2-MANNOSYLTRANSFERASE"}, "cdd" {"cd03806" "alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase ALG11 and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ALG11 mannosyltransferase", "short" "ALG11"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2711, "taxa" 10495, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6259, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6259, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4358}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
