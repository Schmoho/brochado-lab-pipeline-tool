{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides). GldG is a protein linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Knockouts of GldG abolish the gliding phenotype [[cite:PUB00045356]]. GldG, along with GldA and GldF are believed to compose an ABC transporter [[cite:PUB00045356]] and are observed as an operon. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species C. johnsonae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein family appear to have all of the genes associated with gliding motility.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03521" "gliding motility-associated ABC transporter substrate-binding protein GldG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding-associated putative ABC transporter substrate-binding GldG", "short" "Motility-assoc_ABC-rel_GldG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 774, "taxa" 2480, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2715, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2715, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2082}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019863", :literature {"PUB00045356" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Hunnicutt DW" "Kempf MJ" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
