{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of DNA-binding transcriptional activators for natural product biosynthesis in Streptomyces and related species found mainly in Actinomycetes. Transcriptional regulator NovE has been found to specifically regulate expression of genes involved in the novobiocin biosynthesis pathway [[cite:PUB00153099]]. NovE acts as a positive regulator of transcription but does not bind DNA [[cite:PUB00153100]]. Besides NovE, this family includes LmbU (lincomycin), CouE (coumermycin A1), CloE (clorobiocin), and HrmB (hormaomycin).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038070" "LmbU family transcriptional regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NovE/LmbU-like transcriptional regulators", "short" "NovE/LmbU-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 145, "taxa" 460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 428, "sets" 0, "proteins" 428, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 327}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049735", :literature {"PUB00153099" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Dangel V" "Eustaquio AS" "Gust B" "Heide L."], "ISO_journal" "Arch Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00203-008-0396-0", "medline_journal" "Arch Microbiol", "title" "novE and novG act as positive regulators of novobiocin biosynthesis.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "509-19", "volume" "190", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18568336}, "PUB00153100" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 12", "authors" ["Dangel V" "Harle J" "Goerke C" "Wolz C" "Gust B" "Pernodet JL" "Heide L."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.032649-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology (Reading)", "title" "Transcriptional regulation of the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "4025-4035", "volume" "155", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19762445}, "PUB00105549" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Hou B" "Zhu X" "Kang Y" "Wang R" "Wu H" "Ye J" "Zhang H."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "LmbU, a Cluster-Situated Regulator for Lincomycin, Consists of a DNA-Binding Domain, an Auto-Inhibitory Domain, and Forms Homodimer.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "989", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31130942}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049735", "name" "NovE/LmbU-like transcriptional regulators", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
