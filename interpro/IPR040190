{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase (MurQ) is an enzyme involved in peptidoglycan recycling in Escherichia coli. In cyanobacteria MurQ may promote low-light adaptation through peptidoglycan recycling [[cite:PUB00091066]]. MurQ contains a sugar isomerase (SIS) domain with similarity to the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) in humans [[cite:PUB00005498]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GCKR regulates glucokinase (GK), an enzyme responsible for regulating the uptake and storage of dietary glucose [[cite:PUB00067028]]. In the liver, GKRP forms an inhibitory complex with glucokinase (GCK). The disruption and reformation of this complex occurs in response to direct binding of glucose to GCK, and fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to GKRP [[cite:PUB00090678]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4bb9", "name" "Crystal structure of glucokinase regulatory protein complexed to fructose-1-phosphate"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10088" "GLUCOKINASE REGULATORY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase/glucokinase regulatory protein", "short" "MURQ/GCKR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4423, "taxa" 17776, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19674, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19674, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14689}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
