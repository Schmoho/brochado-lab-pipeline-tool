{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes UL25 proteins from human cytomelagovirus (HCMV), as well as U14 proteins from the human herpesviruses HHV-6 and HHV-7. These 85kDa phosphoproteins appear to act as structural antigens, but their precise function is otherwise unknown. This entry also includes protein M35 from Murid herpesvirus 1. M35 is released by murine cytomegalovirus immediately upon infection in order to deftly inhibit the antiviral type I IFN response by targeting NF-kappaB-mediated transcription [[cite:PUB00088048]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5b1q", "name" "Human herpesvirus 6B tegument protein U14"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04637" "Herpesvirus phosphoprotein 85 (HHV6-7 U14/HCMV UL25)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Herpesvirus phosphoprotein 85 (HHV6-7 U14/HCMV UL25)", "short" "Herpes_pp85"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 27, "taxa" 209, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 245, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006731", :literature {"PUB00088048" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Chan B" "Goncalves Magalhaes V" "Lemmermann NAW" "Juranic Lisnic V" "Stempel M" "Bussey KA" "Reimer E" "Podlech J" "Lienenklaus S" "Reddehase MJ" "Jonjic S" "Brinkmann MM."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006382", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "The murine cytomegalovirus M35 protein antagonizes type I IFN induction downstream of pattern recognition receptors by targeting NF-ÎºB mediated transcription.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "e1006382", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28542326}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006731", "name" "Herpesvirus phosphoprotein 85 (HHV6-7 U14/HCMV UL25)", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 48}}}
