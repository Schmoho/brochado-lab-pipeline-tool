{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Aca2 repressor from Pectobacterium phage ZF40, the uncharacterised protein YdiL from Escherichia coli and similar sequences found in tailed bacteriophages, proteobacteria and actinomycetes. Aca2 regulates the transcription and translation of phage anti-CRISPR acrIF8 gene through DNA binding to 2 inverted repeats in the promoter region and translationally by binding conserved RNA stem-loops on mRNAs thereby blocking ribosome access [[cite:PUB00158950], [cite:PUB00158952]]. This protein contains six α-helices and two parallel β-strands [[cite:PUB00158951]]. The function of YdiL, which is predicted to adopt a very similar structure, is still unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1s4k", "name" "Putative cytoplasmic protein from Salmonella typhimurium"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010982", "name" "Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027910", "name" "YdiL domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08965" "Domain of unknown function (DUF1870)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aca2/YdiL-like", "short" "Aca2_YdiL-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 62, "taxa" 748, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 754, "sets" 0, "proteins" 754, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 607}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015060", :literature {"PUB00158950" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Birkholz N" "Fagerlund RD" "Smith LM" "Jackson SA" "Fineran PC."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz721", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The autoregulator Aca2 mediates anti-CRISPR repression.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "9658-9665", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31428783}, "PUB00158951" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Liu Y" "Zhang L" "Guo M" "Chen L" "Wu B" "Huang H."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101357", "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Structural basis for anti-CRISPR repression mediated by bacterial operon proteins Aca1 and Aca2.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "101357", "volume" "297", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34756887}, "PUB00158952" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8021", "authors" ["Birkholz N" "Kamata K" "Feussner M" "Wilkinson ME" "Cuba Samaniego C" "Migur A" "Kimanius D" "Ceelen M" "Went SC" "Usher B" "Blower TR" "Brown CM" "Beisel CL" "Weinberg Z" "Fagerlund RD" "Jackson SA" "Fineran PC."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07644-1", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Phage anti-CRISPR control by an RNA- and DNA-binding helix-turn-helix protein.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "670-677", "volume" "631", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38987591}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015060", "name" "Aca2/YdiL-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 62}}}
