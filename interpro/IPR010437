{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family describes a small protein, always smaller than 100 amino acids, encoded in pathogenicity islands for bacterial type III secretion systems in various strains of Yersinia, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, as well as Chromobacterium violaceum and Citrobacter rodentium, which are part of the EscG/YscG/SsaH family of type III secretion system needle protein co-chaperones [[cite:PUB00106879]]. In Edwardsiella piscicida, this protein is called EsaH and homologous to Salmonella SPI2 protein SsaH, which has been reported to be one of the chaperones of the Salmonella SPI2 needle protein SsaG [[cite:PUB00106881]]. EsaH forms a complex with EscE, which is analogous to T3SS needle chaperones, and controls the \nT3SS protein secretion by stabilizing EsaG whose secretion in turn leads to the secretion of the middle and late T3SS substrates [[cite:PUB00106879]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7y6b", "name" "Crystal structure of the EscE/EsaH complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06287" "Protein of unknown function (DUF1039)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02498" "EscG/YscG/SsaH family type III secretion system needle protein co-chaperone"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system SsaH/EsaH", "short" "T3SS_SsaH/EsaH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 530, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 604, "sets" 0, "proteins" 604, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 528}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010437", :literature {"PUB00106879" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zeng ZX" "Liu LY" "Xiao SB" "Lu JF" "Liu YL" "Li J" "Zhou YZ" "Liao LJ" "Li DY" "Zhou Y" "Nie P" "Xie HX."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Secreted in a Type III Secretion System-Dependent Manner, EsaH and EscE Are the Cochaperones of the T3SS Needle Protein EsaG of Edwardsiella piscicida.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "e0125022", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35861543}, "PUB00106881" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Takaya A" "Takeda H" "Tashiro S" "Kawashima H" "Yamamoto T."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Chaperone-mediated secretion switching from early to middle substrates in the type III secretion system encoded by <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenicity island 2.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "3783-3793", "volume" "294", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30651351}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010437", "name" "Type III secretion system SsaH/EsaH", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 39}}}
