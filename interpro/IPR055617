{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of viral proteins that are found in various bacteriophages infecting Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Erwinia, Ralstonia, and Klebsiella. The family members are typically 800-1200 residues in length. Many are annotated as putative virion structural proteins, suggesting they may play a role in phage particle structure or assembly. However, the precise function of this family remains unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23823" "Family of unknown function (DUF7193)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7193", "short" "DUF7193"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 57, "taxa" 353, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 189, "sets" 0, "proteins" 184, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055617", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055617", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7193", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 67}}}
