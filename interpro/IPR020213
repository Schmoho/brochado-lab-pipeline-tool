{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Toxin coregulated pilus biosynthesis protein S (TcpS) is part of an operon associated with biosynthesis of the toxin coregulated pilus (TCP) of Vibrio cholerae [[cite:PUB00045958]]. TCP is essential for successful colonisation of the bacteria in the small intestine. The genes tcpR, tcpD, tcpS, tcpT, tcpE and tcpF are organised to permit translational coupling and are followed by an inverted repeat structure which is likely to act as a strong Rho-independent terminator [[cite:PUB00045959]]. TcpS possesses an N-terminal signal sequence, suggesting that it is localised to the periplasm.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17456" "Toxin-coregulated pilus protein S"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin coregulated pilus biosynthesis protein TcpS", "short" "Toxin-coreg_pilus_synth_TcpS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 28, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020213", :literature {"PUB00045958" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Rahman MH" "Biswas K" "Hossain MA" "Sack RB" "Mekalanos JJ" "Faruque SM."], "ISO_journal" "DNA Cell Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dna.2008.0737", "medline_journal" "DNA Cell Biol", "title" "Distribution of genes for virulence and ecological fitness among diverse Vibrio cholerae population in a cholera endemic area: tracking the evolution of pathogenic strains.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "347-55", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18462070}, "PUB00045959" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ogierman MA" "Zabihi S" "Mourtzios L" "Manning PA."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(93)90589-U", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Genetic organization and sequence of the promoter-distal region of the tcp gene cluster of Vibrio cholerae.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "51-60", "volume" "126", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8097178}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020213", "name" "Toxin coregulated pilus biosynthesis protein TcpS", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 3}}}
