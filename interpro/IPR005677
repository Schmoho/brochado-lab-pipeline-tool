{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fumarate hydratase class II (also known as Fumarase C) catalyses the stereospecific interconversion of fumarate to L-malate as part of the metabolic citric acid or Kreb's cycle. The recent three-dimensional structure of fumarase C from Escherichia coli has identified a binding site for anions which is generated by side chains from three of the four subunits within the tetramer. These same side chains are found in the three most highly conserved regions within the class II fumarate hydratase family. Putative fumarases from several species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) branch deeply, although within the same branch of a phylogenetic tree rooted by aspartate ammonia-lyase sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5upp", "name" "Crystal structure of human fumarate hydratase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008948", "name" "L-Aspartase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01362" "Class II fumarases"}, "hamap" {"MF_00743" "Fumarate hydratase class II [fumC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00979" "class II fumarate hydratase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11444" "ASPARTATEAMMONIA/ARGININOSUCCINATE/ADENYLOSUCCINATE LYASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fumarate hydratase, class II", "short" "Fum_hydII"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 50, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9509, "taxa" 34948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37259, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37255, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28133}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp0033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0033"} {"accession" "GenProp1267", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1267"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
