{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The SRAP (SOS-response associated peptidase) family is characterised by the SRAP domain with a novel thiol autopeptidase activity, whose active site in human HMCES is comprised of the catalytic triad residues C2, E127, and H210 [[cite:PUB00093990]]. SRAP proteins are evolutionarily conserved in all domains of life. For instance, human HMCES and E. coli YedK are similar in both sequence and structure [[cite:PUB00093989]]. HMCES was originally identified as a possible reader of 5hmC in embryonic stem cell extracts using a double-stranded DNA molecule containing 5hmC as bait [[cite:PUB00093992]]. The bacterial members have operonic associations with the SOS DNA damage response, mutagenic translesion DNA polymerases, non-homologous DNA-ending-joining networks that employ Ku and an ATP-dependent ligase, and other repair systems [[cite:PUB00075418]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5ko9", "name" "Crystal Structure of the SRAP Domain of Human HMCES Protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036590", "name" "SOS response associated peptidase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13604" "DC12-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF02586" "SOS response associated peptidase (SRAP)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SOS response associated peptidase (SRAP)", "short" "SRAP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 126, "proteomes" 8250, "taxa" 29393, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37199, "sets" 0, "proteins" 36957, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27998}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003738", :literature {"PUB00093989" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Thompson PS" "Amidon KM" "Mohni KN" "Cortez D" "Eichman BF."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
