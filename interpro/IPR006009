{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The murG gene of Escherichia coli encodes the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine--N-acetylmuramyl-(pentapeptide) pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol N-acetylglucosamine transferase, responsible for the final step in the formation of the lipid-linked disaccharide-pentapeptide subunit of peptidoglycan [[cite:PUB00080974]]. It transfers N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to the C4 hydroxyl of a lipid-linked N-acetylmuramoyl pentapeptide (NAM). The resulting disaccharide is then transported across the cell membrane, where it is polymerized into NAG-NAM cell-wall repeat structure. The enzyme is peripherally associated with the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, the peptidoglycan subunit is completely assembled before it traverses the cytoplasmic membrane [[cite:PUB00033163]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MurG belongs to the GT-B structural superfamily of glycoslytransferases, which have characteristic N-and C-terminal domains, each containing a typical Rossmann fold [[cite:PUB00024731]]. The two domains have high structural homology despite minimal sequence homology.  The large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic centre and permits a high degree of flexibility.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1f0k", "name" "THE 1.9 ANGSTROM CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF E.
