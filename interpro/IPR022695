{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH) catalyses the terminal step in the biosynthesis of histidine in bacteria, fungi, and plants, the four-electron oxidation of L-histidinol to histidine.</p>\n<p>In 4-electron dehydrogenases, a single active site catalyses 2 separate oxidation steps: oxidation of the substrate alcohol to an intermediate aldehyde; and oxidation of the aldehyde to the product acid, in this case His [[cite:PUB00000285]]. The reaction proceeds via a tightly- or covalently-bound inter-mediate, and requires the presence of 2 NAD molecules [[cite:PUB00000285]]. By contrast with most dehydrogenases, the substrate is bound before the NAD coenzyme [[cite:PUB00000285]]. A Cys residue has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the second oxidative step [[cite:PUB00000285]].</p>\n<p>In bacteria HDH is a single chain polypeptide; in fungi it is the C-terminal domain of a multifunctional enzyme which catalyses three different steps of histidine biosynthesis; and in plants it is expressed as nuclear encoded protein precursor which is exported to the chloroplast [[cite:PUB00004740]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents histidinol dehydrogenase [ec:1.1.1.23].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1kae", "name" "L-HISTIDINOL DEHYDROGENASE (HISD) STRUCTURE COMPLEXED WITH L-HISTIDINOL (SUBSTRATE), ZINC AND NAD (COFACTOR)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000099" "Histidinol dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidinol dehydrogenase, monofunctional", "short" "Histidinol_DH_monofunct"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8823, "taxa" 33173, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 40324, "sets" 0, "proteins" 40151, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 30832}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
