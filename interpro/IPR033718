{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This mostly bacterial family of homo-trimeric integral membrane enzymes, the products of the dgkA gene, catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. Escherichia coli DAGK participates in the membrane-derived oligosaccharide cycle (MDO cycle) by recycling lipids to restore phosphatidylglycerols that were used up in the biosynthesis of MDOs. DAGK also recycles diacylglycerols that are produced during the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) back to phospholipids. DAGK is not the main source of phosphatidic acid in de novo biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids. Escherichia coli DAGK has low activity as an undecaprenol kinase [[cite:PUB00080164], [cite:PUB00080161], [cite:PUB00080165]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036945", "name" "Diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14264" "Integral membrane diacylglycerol kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diacylglycerol kinase, prokaryotic", "short" "DAGK_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1914, "taxa" 9463, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10487, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10487, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8189}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
