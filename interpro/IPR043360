{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PP2B (calcineurin) is a unique serine/threonine protein phosphatase in its regulation by a second messenger (calcium acting via calmodulin) [[cite:PUB00093898], [cite:PUB00093896]]. PP2B is involved in many biological processes including immune responses, the second messenger cAMP pathway, sodium/potassium ion transport in the nephron, cell cycle progression in lower eukaryotes, cardiac hypertrophy and memory formation. PP2B is highly conserved from yeast to humans, but is absent from plants. PP2B is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (CnA) and a regulatory subunit (CnB); CnB contains four Ca2 binding motifs referred to as EF hands [[cite:PUB00091766]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ll8", "name" "Crystal Structure of Calcineurin in Complex with AKAP79 Peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029052", "name" "Metallo-dependent phosphatase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45673" "SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2B CATALYTIC SUBUNIT 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PP2B", "short" "PP2B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2376, "taxa" 8015, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11826, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11826, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7316}, "pathways" 33}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
