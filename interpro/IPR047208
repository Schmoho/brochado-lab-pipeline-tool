FOXG1 acts as a transcription repression factor which plays an important role in the establishment of the regional subdivision of the developing brain and in the development of the telencephalon. It is repetitively used in the sequential events of telencephalic development to control multi-steps of brain circuit formation ranging from cell cycle control to neuronal differentiation in a clade- and species-specific manner [[cite:PUB00102218]]. Individuals with mutations in FOXG1 harbour \"FOXG1-related encephalopathy\", characterised by two clinical phenotypes/syndromes including microcephaly, developmental delay, severe cognitive disabilities, early-onset dyskinesia and hyperkinetic movements, stereotypies, epilepsy, and cerebral malformation for those with deletions or intragenic mutations of FOXG1 [[cite:PUB00102210], [cite:PUB00102211], [cite:PUB00102216]].
