{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The WapI family comprises immunity proteins that are part of a toxin-immunity protein module functioning as a cellular contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) system. These proteins neutralize the tRNase activity of their cognate toxin WapA upon expression in E.coli [[cite:PUB00088067], [cite:PUB00101092]]. Notably, they do not inhibit WapA from other strains of Bacillus subtilis. The WapA C-terminal cannot be expressed independently in E.coli, but can be cloned when its cognate immunity protein gene is present. The structure of these proteins resembles the fold of the Whirly ssDNA binding proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24716" "Immunity protein WapI-like family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunity protein WapI-like", "short" "WapI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 363, "taxa" 2076, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1240, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1240, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 935}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056510", :literature {"PUB00088067" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Koskiniemi S" "Lamoureux JG" "Nikolakakis KC" "t'Kint de Roodenbeke C" "Kaplan MD" "Low DA" "Hayes CS."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
