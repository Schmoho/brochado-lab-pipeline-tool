{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two-pore segment channels (TPCs or TPCNs) are located in membranes of acidic intracellular organelles (such as endo-lysosomes and plant vacuoles) and contain two putative pore-forming repeats. Each of these repeats contains six transmembrane segments and an intervening pore-loop, an architecture featured in voltage-gated channels [[cite:PUB00069649]]. Functional TPC channels are assembled from two TPC protein subunits forming a pore that conducts mainly Ca2  and Na. TPCs exist as three isoforms (TPC1-3): TPC1 and TPC2 are the most universal isoforms since TPC3 is absent from the genomes of many animals including those of human, mice, rats and flies [[cite:PUB00069649]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents TPC1 from animals [[cite:PUB00069314], [cite:PUB00069315]]. TPC1 was first identified as an NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate)-regulated Ca2+ channel. Later it was shown to serve as a voltage-gated highly-selective Na+ channel activated directly by PI(3,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate) that senses pH changes and confers electrical excitability to organelles [[cite:PUB00069315], [cite:PUB00099613], [cite:PUB00099614], [cite:PUB00099612], [cite:PUB00099619]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46474" "TWO PORE CALCIUM CHANNEL PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Two pore channel protein 1", "short" "TPC1_animal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 823, "taxa" 3220, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1878, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1878, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1160}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028801", :literature {"PUB00069649" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Zhu MX" "Ma J" "Parrington J" "Calcraft PJ" "Galione A" "Evans AM."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
