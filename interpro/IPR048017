{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from alphaproteobacteria that contain the domain of unknown function DUF1612 ([interpro:IPR011670]), including the uncharacterized protein y4cF from Sinorhizobium fredii. Members often also possess the HTH DNA binding domain ([interpro:IPR021068]), suggesting DNA-binding activity. RHE_PE00001 from Rhizobium etli ([swissprot:Q2JZZ6]), which also belongs to this family, was shown to be essential for growth on rich medium, despite being encoded on a plasmid [[cite:PUB00106038]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF040876" "RHE_PE00001 family protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterized protein y4cF-like", "short" "Y4cF-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 138, "taxa" 749, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1245, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1245, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 998}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048017", :literature {"PUB00106038" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Landeta C" "Davalos A" "Cevallos MA" "Geiger O" "Brom S" "Romero D."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Plasmids with a chromosome-like role in rhizobia.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1317-26", "volume" "193", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21217003}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048017", "name" "Uncharacterized protein y4cF-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
