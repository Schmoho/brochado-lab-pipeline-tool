{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ribosome assembly factor mrt4 and related proteins. Mrt4 is a ribosomal stalk protein uL10 (also known as P0 or Rpp0) paralogue involved in ribosome biogenesis and mRNA turnover  [[cite:PUB00045051], [cite:PUB00081490]]. uL10 (P0) is cytoplasmic and is present in cytoplasmic pre-60S particles and mature 60S subunits. Mrt4, however, is nuclear and has been identified in pre-60S ribosome complexes but not in mature 60S subunits, suggesting that it binds ribosomes at an early stage of assembly in the nucleolus and during assembly it is exchanged for uL10 (P0). The dual-specificity phosphatase Yvh1 is required for Mrt4 displacement from the pre-60S subunit [[cite:PUB00081491]]. P0 is required for the release of Mrt4 and exchanges with this factor at the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00081492]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4nwb", "name" "Crystal structure of Mrt4"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043141", "name" "Large ribosomal subunit protein uL10-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05796" "Ribosomal_P0_like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome assembly factor Mrt4", "short" "Mrt4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 99, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2424, "taxa" 8416, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3910, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2554}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033867", :literature {"PUB00081492" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Rodriguez-Mateos M" "Garcia-Gomez JJ" "Francisco-Velilla R" "Remacha M" "de la Cruz J" "Ballesta JP."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp806", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Role and dynamics of the ribosomal protein P0 and its related trans-acting factor Mrt4 during ribosome assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "7519-32", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19789271}, "PUB00081491" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Lo KY" "Li Z" "Wang F" "Marcotte EM" "Johnson AW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
