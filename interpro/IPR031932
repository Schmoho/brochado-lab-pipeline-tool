{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Translation of the arterivirus genome results in two large precursor polyproteins, pp1a and the C-terminally extended frameshift product pp1ab. These proteins are cleaved by up to four virus-encoded proteases to yield at least 13 nonstructural proteins (nsps) (nsp1 to nsp12, including nsp7) plus a substantial number of processing intermediates of unknown function. Nsp7 can be internally cleaved by the nsp4 protease, yielding small amounts of nsp7alpha and nsp7beta.
