{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8 (Prp8) is a central component of the spliceosome, which may play a role in aligning the pre-mRNA 5'- and 3'-exons for ligation. It interacts with U5 snRNA, and with pre-mRNA 5'-splice sites in B spliceosomes and 3'-splice sites in C spliceosomes. It is part of the U5 snRNP complex, and of U5.4/6 and U5.U4atac/U6atac snRNP complexes in U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes, respectively. It is also found in a mRNA splicing-dependent exon junction complex (EJC) with SRRM1 where it interacts with U5 snRNP proteins SNRP116 and WDR57/SPF38 [[cite:PUB00044473], [cite:PUB00044758]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutations of human Prp8 cause retinitis pigmentosa 13, a retinal dystrophy belonging to the group of pigmentary retinopathies [[cite:PUB00066910]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4jk8", "name" "Open and closed forms of R1865A human PRP8 RNase H-like domain with bound Mg ion"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042516", "name" "Pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8, U5-snRNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043172", "name" "Prp8 RNase domain IV, palm region", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR043173", "name" "Prp8 RNase domain IV, fingers region", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11140" "PRE-MRNA SPLICING FACTOR PRP8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8", "short" "PRP8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 544, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2623, "taxa" 9387, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6736, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6736, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1835}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027652", :literature {"PUB00066910" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["McKie AB" "McHale JC" "Keen TJ" "Tarttelin EE" "Goliath R" "van Lith-Verhoeven JJ" "Greenberg J" "Ramesar RS" "Hoyng CB" "Cremers FP" "Mackey DA" "Bhattacharya SS" "Bird AC" "Markham AF" "Inglehearn CF."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
