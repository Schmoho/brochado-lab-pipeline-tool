{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases ([ec:2.7.7.6]) transcribing different sets of genes. Each class of RNA polymerase is an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides. In archaebacteria, there is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also consists of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides. Archaebacterial subunit Rpo10 (gene rpoN) [[cite:PUB00004866]] is a small protein of about 8kDa, it is evolutionary related [[cite:PUB00002250]] to a 8.3kDa component shared by all three forms of eukaryotic RNA polymerases (RPABC5, gene Rpb10 in yeast and POLR2J in mammals) as well as to African swine fever virus (ASFV) protein CP80R [[cite:PUB00015097]].</p>\n\n<p>This family includes both archaeal subunit N, also known as Rpo10 following the eukaryotic nomenclature [[cite:PUB00059148]], and eukaryotic Rpb10. There is a conserved region which is located at the N-terminal extremity of these polymerase subunits; this region contains two cysteines that bind a zinc ion [[cite:PUB00015096]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023580", "name" "RNA polymerase subunit RPB10", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23431" "DNA-DIRECTED RNA POLYMERASES I, II, AND III SUBUNIT RPABC5 FAMILY MEMBER"}, "hamap" {"MF_00250" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit Rpo10 [rpo10]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005653" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, RPB10/RpoN subunit type"}, "pfam" {"PF01194" "RNA polymerases N / 8 kDa subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit RPABC5/Rpb10", "short" "RPABC5/Rpb10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 467, "domain_architectures" 55, "proteomes" 2467, "taxa" 10109, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6902, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6889, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5047}, "pathways" 214}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00856", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00856"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
