{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Dynein is a multisubunit microtubule-dependent motor enzyme that acts as the force generating protein of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. The cytoplasmic isoform of dynein acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules.</p>\n\n<p>Dynein is composed of a number of ATP-binding large subunits (see [interpro:IPR004273]), intermediate size subunits and small subunits. Among the small subunits, there is a family of highly conserved proteins which make up this family [[cite:PUB00002901], [cite:PUB00003701], [cite:PUB00097852]]. Proteins in this family act as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function and may play a role in changing or maintaining the spatial distribution of cytoskeletal structures. In yeast, it was identified as a component of the nuclear pore complex where it may contribute to the stable association of the Nup82 subcomplex with the nuclear pore complex [[cite:PUB00097853]].</p>\n\n<p>Both type 1 (DLC1) and 2 (DLC2) dynein light chains have a similar two-layer α-β core structure consisting of β-α(2)-β-X-β(2) [[cite:PUB00023989], [cite:PUB00037504]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xqq", "name" "Human dynein light chain (DYNLL2) in complex with an in vitro evolved peptide (Ac-SRGTQTE)."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037177", "name" "Dynein light chain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"smart" {"SM01375" "Dynein light chain type 1"}, "panther" {"PTHR11886" "DYNEIN LIGHT CHAIN"}, "pfam" {"PF01221" "Dynein light chain type 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Dynein light chain, type 1/2", "short" "Dynein_light_chain_typ-1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 64, "domain_architectures" 217, "proteomes" 2625, "taxa" 9045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15023, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14774, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9966}, "pathways" 115}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00953", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00953"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001372", :literature {"PUB00002901" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["King SM" "Patel-King RS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
