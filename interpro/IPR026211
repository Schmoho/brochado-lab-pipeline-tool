Mutations in the GIGANTEA (GI) gene delay flowering under long days but the effects are minimal under short days. It is believed that GI plays an important role in regulating the expression of flowering-time genes during the promotion of flowering by photo-period [[cite:PUB00060786]], and that it participates in a feedback loop of the plant circadian system [[cite:PUB00060787]]. In rice, a short day (SD) plant, GI acts as suppressor of flowering under short-day and long-day conditions [[cite:PUB00060223]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GI gene encodes a putative membrane protein containing 6 putative transmembrane (TM) domains [[cite:PUB00060787]]. The protein interacts with SPINDLY, a negative regulator of gibberellin signalling in Arabidopsis, via the latter's N-terminal array of 10 tetratricopeptide repeats [[cite:PUB00060788]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02081" "Protein GIGANTEA"}, "panther" {"PTHR36319" "PROTEIN GIGANTEA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GIGANTEA", "short" "GIGANTEA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 1157, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2077, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1495, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1052}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026211", :literature {"PUB00060788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Tseng TS" "Salome PA" "McClung CR" "Olszewski NE."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.019224", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "SPINDLY and GIGANTEA interact and act in Arabidopsis thaliana pathways involved in light responses, flowering, and rhythms in cotyledon movements.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1550-63", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15155885}, "PUB00060787" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5433", "authors" ["Park DH" "Somers DE" "Kim YS" "Choy YH" "Lim HK" "Soh MS" "Kim HJ" "Kay SA" "Nam HG."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.285.5433.1579", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Control of circadian rhythms and photoperiodic flowering by the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA gene.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1579-82", "volume" "285", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10477524}, "PUB00060786" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Fowler S" "Lee K" "Onouchi H" "Samach A" "Richardson K" "Morris B" "Coupland G" "Putterill J."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/18.17.4679", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "GIGANTEA: a circadian clock-controlled gene that regulates photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis and encodes a protein with several possible membrane-spanning domains.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "4679-88", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10469647}, "PUB00060223" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6933", "authors" ["Hayama R" "Yokoi S" "Tamaki S" "Yano M" "Shimamoto K."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01549", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Adaptation of photoperiodic control pathways produces short-day flowering in rice.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "719-22", "volume" "422", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12700762}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:2000028", "name" "regulation of photoperiodism, flowering", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026211", "name" "GIGANTEA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
