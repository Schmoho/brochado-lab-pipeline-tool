{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Superoxide dismutases (SODs) ([ec:1.15.1.1]) catalyse the conversion of superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen. Their function is to destroy the radicals that are normally produced within cells and are toxic to biological systems. Three evolutionarily distinct families of SODs are known, of which the Mn/Fe-binding family is one [[cite:PUB00001002], [cite:PUB00001553], [cite:PUB00003417]]. This family includes both single metal-binding SODs and cambialistic SOD, which can bind either Mn or Fe.  Fe/MnSODs are ubiquitous enzymes that are responsible for the majority of SOD activity in prokaryotes, fungi, blue-green algae and mitochondria. Fe/MnSODs are found as homodimers or homotetramers.</p>\n\n<p>The structure of Fe/MnSODs can be divided into two domains, an N-terminal domain with an α-fold and α C-terminal domain with an α/β fold, connected by a loop. The structure of the N-terminal domain consists of a two helices in an antiparallel hairpin, with a left-handed twist [[cite:PUB00013976]]. The structure of the C-terminal domain is of the α/β type, and consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet in the order 213, along with four helices in the arrangement α/β2/α/β/α2 [[cite:PUB00013977]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ix9", "name" "Crystal Structure of the E. coli Manganase(III) superoxide dismutase mutant Y174F at 0.90 angstroms resolution."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036324", "name" "Manganese/iron superoxide dismutase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036314", "name" "Manganese/iron superoxide dismutase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000349" "Superoxide dismutase, Mn/Fe specific"}, "prints" {"PR01703" "MNSODISMTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Manganese/iron superoxide dismutase", "short" "Mn/Fe_SOD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 194, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10488, "taxa" 41454, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 72281, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54715, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42260}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00083", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00083"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
