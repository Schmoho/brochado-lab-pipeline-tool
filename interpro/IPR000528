{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Plant cells contain proteins, called non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs) [[cite:PUB00000081], [cite:PUB00000619], [cite:PUB00001487], [cite:PUB00096612]], which transfer phospholipids, glycolipids, fatty acids and sterols from liposomes or microsomes to mitochondria [[cite:PUB00004991]] and are thought to be involved in plant defense. These proteins, expressed throughout the plant tissues but predominantly found in edible parts [[cite:PUB00096612]], could play a major role in membrane biogenesis by conveying phospholipids such as waxes or cutin from their site of biosynthesis to membranes unable to form these lipids. LTPs exist in animal and plant tissues, including rat liver cytosol, potato tuber, castor bean, maize seedlings, spinach, barley and wheat. While there is no sequence similarity between animal and plant LTPs, similarity between the plant proteins is high. Plant LTPs are proteins of about 9 Kd (90 amino acids), containing eight conserved cysteine residues forming 4 disulphide bridges which allow to form a stable, compact barrel-like structure, which is essential for lipid binding [[cite:PUB00096612]]. Plant TLPs are also similar to alpha-amylase inhibitor I2 from the seeds of Indian finger millet and amylase/protease inhibitors from rice and barley.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the proteins in this family are allergens. Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans [WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994)]. This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation.</p>\n\n<p>The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Par j 1 and Par j 2.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fk5", "name" "STRUCTURAL BASIS OF NON-SPECIFIC LIPID BINDING IN MAIZE LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEIN COMPLEXES WITH OLEIC ACID REVEALED BY HIGH-RESOLUTION X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036312", "name" "Bifunctional inhibitor/plant lipid transfer protein/seed storage helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33076" "NON-SPECIFIC LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEIN 2-RELATED"}, "prosite" {"PS00597" "Plant lipid transfer proteins signature"}, "prints" {"PR00382" "LIPIDTRNSFER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Plant non-specific lipid-transfer protein/Par allergen", "short" "Plant_nsLTP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 43, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 250, "taxa" 1277, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20957, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12273, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7472}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00516", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00516"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000528", :literature {"PUB00000081" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Wirtz KW."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
