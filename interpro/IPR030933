{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are related to radical SAM enzymes HemN (oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase) and HutW (a putative heme utilisation enzyme) but lack the signature CxxxCxxC motif for 4Fe-4S binding. Members occur exclusively in Borrelia, which appears to live without iron, as the only radical SAM enzyme homologue in any Borrelia genome.
