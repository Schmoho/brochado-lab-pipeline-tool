{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacterial anti-adapter protein IraD (inhibitor of RssB  after DNA damage) family. It inhibits RpoS proteolysis by regulating RssB activity, thereby increasing the stability of the sigma stress factor RpoS during oxidative stress. Its effect on RpoS stability is due to its interaction with RssB, which probably blocks the interaction of RssB with RpoS, and the consequent delivery of the RssB-RpoS complex to the ClpXP protein degradation pathway which inhibits RpoS  proteolysis by regulating RssB adaptor activity [[cite:PUB00044149]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02010" "Anti-adapter protein IraD [iraD]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-adapter protein, IraD", "short" "Anti-adapt_IraD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 533, "sets" 0, "proteins" 533, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 466}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023776", :literature {"PUB00044149" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Bougdour A" "Cunning C" "Baptiste PJ" "Elliott T" "Gottesman S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
