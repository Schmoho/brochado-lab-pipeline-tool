{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Penicillium brevicompactum bubble protein (BP) and similar proteins. Bubble protein (BP) is a small cysteine-rich protein that is a member of the growing class of defensins, and may act as a toxin [[cite:PUB00031842]]. Studies show that P. brevicompactum BP inhibits growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a dose-dependent manner, thus exhibiting anti-fungal effects [[cite:PUB00103809]]. BP may recognise a molecule or part of a molecule with a negatively charged surface. It is a globular protein consisting of several Î²-strands that are stabilised by disulfide bonds.
