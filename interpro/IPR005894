{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ABC transporters belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily, which uses the hydrolysis of ATP to energise diverse biological systems. ABC transporters minimally consist of two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). These can be found on the same protein or on two different ones. Most ABC transporters function as a dimer and therefore are constituted of four domains, two ABC modules and two TMDs.</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents the daunorubicin resistance ABC transporter ATP binding subunit DrrA, which is found in bacteria and archaea. DrrA is part of the ABC transporter complex DrrABC (composed of two ATP-binding proteins (DrrA) and two transmembrane proteins (DrrB and DrrC)). The DrrABC complex functions as an ATP dependent antiporter and is involved in doxorubicin and daunorubicin efflux [[cite:PUB00062321], [cite:PUB00062322], [cite:PUB00158909]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01188" "daunorubicin resistance ABC transporter, ATP-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Daunorubicin resistance ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit DrrA", "short" "DrrA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2412, "taxa" 9498, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22817, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22817, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17469}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
