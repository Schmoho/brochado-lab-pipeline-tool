{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents of the RepA1 leader peptide known as Tap found in IncFII plasmids. The frequency of replication of IncFII plasmid NR1 during the cell division cycle is regulated by the control of the synthesis of the plasmid-specific replication initiation protein (RepA1). When RepA1 is synthesised, it binds to the plasmid replication origin (ori) and effects the assembly of a replication complex composed of host proteins that mediate the replication of the plasmid [[cite:PUB00016461], [cite:PUB00042990]]. The tap gene encodes a 24-amino acid peptide whose translation is required for the translation of repA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08048" "Tap RepA1 leader peptide"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03475" "RepA leader peptide Tap"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RepA1 leader peptide Tap", "short" "RepA1_leader_peptide_Tap"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 244, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 382, "sets" 0, "proteins" 382, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 297}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012605", :literature {"PUB00016461" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Wu R" "Wang X" "Womble DD" "Rownd RH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
