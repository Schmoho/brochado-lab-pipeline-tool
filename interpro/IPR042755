{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>COP1 is a RING finger-type ubiquitin E3 ligase. In Arabidopsis, it is a central switch for the transition from plant growth underground in darkness (etiolation) to growth under light exposure (photomorphogenesis) [[cite:PUB00089441]]. In mammals, it functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in tumorigenesis, gluconeogenesis, and lipid metabolism. It is regulated by the COP9 signalosome [[cite:PUB00093280]] and is involved in 14-3-3 delta ubiquitin-mediated degradation [[cite:PUB00093281]]. COP1 contains a classic leucine-rich NES and a novel bipartite NLS bridged by a RING finger domain [[cite:PUB00078401]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6qts", "name" "Crystal structure of a mutant Arabidopsis WD40 domain in complex with a photoreceptor"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44080" "E3 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE COP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase COP1", "short" "COP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1252, "taxa" 5076, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3595, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3595, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2267}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
