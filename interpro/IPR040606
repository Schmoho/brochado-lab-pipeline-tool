{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry, previously known as DUF5549, represents the piRNA-mediated silencing protein C19orf84 and related proteins found in mammals. C19orf84  is essential for orchestrating piRNA-directed DNA methylation [[cite:PUB00158929]]. C19orf84 interacts with SPOCD1 and mediates the in vivo association of SPOCD1 with the de novo methylation machinery. DNMT3C, the DNA methyltransferase responsible for transposon methylation, associates with SPOCD1 and C19ORF84 [[cite:PUB00158929]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17703" "Family of unknown function (DUF5549)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "piRNA-mediated silencing protein C19orf84", "short" "C19orf84"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 101, "taxa" 369, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 130, "sets" 0, "proteins" 130, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 81}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040606", :literature {"PUB00158929" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zoch A" "Konieczny G" "Auchynnikava T" "Stallmeyer B" "Rotte N" "Heep M" "Berrens RV" "Schito M" "Kabayama Y" "Schopp T" "Kliesch S" "Houston B" "Nagirnaja L" "O'Bryan MK" "Aston KI" "Conrad DF" "Rappsilber J" "Allshire RC" "Cook AG" "Tuttelmann F" "O'Carroll D."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.01.014", "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "C19ORF84 connects piRNA and DNA methylation machineries to defend the mammalian germ line.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "1021-1035.e11", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38359823}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040606", "name" "piRNA-mediated silencing protein C19orf84", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 106}}}
