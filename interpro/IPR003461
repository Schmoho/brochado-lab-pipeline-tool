{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Keratins are a well known group of intermediate filament proteins. Like actin filaments, keratins are flexible but provide a firm cell skeleton. Unlike actin, however, no known keratins are associated with motor functions. This family represents avian keratin proteins [[cite:PUB00009478]], found in feathers, scale and claw. The avian keratins (F-ker, S-ker, C-ker and B-ker) are a complex mixture of very similar polypeptides.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31203" "BETA-KERATIN-RELATED PROTEIN-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF02422" "Keratin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Keratin", "short" "Keratin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 16, "proteomes" 385, "taxa" 1174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16582, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16431, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14516}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003461", :literature {"PUB00009478" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Gregg K" "Wilton SD" "Parry DA" "Rogers GE."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=6200321&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "A comparison of genomic coding sequences for feather and scale keratins: structural and evolutionary implications.", "year" 1984, "raw_pages" "175-8", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6200321}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005200", "name" "structural constituent of cytoskeleton", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005882", "name" "intermediate filament", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003461", "name" "Keratin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 15411}}}
