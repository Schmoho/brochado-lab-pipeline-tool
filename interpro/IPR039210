It contains a Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase domain and is assumed to be an enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of an organic substrate using a dioxygen molecule.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14650" "PROLYL HYDROXYLASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase domain-containing protein 3", "short" "OGFOD3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 860, "taxa" 3545, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1569, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1569, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1078}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
