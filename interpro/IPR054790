{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes N-acetylmuramate alpha-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (MurU) from beta and gammaproteobacteria. It catalyses the formation of UDP-N-acetylmuramate (UDP-MurNAc), a crucial precursor of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall, from UTP and MurNAc-alpha-1P. It is involved in peptidoglycan recycling as part of a cell wall recycling pathway that bypasses de novo biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-MurNAc [[cite:PUB00154741], [cite:PUB00154742]]. MurU also plays a role in intrinsic resistance to fosfomycin, which targets the de novo synthesis of UDP-MurNAc [[cite:PUB00154741]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4y7u", "name" "Structural analysis of MurU"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF045761" "N-acetylmuramate alpha-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase MurU"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-acetylmuramate alpha-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase", "short" "MurU"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1183, "taxa" 5286, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5925, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5925, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4534}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
