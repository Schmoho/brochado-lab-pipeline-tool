{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Crustacean and cheliceratan hemocyanins (oxygen-transport proteins) and insect hexamerins (storage proteins) are homologous gene products, although the latter do not bind oxygen [[cite:PUB00059233]].</p>\n\n<p>Haemocyanins are found in the haemolymph of many invertebrates. They are divided into 2 main groups, arthropodan and molluscan. These have structurally similar oxygen-binding centres, which are similar to the oxygen-binding centre of tyrosinases, but their quaternary structures are arranged differently. The arthropodan proteins exist as hexamers comprising 3 heterogeneous subunits (a, b and c) and possess 1 oxygen-binding centre per subunit; and the molluscan proteins exist as cylindrical oligomers of 10 to 20 subunits and possess 7 or 8 oxygen-binding centres per subunit [[cite:PUB00000297]]. Although the proteins have similar amino acid compositions, the only real similarity in their primary sequences is in the region corresponding to the second copper-binding domain, which also shows similarity to the copper-binding domain of tyrosinases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6l8s", "name" "High resolution crystal structure of crustacean hemocyanin."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037020", "name" "Hemocyanin, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036697", "name" "Hemocyanin, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11511" "LARVAL STORAGE PROTEIN/PHENOLOXIDASE"}, "prosite" {"PS00210" "Arthropod hemocyanins / insect LSPs signature 2", "PS00209" "Arthropod hemocyanins / insect LSPs signature 1"}, "prints" {"PR00187" "HAEMOCYANIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hemocyanin/hexamerin", "short" "Hemocyanin/hexamerin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 406, "taxa" 3513, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5270, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4882, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3291}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
