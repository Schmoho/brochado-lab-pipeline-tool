{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor protein 1 (PRA1) family includes PRAF1/2/3 from mammals, Yip3 from budding yeasts and several PRA proteins from plants.</p>\n\n<p>In budding yeast, Yip3 interacts with members of the Rab GTPase family and may be involved in transport between the ER and Golgi complex [[cite:PUB00033655]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, PRAF1 is a general Rab protein regulator required for vesicle formation from the Golgi complex. It may control vesicle docking and fusion by mediating the action of Rab GTPases to the SNARE complexes [[cite:PUB00068381]]. It inhibits the removal of Rab GTPases from the membrane by GDI [[cite:PUB00068382]]. PRAF2 plays a pro-apoptotic role in cerulenin-induced neuroblastoma apoptosis [[cite:PUB00068383]]. PRAF3 negatively modulates SLC1A1/EAAC1 glutamate transport activity by decreasing its affinity for glutamate [[cite:PUB00068384]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03208" "PRA1 family protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR19317" "PRENYLATED RAB ACCEPTOR 1-RELATED", "PTHR12859" "PRA1 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prenylated rab acceptor PRA1", "short" "Prenylated_rab_accept_PRA1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 164, "proteomes" 2546, "taxa" 8741, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11424, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11346, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7107}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004895", :literature {"PUB00068381" {"URL" nil, "issue" "39", "authors" ["Gougeon PY" "Prosser DC" "Da-Silva LF" "Ngsee JK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
