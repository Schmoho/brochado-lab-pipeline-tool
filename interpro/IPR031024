{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are LenA (Leptospira Endostatin-like protein A), found in pathogenic and intermediate species of Leptospira but not in saprophytes. LenA binds plasminogen, laminin, and complement regulator factor H. Behavior during outer membrane solubilisation by low concentrations of Triton X-114 and conservation in all family members of an apparent lipoprotein signal sequence, with invariant Cys residue, strongly suggest that LenA is a lipoprotein. Just outside this family is a full-length homologue found in another spirochete, Turneriella parva DSM 21527 [[cite:PUB00074357]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04457" "lipoprotein LenA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipoprotein LenA", "short" "Lipo_LenA_lepto"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 107, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 75, "sets" 0, "proteins" 75, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031024", :literature {"PUB00074357" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Verma A" "Brissette CA" "Bowman AA" "Shah ST" "Zipfel PF" "Stevenson B."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
