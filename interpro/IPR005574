{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb4 and its paralogue, RPC9 (also known as Rpc17 in budding yeasts), a subunit of RNA polymerase III [[cite:PUB00088484]]. The Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits of yeast RNA polymerase II form a heterodimeric complex essential for promoter-directed transcription initiation. The Rpb4-Rpb7 complex is not required for stable recruitment of polymerase to active preinitiation complexes, suggesting that Rpb4-Rpb7 mediates an essential step subsequent to promoter binding [[cite:PUB00007967]]. RPC9 may be involved in the recruitment of pol III by the preinitiation complex [[cite:PUB00056255], [cite:PUB00088483]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1go3", "name" "Structure of an archeal homolog of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II RPB4/RPB7 complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010997", "name" "HRDC-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038324", "name" "Rpb4/RPC9 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03874" "RNA polymerase Rpb4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA polymerase subunit Rpb4/RPC9", "short" "Rpb4/RPC9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 331, "domain_architectures" 138, "proteomes" 2945, "taxa" 11225, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11368, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11338, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7796}, "pathways" 170}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
