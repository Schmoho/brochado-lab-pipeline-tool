{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the cavin family (caveolae-associated proteins; previously known as the PTRF/SDPR family), which includes proteins cavin-1 to 4. They are critical regulators for caveolae dynamics [[cite:PUB00061764]]. Caveolae are invaginations of the plasma membrane involved in many cellular processes, including clathrin-independent endocytosis, cholesterol transport, and signal transduction. Caveolins are the principal components of caveolae membranes. Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF; also known as cavin-1) is essential for formation of caveolae and proper localisation of caveolins [[cite:PUB00061757]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4qkw", "name" "Crystal structure of the zebrafish cavin4a HR1 domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15237" "PTRF/SDPR family"}, "panther" {"PTHR15240" "CAVIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cavin family", "short" "Cavin_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 648, "taxa" 2210, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3250, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3200, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2218}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026752", :literature {"PUB00061760" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Izumi Y" "Hirai S" "Tamai Y" "Fujise-Matsuoka A" "Nishimura Y" "Ohno S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
