{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of peptidases belong to the MEROPS peptidase family M19 (membrane dipeptidase family, clan MJ). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of Klebsiella urease, the type example for clan MJ [[cite:PUB00021853]].</p>\n\n<p>Renal dipeptidase ([ec:3.4.13.19]), also known as microsomal dipeptidase or membrane-bound dipeptidase, is a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme that hydrolyses a wide range of dipeptides. It is involved in renal metabolism of glutathione and its conjugates. It is a homodimeric disulphide-linked glycoprotein attached to the renal brush border microvilli membrane by a GPI-anchor. A glutamate residue has recently been shown [[cite:PUB00021853], [cite:PUB00000644]] to be important for the catalytic activity of renal dipeptidase. Renal dipeptidase seems to be evolutionary related to hypothetical proteins in the PQQ biosynthesis operons of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae [[cite:PUB00003579]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3s2j", "name" "Crystal structure of dipeptidase from Streptomyces coelicolor complexed with phosphinate pseudodipeptide L-Leu-D-Ala"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01301" "rDP_like"}, "profile" {"PS51365" "Renal dipeptidase family profile"}, "pfam" {"PF01244" "Membrane dipeptidase (Peptidase family M19)"}, "panther" {"PTHR10443" "MICROSOMAL DIPEPTIDASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M19", "short" "Pept_M19"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 176, "proteomes" 6775, "taxa" 24914, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 38766, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38671, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28045}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1653", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1653"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
