{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes NS2 proteins from other members of the Orbivirus genus. NS2 is a non-specific single-stranded RNA-binding protein that forms large homomultimers and accumulates in viral inclusion bodies of infected cells. Three RNA-binding regions have been identified in Bluetongue virus 17 ([swissprot:P33473]) at residues 2-11, 153-166 and 274-286 [[cite:PUB00010037]]. NS2 multimers also possess nucleotidyl phosphatase activity [[cite:PUB00010102]]. The precise function of NS2 is not known, but it may be involved in the transport and condensation of viral mRNAs [[cite:PUB00010037]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037194", "name" "NS2, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04514" "Bluetongue virus non-structural protein NS2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bluetongue virus nonstructural protein NS2", "short" "BTV_NS2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 139, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 839, "sets" 0, "proteins" 814, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1006", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1006"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007602", :literature {"PUB00010037" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Fillmore GC" "Lin H" "Li JK."], "ISO_journal" "J.
