{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The portal protein of P22 and similar Podoviridae tail phages is a dodecameric structure consisting of a hip (2), a leg(1) and a barrel(3).  DNA viruses such as bacteriophages and herpesviruses deliver their genome into and out of the capsid through large proteinaceous assemblies, known as portal proteins. Domains 1 and 3 are mostly helical and form the majority of the DNA-translocating channel. Domain 2 adopts an α-β-fold characterised by two sheets of eight β-strands, which cross each other to form a β-barrel-like structure [[cite:PUB00065024]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF16510" "Phage P22-like portal protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phage P22-like portal protein", "short" "P22_portal"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 160, "taxa" 1340, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1451, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1437, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 958}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032427", :literature {"PUB00065024" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Olia AS" "Prevelige PE Jr" "Johnson JE" "Cingolani G."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
