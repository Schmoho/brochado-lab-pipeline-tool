{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Endolytic murein transglycosylase (also known as MltG, YrrL and YceG) functions as a peptidoglycan terminase that cleaves nascent peptidoglycan strands endolytically to terminate their elongation. The structure of E. coli MltG has been solved by X-ray crystallography (PDB: 2r1f). It has an extended N terminus topped by a globular head domain with an observable cleft where residues with the highest level of conservation are found [[cite:PUB00080717]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caution: This protein is often misannotated as aminodeoxychorismate lyase (PabC) due to the promiximty to PabC in numerous proteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08010" "proteins similar to Escherichia coli YceG/mltG may function as endolytic murein transglycosylases"}, "hamap" {"MF_02065" "Endolytic murein transglycosylase [mltG]"}, "panther" {"PTHR30518" "ENDOLYTIC MUREIN TRANSGLYCOSYLASE"}, "pfam" {"PF02618" "YceG-like family"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00247" "endolytic transglycosylase MltG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Endolytic murein transglycosylase", "short" "MLTG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 66, "proteomes" 8484, "taxa" 33433, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 42506, "sets" 0, "proteins" 42391, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32214}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
