{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA replication in eukaryotes results from a highly coordinated interaction between proteins, often as part of protein complexes, and the DNA template. One of the key early steps leading to DNA replication is formation of the pre-replication complex, or pre-RC. The pre-RC is formed by the sequential binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins, and the MCM complex. Activation of the pre-RC into the initiation complex (IC) is achieved via the action of S-phase kinases, eventually leading to the loading of the replication machinery.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, a novel replication complex, GINS (for Go, Ichi, Nii, and San; five, one, two, and three in Japanese), has been identified [[cite:PUB00012381], [cite:PUB00015004]]. \n\nThe precise function of GINS is not known. However, genetic and two-hybrid interactions indicate that it mediates the loading of the enzymatic replication machinery at a step after the action of the S-phase kinases [[cite:PUB00015004]]. Furthermore, GINS may be a part of the replication machinery itself, since it is found associated with replicating DNA [[cite:PUB00012381], [cite:PUB00015004]]. Electron microscopy of GINS shows that it forms a ring-like structure [[cite:PUB00012381]], reminiscent of the structure of PCNA [[cite:PUB00015005]], the DNA polymerase delta replication clamp. This observation, coupled with the observed interactions for GINS, indicates that the complex may represent the replication clamp for DNA polymerase epsilon [[cite:PUB00012381]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The GINS complex is essential for initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts [[cite:PUB00012381]].
