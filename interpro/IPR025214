All active centromeres are characterised by the presence of long arrays of nucleosomes in which CENP-A replaces histone H3. CENP-A assembles an array of nucleosomes and it is this that seems to be the prime candidate for specifying centromere identity. CENP-A nucleosomes directly recruit a proximal CENP-A nucleosome associated complex (NAC) comprised of CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T, CENP-U(50), CENP-C and CENP-H. Assembly of the CENP-A NAC at centromeres is dependent on CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T. Additionally, there are seven other subunits which make up the CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere, CENP-K, CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S, also assembling on the CENP-A NAC [[cite:PUB00044194]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13097" "CENP-A nucleosome associated complex (NAC) subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Centromere protein U", "short" "CENP-U"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 604, "taxa" 2163, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 959, "sets" 0, "proteins" 955, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 631}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025214", :literature {"PUB00044194" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Foltz DR" "Jansen LE" "Black BE" "Bailey AO" "Yates JR 3rd" "Cleveland DW."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
