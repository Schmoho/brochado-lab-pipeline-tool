{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of enzymes belongs to the GHMP kinase domain superfamily. GHMP kinases are a unique class of ATP-dependent enzymes (the abbreviation of which refers to the original members: galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) [[cite:PUB00015675]]. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily contain three well-conserved motifs, the second of which has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala and is involved in ATP binding [[cite:PUB00015644]]. The phosphate binding loop in GHMP kinases is distinct from the classical P-loops found in many ATP/GTP binding proteins. The bound ADP molecule adopts a rare syn conformation and is in the opposite orientation from those bound to the P-loop-containing proteins [[cite:PUB00015644]]. GHMP kinases display a distinctly bilobal appearance with their N-terminal subdomains dominated by a mixed β-sheet flanked on one side by α-helices and their C-terminal subdomains containing a four stranded anti-parallel β-sheet [[cite:PUB00015835], [cite:PUB00015644], [cite:PUB00015669], [cite:PUB00015730]].</p>\n\n<p>Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus protein has been characterised as a D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate kinase that adds phosphate group to C-1 of D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate [[cite:PUB00016208]], and has been called GmhB or HddA. Note that HddA is the preferred name for this protein because the name GmhB has also been used for the D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase, [pirsf:PIRSF004682] [[cite:PUB00015918], [cite:PUB00015950]]. This enzyme catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated form GDP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose [[cite:PUB00016208]] and is encoded by the heptose operon [[cite:PUB00016208]].</p>\n\n<p>D-glycero-D-manno-heptose is a constituent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cores of Gram-negative bacteria, and also a component of the S-layer glycoprotein of the Gram-positive bacterium Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus. The principal architecture of S-layer glycoproteins resembles that of the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and comparable pathways are used for the biosynthesis of these similar glycoconjugates [[cite:PUB00016208]].</p>\n\n<p>WcbL of Burkholderia pseudomallei is also involved in the synthesis of an LPS (type I O-polysaccharide moieties) [[cite:PUB00015917]].</p>\n\n<p>LmbP is thought to belong to the lincomycin-production gene cluster of Streptomyces lincolnensis [[cite:PUB00003870]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4usk", "name" "Unravelling the B. pseudomallei heptokinase WcbL: from Structure to Drug Discovery."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR020568", "name" "Ribosomal protein uS5 domain 2-type superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036406" "D,D-heptose 7-phosphate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "D,D-heptose 7-phosphate kinase", "short" "Heptose_7-P_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 645, "taxa" 4660, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5185, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5154, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3863}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
