{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p><i>Escherichia coli</i> RimK (also known as Ribosomal protein bS6-L-glutamate ligase) adds additional Glu residues to the native Glu-Glu C terminus of ribosomal protein bS6. Mutation of the Glu-Glu terminus to Lys-Glu blocked addition. Ribosomal protein bS6 has the C-terminal sequence Glu-Glu in few species, suggesting the homologue of RimK may have a function other than bS6 modification in those species. However, most species having a member of this protein subfamily do not have an bS6 homologue ending in Glu-Glu.
