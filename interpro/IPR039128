{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Activating signal cointegrator 1 (TRIP4) is a transcription coactivator that interacts with nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptor [[cite:PUB00071531]], the androgen receptor [[cite:PUB00088960]] and ESR1 [[cite:PUB00071531]], provided ligand is bound to the receptor.  This interaction facilitates nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. TRIP4 contains a C4-type zinc finger. It is polyufmylated by the UFM1-conjugating system and deufmylated by the protease UFSP2; ufmylation promotes the recruitment of additional transcriptional coactivators [[cite:PUB00088961]]. TRIP4 also functions as part of the RQC trigger (RQT) complex that activates the ribosome quality control (RQC) pathway, a pathway that degrades nascent peptide chains during problematic translation [[cite:PUB00151150], [cite:PUB00151151], [cite:PUB00151152]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes TRIP4 orthologues from yeast, RQT4, which is part of the RQC trigger (RQT) complex that activates the ribosome quality control (RQC) pathway, a pathway that degrades nascent peptide chains during problematic translation [[cite:PUB00099554]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8yfj", "name" "TRIP4 ASCH domain in complex with a 12bp dsDNA (5'-ATTGGATCCAAT-3')"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12963" "THYROID RECEPTOR INTERACTING PROTEIN RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Activating signal cointegrator 1-like", "short" "TRIP4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2237, "taxa" 7786, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4510, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4510, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2939}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039128", :literature {"PUB00151152" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Narita M" "Denk T" "Matsuo Y" "Sugiyama T" "Kikuguchi C" "Ito S" "Sato N" "Suzuki T" "Hashimoto S" "Machova I" "Tesina P" "Beckmann R" "Inada T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "A distinct mammalian disome collision interface harbors K63-linked polyubiquitination of uS10 to trigger hRQT-mediated subunit dissociation.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "6411", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36302773}, "PUB00151150" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hashimoto S" "Sugiyama T" "Yamazaki R" "Nobuta R" "Inada T."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Identification of a novel trigger complex that facilitates ribosome-associated quality control in mammalian cells.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "3422", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32099016}, "PUB00151151" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Juszkiewicz S" "Speldewinde SH" "Wan L" "Svejstrup JQ" "Hegde RS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "The ASC-1 Complex Disassembles Collided Ribosomes.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "603-614.e8", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32579943}, "PUB00099554" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Matsuo Y" "Tesina P" "Nakajima S" "Mizuno M" "Endo A" "Buschauer R" "Cheng J" "Shounai O" "Ikeuchi K" "Saeki Y" "Becker T" "Beckmann R" "Inada T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Struct Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nat Struct Mol Biol", "title" "RQT complex dissociates ribosomes collided on endogenous RQC substrate SDD1.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "323-332", "volume" "27", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32203490}, "PUB00071531" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Kim HJ" "Yi JY" "Sung HS" "Moore DD" "Jhun BH" "Lee YC" "Lee JW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
