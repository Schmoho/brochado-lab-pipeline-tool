{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Citrate synthase [ec:2.3.3.1] is a member of a small family of enzymes that can directly form a carbon-carbon bond without the presence of metal ion cofactors. It catalyses the first reaction in the Krebs' cycle, namely the conversion of oxaloacetate and acetyl-coenzyme A into citrate and coenzyme A. This reaction is important for energy generation and for carbon assimilation. The reaction proceeds via a non-covalently bound citryl-coenzyme A intermediate in a 2-step process (aldol-Claisen condensation followed by the hydrolysis of citryl-CoA).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents types I and II citrate synthase enzymes, as well as the related enzymes 2-methylcitrate synthase and ATP citrate synthase. 2-methylcitrate ([ec:2.3.3.5]) synthase catalyses the conversion of oxaloacetate and propanoyl-CoA into (2R,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate and coenzyme A. This enzyme is induced during bacterial and fungal growth on propionate [[cite:PUB00094532], [cite:PUB00090961]], while type II hexameric citrate synthase is constitutive [[cite:PUB00013490]]. ATP citrate synthase ([ec:2.3.3.8]) (also known as ATP citrate lyase) catalyses the MgATP-dependent, CoA-dependent cleavage of citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, a key step in the reductive tricarboxylic acid pathway of CO2 assimilation used by a variety of autotrophic bacteria and archaea to fix carbon dioxide [[cite:PUB00042606]]. ATP citrate synthase is composed of two distinct subunits. In eukaryotes, ATP citrate synthase is a homotetramer of a single large polypeptide, and is used to produce cytosolic acetyl-CoA from mitochondrial produced citrate [[cite:PUB00042607]]. This entry includes citrate synthase from Thermosulfidibacter takaii, which catalyses both citrate generation and citrate cleavage as it is part of a reversible tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that can fix carbon dioxide autotrophically and may represent an ancestral mode of the conventional reductive TCA (rTCA) cycle [[cite:PUB00094533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5tde", "name" "TEV Cleaved Human ATP Citrate Lyase Bound to Citrate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036969", "name" "Citrate synthase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016143", "name" "Citrate synthase-like, small alpha subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016142", "name" "Citrate synthase-like, large alpha subdomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11739" "CITRATE SYNTHASE", "PTHR23118" "ATP-CITRATE SYNTHASE"}, "prints" {"PR00143" "CITRTSNTHASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00285" "Citrate synthase, C-terminal domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Citrate synthase", "short" "Citrate_synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 138, "domain_architectures" 286, "proteomes" 11061, "taxa" 43471, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 90998, "sets" 0, "proteins" 89511, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 68045}, "pathways" 59}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00422", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00422"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1265", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1265"} {"accession" "GenProp1693", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1693"} {"accession" "GenProp1687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1687"} {"accession" "GenProp1267", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1267"} {"accession" "GenProp1710", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1710"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
