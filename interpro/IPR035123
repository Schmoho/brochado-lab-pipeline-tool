{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains members such as UL16 found in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). It is an immunoevasin which subverts NKG2D-mediated immune responses by retaining a select group of diverse NKG2D ligands inside the cell. UL16 is a heavily glycosylated 50kDa type I trans-membrane glycoprotein. The ectodomain folds into a modified version of the a variable (V-type) (immunoglobulin Ig)-like domain. The N-terminal 'plug' region (amino acids 27-50) is covalently linked to the Ig-like core with a disulfide bond. UL16 protein utilizes a three-stranded β-sheet to engage the α-helical surface of the MHC class I-like MICB platform domain. Residues at the centre of this β-sheet mimic a central binding motif employed by the structurally unrelated C-type lectin-like NKG2D to facilitate engagement of diverse NKG2D ligands [[cite:PUB00085206]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wy3", "name" "Structure of the HCMV UL16-MICB complex elucidates select binding of a viral immunoevasin to diverse NKG2D ligands"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038671", "name" "Human cytomegalovirus, UL16 ectodomain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17622" "Viral unique long protein 16"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Viral unique long protein 16", "short" "UL16"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 18, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035123", :literature {"PUB00085206" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Muller S" "Zocher G" "Steinle A" "Stehle T."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000723", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Structure of the HCMV UL16-MICB complex elucidates select binding of a viral immunoevasin to diverse NKG2D ligands.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "e1000723", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20090832}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035123", "name" "Viral unique long protein 16", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 3}}}
