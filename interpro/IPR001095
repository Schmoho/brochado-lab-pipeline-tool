{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains the alpha subunit (Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyl transferase ACCA [ec:2.1.3.15]) of the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase complex ([ec:6.4.1.2]). ACCA catalyses the transfer of a carboxyl group carried on a biotinylated biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) to acetyl-CoA, forming malonyl-CoA,  the first step in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex is a heterohexamer of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase and two non-identical carboxyl transferase subunits (alpha and beta) in a 2:2 association [[cite:PUB00002735]]. The reaction involves two steps:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>\nBiotin carrier protein + ATP + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>->Carboxybiotin carrier protein + ADP + P<sub>i</sub>\n</reaction></p>\n\n<p><reaction>\nCarboxybiotin carrier protein + Acetyl-CoA ->Malonyl-CoA + Biotin carrier protein\n</reaction></p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2f9i", "name" "Crystal Structure of the carboxyltransferase subunit of ACC from Staphylococcus aureus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029045", "name" "ClpP/crotonase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041504" "carboxyltransferase subunit alpha", "TIGR00513" "acetyl-CoA carboxylase carboxyl transferase subunit alpha"}, "panther" {"PTHR42853" "ACETYL-COENZYME A CARBOXYLASE CARBOXYL TRANSFERASE SUBUNIT ALPHA"}, "hamap" {"MF_00823" "Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyl transferase subunit alpha [accA]"}, "pfam" {"PF03255" "Acetyl co-enzyme A carboxylase carboxyltransferase-like"}, "prints" {"PR01069" "ACCCTRFRASEA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, alpha subunit", "short" "Acetyl_CoA_COase_a_su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 81, "proteomes" 7220, "taxa" 28814, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33501, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25287}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0214", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0214"} {"accession" "GenProp1111", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1111"} {"accession" "GenProp1512", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1512"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
