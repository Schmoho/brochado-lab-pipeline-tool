{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>By homology, members of this family are Zn metallohydrolases in the same family as the SoxH protein associated with sulfate metabolism, Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase II (see PDB:1bc2), and, more distantly, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (glyoxalase II). All members occur in genomes with both PQQ biosynthesis and a PQQ-dependent (quinoprotein) dehydrogenase that has a motif of two consecutive Cys residues ([interpro:IPR017512]). The Cys-Cys motif is associated with electron transfer by specialised cytochromes such as c551. All these genomes also include a fusion protein ([interpro:IPR030831]) whose domains resemble SoxY and SoxZ from thiosulfate oxidation. A conserved Cys in this fusion protein aligns to the Cys residue in SoxY that carries sulfur cycle intermediates. In many genomes, the genes for PQQ biosynthesis enzymes, PQQ-dependent enzymes, their associated cytochromes, and members of this family are clustered. Note that one to three closely related Zn metallohydrolases may occur; this family represents a specific clade among them.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04558" "quinoprotein relay system zinc metallohydrolase 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Quinoprotein relay system zinc metallohydrolase 1", "short" "SoxH-rel_PQQ_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 232, "taxa" 1131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 987, "sets" 0, "proteins" 987, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 774}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1101", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1101"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030811", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR050855", "name" "Metallo-beta-lactamase type 2-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR030811", "name" "Quinoprotein relay system zinc metallohydrolase 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
