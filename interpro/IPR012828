{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>6-phosphofructokinase ([ec:2.7.1.11]), a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the addition of phosphate from ATP to fructose 6-phosphate to give fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

[interpro:IPR012829] contains members that are ATP-dependent as well as members that are pyrophosphate-dependent.
