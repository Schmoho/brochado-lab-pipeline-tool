{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a proteobacterial histidine utilization repressor. It is usually found clustered with the enzymes HutUHIG so that it can regulate its own expression as well. A number of species have several paralogs and may fine-tune the regulation according to levels of degradation intermediates such as urocanate. This family belongs to the larger GntR family of transcriptional regulators.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028978", "name" "Chorismate pyruvate-lyase/UbiC transcription regulator-associated domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02018" "histidine utilization repressor"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine utilization repressor", "short" "His_ut_repres"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1106, "taxa" 6040, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7657, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7657, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6045}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010248", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006547", "name" "L-histidine metabolic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045892", "name" "negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010248", "name" "Histidine utilization repressor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
