{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes plant homologues of Kinetochore protein NDC80, mainly found in clade Streptophyta. NDC80 is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division [[cite:PUB00097609], [cite:PUB00155365]]. Members of this family are involved in the formation of the kinetochore, a critical structure that attaches chromosomes to the spindle microtubules. They play a key role in the spindle checkpoint, ensuring that chromosomes are properly aligned and segregated to prevent aneuploidy and maintain genomic stability.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46681" "KINETOCHORE PROTEIN NDC80 HOMOLOG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kinetochore protein NDC80 homolog, plants", "short" "NDC80_plants"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 230, "taxa" 874, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 770, "sets" 0, "proteins" 770, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 457}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055307", :literature {"PUB00155365" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Li J" "Wang Y" "Zou W" "Jian L" "Fu Y" "Zhao J."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.15347", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "AtNUF2 modulates spindle microtubule organization and chromosome segregation during mitosis.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "801-816", "volume" "107", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33993566}, "PUB00097609" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Shin J" "Jeong G" "Park JY" "Kim H" "Lee I."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "MUN (MERISTEM UNSTRUCTURED), encoding a SPC24 homolog of NDC80 kinetochore complex, affects development through cell division in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "977-991", "volume" "93", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29356153}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055307", "name" "Kinetochore protein NDC80 homolog, plants", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
