{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The fungal ribotoxins are a family of highly specific ribonucleases that inactivate the ribosome by cleavage of the 23-28S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit at a single phosphodiester bond. Cleavage abolishes the capacity of ribosomes to carry out protein synthesis by inhibiting elongation factor 1- dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP-dependent binding of elongation factor 2 to ribosomes. Mitogillin-like ribotoxins are among the most potent inhibitors of translation so far identified, and they have been investigated as potential anti-tumour agents, or components of immunotoxins [[cite:PUB00018906]]. Members of this family include ribonuclease mitogillin, ribonuclease alpha-sarcin and ribonuclease clavin precursor proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1aqz", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF A HIGHLY SPECIFIC ASPERGILLUS RIBOTOXIN, RESTRICTOCIN"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016191", "name" "Ribonuclease/ribotoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01704" "FUNRIBOTOXIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fungal ribotoxin", "short" "Fun_ribotoxin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 15, "taxa" 68, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 258, "sets" 0, "proteins" 54, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
