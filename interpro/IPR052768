{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing and plays a role in apoptotic cell death. Members of this family  includes RNA-binding protein 25 (RBM25) from human and its orthologue from S.pombe U1 snRNP-associated protein usp107. RBM25 modulates the expression of the apoptotic factor BCL2L1 by influencing the ratio of its isoforms. They are capable of binding to specific RNA sequences, which promotes the selection of certain splice sites, affecting the generation of different mRNA isoforms [[cite:PUB00083044]]. It is also involved in the generation of an abnormal and truncated splice form of SCN5A in heart failure [[cite:PUB00083045]]. S. pombe usp107 is a component of the U1 snRNP particle and may contribute to the recognition and binding of pre-mRNA 5'-splice sites [[cite:PUB00083052]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18806" "RBM25 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-binding protein 25", "short" "RBM25"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2205, "taxa" 7381, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4490, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4490, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2921}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR052768", :literature {"PUB00083044" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Zhou A" "Ou AC" "Cho A" "Benz EJ Jr" "Huang SC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
