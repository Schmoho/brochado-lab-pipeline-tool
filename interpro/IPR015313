{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Her-1 adopts an all-helical structure with two subdomains: residues 19-80 comprise a left-handed three-helix bundle with an overhand connection between the second and third helices, whilst residues 81-164 comprise a left-handed anti-parallel four-helix bundle in which the first helix consists of four consecutive turns of 3-10-helix. Fourteen Cys residues are conserved in all known HER-1 sequences and form seven disulphide bonds. The protein dictates male development in Caenorhabditis elegans, probably by playing a direct role in cell signalling during C. elegans sex determination. It also inhibits the function of tra-2a [[cite:PUB00035367]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1szh", "name" "Crystal Structure of C. elegans HER-1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043108", "name" "Her-1, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036341", "name" "Her-1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37979" "PROTEIN HER-1"}, "pfam" {"PF09232" "Caenorhabditis elegans Her-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein Her-1", "short" "Her-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 57, "taxa" 215, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 119, "sets" 0, "proteins" 118, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 76}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015313", :literature {"PUB00035367" {"URL" nil, "issue" "32", "authors" ["Hamaoka BY" "Dann CE 3rd" "Geisbrecht BV" "Leahy DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
