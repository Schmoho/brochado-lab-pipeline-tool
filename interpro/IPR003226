{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes MYG1 exonuclease from human and its orthologues, a 3'-5' RNA exonuclease which cleaves in situ on specific transcripts in both nucleus and mitochondrion. It is involved in regulating spatially segregated organellar RNA processing, acting as a coordinator of nucleo-mitochondrial crosstalk [[cite:PUB00155300]]. In nucleolus, processes pre-ribosomal RNA involved in ribosome assembly and alters cytoplasmic translation. In mitochondrial matrix, processes 3'-termini of the mito-ribosomal and messenger RNAs and controls translation of mitochondrial proteins [[cite:PUB00155300]]. Overexpression of MYG1 has been associated with the autoimmune disorder vitiligo, suggesting that MYG1 may play some role in human innate immunity [[cite:PUB00155301]]. Studies in yeast suggested a potential antiviral function of MYG1 [[cite:PUB00155302]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03690" "Uncharacterised protein family (UPF0160)"}, "panther" {"PTHR11215" "METAL DEPENDENT HYDROLASE - RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MYG1 exonuclease", "short" "MYG1_exonuclease"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 90, "proteomes" 3134, "taxa" 11398, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7197, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5014}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003226", :literature {"PUB00155300" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Grover R" "Burse SA" "Shankrit S" "Aggarwal A" "Kirty K" "Narta K" "Srivastav R" "Ray AK" "Malik G" "Vats A" "Motiani RK" "Thukral L" "Roy SS" "Bhattacharya S" "Sharma R" "Natarajan K" "Mukerji M" "Pandey R" "Gokhale RS" "Natarajan VT."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz371", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Myg1 exonuclease couples the nuclear and mitochondrial translational programs through RNA processing.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "5852-5866", "volume" "47", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31081026}, "PUB00155302" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Chau S" "Gao J" "Diao AJ" "Cao SB" "Azhieh A" "Davidson AR" "Meneghini MD."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2208695120", "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Diverse yeast antiviral systems prevent lethal pathogenesis caused by the L-A mycovirus.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "e2208695120", "volume" "120", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36888656}, "PUB00155301" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Dwivedi M" "Laddha NC" "Begum R."], "ISO_journal" "J Dermatol Sci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2013.04.026", "medline_journal" "J Dermatol Sci", "title" "Correlation of increased MYG1 expression and its promoter polymorphism with disease progression and higher susceptibility in vitiligo patients.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "195-202", "volume" "71", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23706493}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003226", "name" "MYG1 exonuclease", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 169, "alignment:full" 3560}}}
