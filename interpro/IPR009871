{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Babuvirus proteins of around 120 residues in length. Proteins in this family include movement and RNA silencing protein (also known as MP) from Banana bunchy top virus. MP acts as a suppressor of RNA-mediated gene silencing, also known as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), a mechanism of plant viral defense that limits the accumulation of viral RNAs. It transports viral genome to neighbouring plant cells directly through plasmosdesmata, without any budding. The movement protein allows efficient cell to cell propagation, by bypassing the host cell wall barrier [[cite:PUB00070087]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07234" "Movement and RNA silencing protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Movement and RNA silencing protein", "short" "MP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 14, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 213, "sets" 0, "proteins" 213, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009871", :literature {"PUB00070087" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Niu S" "Wang B" "Guo X" "Yu J" "Wang X" "Xu K" "Zhai Y" "Wang J" "Liu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
