{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are integrases associated with integrons (and super-integrons), which are systems for incorporating and expressing cassettes of laterally transferred DNA. Incorporation occurs at an attI site. A super-integron, as in Vibrio species, may include over 100 cassettes. This family belongs to the phage integrase family that also includes recombinases XerC ([interpro:IPR011931]) and XerD ([interpro:IPR011932]), which are bacterial housekeeping proteins. Within this family of integron integrases, some are designated by class, e.g. IntI4, a class 4 integron integrase from Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar eltor str.
