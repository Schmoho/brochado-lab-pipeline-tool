{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TBC1 domain family member 23 (TBC1D23) is a catalytically inactive member of a family of Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) which plays a role in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking and is important for normal brain development, especially in axonal and dendritic growth. It functions as a bridging factor between golgin-97/245 and the FAM21 subunit of the WASH (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue) complex on endosomal vesicles [[cite:PUB00090056]]. Mutations of the TBC1D23 gene cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and alter cortical development [[cite:PUB00090057]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6jm5", "name" "Crystal structure of TBC1D23 C terminal domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13297" "TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY MEMBER 23-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TBC1 domain family member 23", "short" "TBC1D23"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1081, "taxa" 4395, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2958, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2958, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1870}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039755", :literature {"PUB00090056" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Shin JJH" "Gillingham AK" "Begum F" "Chadwick J" "Munro S."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
