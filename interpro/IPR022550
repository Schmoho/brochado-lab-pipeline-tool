{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of bacterial proteins that have a nucleotidyltransferase fold. The fold-prediction is backed up by conservation of three highly characteristic sequence motifs found in all other nucleotidyl transferases: i) pDhDhhh(h/p), where p is a polar residue and h is a hydrophobic residue; ii) upstream of the first, a GG/S; iii) a conserved D/E in a hydrophobic surround. In the classification of nucleotidyltransferases proposed in [[cite:PUB00066751]] this is a group XVIII NTP-transferase. Many of these sequences were classified in the COG database as COG5397. The exact function is not known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12281" "Nucleotidyltransferase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF031854" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP031854 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nucleotidyltransferase 8", "short" "NTP_transf_8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 482, "taxa" 2733, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2451, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2446, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1867}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022550", :literature {"PUB00066751" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Kuchta K" "Knizewski L" "Wyrwicz LS" "Rychlewski L" "Ginalski K."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp854", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Comprehensive classification of nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins: identification of novel families and their representatives in human.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "7701-14", "volume" "37", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19833706}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022550", "name" "Nucleotidyltransferase 8", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 24, "alignment:full" 564}}}
