{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems (I and II) located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae. Photosystem II (PSII) has a P680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll 'a' that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation (splitting) of water molecules, and to produce ATP via a proton pump. Photosystem I (PSI) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated hydrogen donated from PSII to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by PSII, releasing oxygen as a by-product [[cite:PUB00152828]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents subunit VIII (PsaI) of the photosystem I (PSI) reaction centre. PSI is located, along with photosystem II (PSII), in the thylakoid photosynthetic membranes of plants, green algae and cyanobacteria. The crystal structure of PSI from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (Thermosynechococcus elongatus) has 12 protein subunits and 127 cofactors comprising 96 chlorophylls, 2 phylloquinones, 3 4Fe4S clusters, 22 carotenoids, 4 lipids, and a putative calcium ion [[cite:PUB00015098]]. PsaI consists of a single transmembrane helix, and has a crucial role in aiding normal structural organisation of PsaL within the PSI complex and the absence of PsaI alters PsaL organisation, leading to a small, but physiologically significant, defect in PSI function [[cite:PUB00006328]]. PsaL encodes a subunit of PSI and is necessary for trimerisation of PSI. PsaL may constitute the trimer-forming domain in the structure of PSI [[cite:PUB00006297]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7fix", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of cyanobacterial photosystem I in the presence of ferredoxin and cytochrome c6"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036357", "name" "Photosystem I reaction centre subunit VIII superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35775" "PTHR35775"}, "hamap" {"MF_00431" "Photosystem I reaction center subunit VIII [psaI]"}, "pfam" {"PF00796" "Photosystem I reaction centre subunit VIII"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03052" "photosystem I reaction center subunit VIII"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem I reaction centre subunit VIII", "short" "PSI_PsaI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 111, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 274, "taxa" 20818, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13912, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11219}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1353", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1353"} {"accession" "GenProp0660", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0660"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001302", :literature {"PUB00006328" {"URL" nil, "issue" "27", "authors" ["Xu Q" "Hoppe D" "Chitnis VP" "Odom WR" "Guikema JA" "Chitnis PR."], "ISO_journal" "J.
