{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL) mainly from bacteria [[cite:PUB00042403]].

It also catalyses the conversion of 2-amino-2'-deoxyadenylo-succinate to dZMP and fumarate, when the bacterium is infected by a phage that produces the substrate of this reaction, a step in the synthesis of dZTP (2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate), which is a nucleotide then used by the phage as a DNA polymerase substrate [[cite:PUB00100538]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7t24", "name" "Crystal Structure of Adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008948", "name" "L-Aspartase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43411" "ADENYLOSUCCINATE LYASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenylosuccinate lyase PurB, bacteria", "short" "PurB_bact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3960, "taxa" 16400, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18179, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18179, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13895}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
