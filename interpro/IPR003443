{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has a variety of biological functions, including stimulation and maintenance of cellular immune responses [[cite:PUB00019742]]. It is required for division of CD8+ T cells of memory phenotype, a process that is increased by inhibition of IL-2 [[cite:PUB00046028]]. The numbers of CD8+ memory T cells in animals may, therefore, be controlled by a balance between IL-15 and -2.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the interleukin-15 and interleukin-21 family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2z3q", "name" "Crystal structure of the IL-15/IL-15Ra complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02372" "Interleukin 15"}, "panther" {"PTHR14356" "INTERLEUKIN-15-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-15/Interleukin-21 family", "short" "IL-15/IL-21_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 609, "taxa" 2102, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1900, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1895, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1349}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003443", :literature {"PUB00046028" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5466", "authors" ["Ku CC" "Murakami M" "Sakamoto A" "Kappler J" "Marrack P."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.288.5466.675", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Control of homeostasis of CD8+ memory T cells by opposing cytokines.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "675-8", "volume" "288", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10784451}, "PUB00019742" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Liu CC" "Perussia B" "Young JD."], "ISO_journal" "Immunol.
