{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and PGC-1 beta are two members of the PGC-1 family and important regulators of mitochondrial metabolism. They are expressed at high levels in heart and skeletal muscle and can induce mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity. PGC-1 alpha and PGC-1 beta regulate DNA-binding transcription factors, such as estrogen-related receptors (ERRS).

Perm1 does not function as a classical coactivator, but has been suggested to act by regulating signalling pathways in a tissue-selective manner to enable PGC-1/ERRs to induce specific sets of genes. It has been shown that Perm1 is also required for the efficient expression of the glucose transporter Glut4, thus, it may affect glucose uptake, and of the mitochondrial creatine kinase Ckmt2 [[cite:PUB00094028]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47282" "PGC-1 AND ERR-INDUCED REGULATOR IN MUSCLE PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PGC-1 and ERR-induced regulator in muscle protein 1", "short" "Perm1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 528, "taxa" 1875, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 914, "sets" 0, "proteins" 914, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 546}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR043442", :literature {"PUB00094028" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Cho Y" "Hazen BC" "Russell AP" "Kralli A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
