{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Developmentally regulated G-proteins (DRGs) are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding proteins found in archaea, plants, fungi and animals, indicating important roles in fundamental pathways. DRG is a member of the Obg family, an evolutionary branch of GTPase superfamily proteins. GTPases act as molecular switches regulating diverse cellular processes. DRG2 and DRG1 comprise the DRG subfamily in eukaryotes. It has been proposed that the DRG subfamily proteins play their physiological roles through RNA binding [[cite:PUB00074840]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01896" "Developmentally Regulated GTP-binding protein (DRG)"}, "panther" {"PTHR43127" "DEVELOPMENTALLY-REGULATED GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein", "short" "DRG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3090, "taxa" 12499, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14282, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14204, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10024}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
