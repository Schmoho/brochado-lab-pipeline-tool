{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Oxoprolinase family consists of oxoprolinase, hydantoinase A (HyuA) and hydantoinase B (HyuB).</p>\n\n<p>Hydantoinase A (HyuA) and oxoprolinase ([ec:3.5.2.9]) catalyse reactions involving the hydrolysis of 5-membered rings via hydrolysis of their internal imide bonds [[cite:PUB00005769]]. This entry also includes (4-{4-[2-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)ethyl]phenoxymethyl}furan-2-yl)methanamine synthase from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, which is involved in methanofuran biosynthesis, catalysing the condensation between 5-(aminomethyl)-3-furanmethanol diphosphate and gamma-glutamyltyramine to produce 4-[N-(gamma-L-glutamyl)-p-(beta-aminoethyl)phenoxymethyl]-(aminomethyl)furan (APMF-Glu) [[cite:PUB00077118]]. D-5-(2-methylthioethyl)hydantoin amidohydrolase (HyuA) from Pseudomonas is a component of the hydantoinase process, an enzymatic cascade converting D-5-(2-methylthioethyl)hydantoin to N-carbamoyl-D-methionine [[cite:PUB00019732]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes ccetone carboxylase beta subunit and acetophenone carboxylase alpha/delta/gamma subunits. Caprolactamase subunits alpha and beta are also included in this entry, which are components of a caprolactamase involved in the degradation of caprolactam, an industrial compound mainly used in the production of Nylon 6 [[cite:PUB00155113], [cite:PUB00155114]]. They catalyse the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of the caprolactam ring to form 6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA) [[cite:PUB00155113], [cite:PUB00155114]]. The alpha subunit is responsible for ATP-dependent substrate phosphorylation, while the beta subunit is responsible for hydrolytic lactam ring opening [[cite:PUB00155114]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5m45", "name" "Structure of Acetone Carboxylase purified from Xanthobacter autotrophicus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11365" "5-OXOPROLINASE RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oxoprolinase-like", "short" "Oxoprolinase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6259, "taxa" 23809, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 69586, "sets" 0, "proteins" 69586, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47304}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
