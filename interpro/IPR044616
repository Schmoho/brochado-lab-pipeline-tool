EFO2 acts as a floral repressor, while EFO1 may not be directly involved in flowering, however, they have overlapping roles in regulating other developmental processes. Moreover,  both EFO1/2 genes are regulated by the circadian clock [[cite:PUB00096543]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8gqe", "name" "Crystal structure of the W285A mutant of UVR8 in complex with RUP2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015943", "name" "WD40/YVTN repeat-like-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45389" "WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN RUP1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein RUP1/2", "short" "RUP1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 229, "taxa" 899, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 517, "sets" 0, "proteins" 517, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 310}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044616", :literature {"PUB00096543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wang W" "Yang D" "Feldmann KA."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "EFO1 and EFO2, encoding putative WD-domain proteins, have overlapping and distinct roles in the regulation of vegetative development and flowering of Arabidopsis.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1077-88", "volume" "62", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21242318}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044616", "name" "WD repeat-containing protein RUP1/2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
