The repressor proteins (xylR and nagC) from this family possess an N-terminal region not present in the sugar kinases and which contains an helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4htl", "name" "Lmo2764 protein, a putative N-acetylmannosamine kinase, from Listeria monocytogenes"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043129", "name" "ATPase, nucleotide binding domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00480" "ROK family"}, "panther" {"PTHR18964" "ROK (REPRESSOR, ORF, KINASE) FAMILY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ROK family", "short" "ROK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 254, "proteomes" 8342, "taxa" 33331, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 148134, "sets" 0, "proteins" 145085, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 110100}, "pathways" 42}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00866", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00866"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1463", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1463"} {"accession" "GenProp1565", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1565"} {"accession" "GenProp1737", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1737"} {"accession" "GenProp1599", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1599"} {"accession" "GenProp1394", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1394"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
