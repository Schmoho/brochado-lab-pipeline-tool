{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The pyridine nucleotide-disulphide reductases (PNDR) use the isoalloxazine ring of FAD to shuttle reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H to a Cys residue that is usually a part of a redox-active disulphide bridge. In a second step, the reduced disulphide reduces the substrate. On the basis of sequence and structural similarities [[cite:PUB00004100]], PNDR can be categorised into 2 groups.</p>\n\n<p>Class I includes glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase and mercuric reductase. They cover a wide range of catalytic functions: glutathione reductase ensures that the cell has enough reduced glutathione to maintain protein thiol groups in the reduced state [[cite:PUB00000154]]; trypanothione reductase carries out the analogous reaction in trypanosomal cells (trypanothione is an analogue of glutathione) [[cite:PUB00000284]]; lipoamide dehydrogenase, the E3 component of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, oxidises the dihydrolypoyl groups of lipoate acyltransferase, and so couples glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle [[cite:PUB00000149]]; and mercuric reductase enables bacteria to detoxify the mercuric ion by reducing it to elemental mercury, which evaporates from the cell [[cite:PUB00004586]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6aon", "name" "1.72 Angstrom Resolution Crystal Structure of 2-Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex Subunit Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase from Bordetella pertussis in Complex with FAD"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000350" "Mercury(II) reductase, MerA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase, class I", "short" "Pyr_nuc-diS_OxRdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 246, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11372, "taxa" 42952, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 127369, "sets" 0, "proteins" 125467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 95458}, "pathways" 102}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
