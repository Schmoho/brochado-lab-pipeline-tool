{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1) domain containing proteins, including LSH1-10 from Arabidopsis and G1/G1L1-8 from rice. G1 may be involved in transcriptional regulation and specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet [[cite:PUB00072583]]. LSH1 is involved in phytochrome-mediated light signaling and in shoot meristem identity [[cite:PUB00090714]]. The expression of LSH3 and LSH4 can be regulated by CUC1, which may suppress organ differentiation in the boundary region [[cite:PUB00090715]].</p>\n\n<p>The 125-residue ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and oryza G1) domain is rich in basic amino acids, especially arginine, and is highly conserved among land plants. Members of the ALOG family of proteins function as key developmental regulators. It has been proposed that the ALOG domain originated from the N- terminal DNA-binding domains of integrases belonging to the tyrosine recombinase superfamily encoded by a distinct type of DIRS1-like LTR retrotransposon found in several eukaryotes. Secondary structure predictions revealed an all-Î± helical domain with four conserved helices [[cite:PUB00072583], [cite:PUB00072584]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31165" "PROTEIN G1-LIKE2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ALOG family", "short" "ALOG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 262, "taxa" 1049, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2921}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040222", :literature {"PUB00072584" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
