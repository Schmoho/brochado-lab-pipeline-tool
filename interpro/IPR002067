{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes mitochondrial carrier proteins that transport a broad variety of substrates and, therefore, they are involved in different metabolic pathways such as the TCA cycle, lipid metabolism, nucleotides metabolism [[cite:PUB00152845], [cite:PUB00152848], [cite:PUB00152846], [cite:PUB00152847]] and energy transfer [[cite:PUB00005351], [cite:PUB00001005], [cite:PUB00005084], [cite:PUB00003301], [cite:PUB00097195]]. Some examples of this group are the uncoupling proteins (UCPs), mitochondrial transporter proteins that create proton leaks across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, energy is dissipated in the form of heat. Mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 from chordates (UCP1) is responsible for thermogenic respiration, a specialised capacity of brown adipose tissue to the regulation of energy balance. It regulates the production of reactive oxygen species/ROS by mitochondria [[cite:PUB00101071], [cite:PUB00101070]]. ADP/ATP carrier protein (ADP/ATP translocase); 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein; phosphate carrier protein; tricarboxylate transport protein (or citrate transport protein); Solute carrier family 25 member 16 (also known as Graves disease carrier protein); yeast mitochondrial proteins MRS3 and MRS4; yeast mitochondrial FAD carrier protein; and many others. This family also includes peroxisomal proteins like PMP34 [[cite:PUB00057422]].</p>\n\n<p>These proteins share a tripartite structure, each of the repeated segments being about 100 residues in length [[cite:PUB00001005]]. Overall, the structure shows a channel-like structure [[cite:PUB00101069]]. Sequence analysis of this family has suggested the presence of six (TM) domains, with varying degrees of sequence conservation and hydrophilicity [[cite:PUB00001005]]. The TM regions, and adjacent hydrophilic loops, are more highly conserved than other regions of the proteins [[cite:PUB00001005]]. Five of the six TM domains are followed by the conserved sequence (D/E)-Hy(K/R), where -denotes any residue and Hy is a hydrophobic position [[cite:PUB00001005]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023395", "name" "Mitochondrial carrier domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00784" "MTUNCOUPLING", "PR00926" "MITOCARRIER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial carrier protein", "short" "Mit_carrier"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2714, "taxa" 12376, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 476676, "sets" 0, "proteins" 100510, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 63785}, "pathways" 105}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002067", :literature {"PUB00152845" {"URL" nil, "issue" "27", "authors" ["Fiermonte G" "Paradies E" "Todisco S" "Marobbio CM" "Palmieri F."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014118", "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "A novel member of solute carrier family 25 (SLC25A42) is a transporter of coenzyme A and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate in human mitochondria.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "18152-9", "volume" "284", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19429682}, "PUB00005351" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Klingenberg M."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
