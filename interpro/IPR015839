{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The pathway of chloromethane utilization, which allows the microorganisms that possess it to grow with chloromethane as the sole carbon and energy source, is believed to be initiated by a corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase system involving methyltransferase I (CmuA) and methyltransferase II (CmuB), which transfer the methyl group of chloromethane onto tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) [[cite:PUB00016918]]. The methyl group of chloromethane is first transferred by the protein CmuA to a corrinoid protein, from where it is transferred to H4folate by CmuB, yielding methyl-H4folate [[cite:PUB00016919], [cite:PUB00016920]]. Both CmuA and CmuB display sequence similarity to methyltransferases of methanogenic archaea.</p>\n\n<p>CmuA is a two-domain methyltransferase/corrinoid-binding protein involved in methyl transfer from chloromethane to a corrin moiety. CmuA shows similarity to known methyltransferases as well as to their cognate corrinoid protein-binding proteins in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of its sequence, respectively [[cite:PUB00016918]]. Mutation analysis shows that CmuA acts as methyltransferase I [[cite:PUB00016918]]. Mutation analysis shows that CmuA acts as methyltransferase I [[cite:PUB00016918]]. By analogy to similar methyltransferase systems, it is thought that CmuA acts as both the methyltransferase I and the corrinoid-binding protein in the dehalogenation of chloromethane [[cite:PUB00016919]]. Therefore, CmuA catalyses the first step of the chloromethane-degradation pathway, comprising the dehalogenation of chloromethane and the methylation of an associated cobalt corrin moiety.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038071", "name" "UROD/MetE-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036688" "Bifunctional chloromethane dehalogenation methyltransferase/corrinoid-binding protein CmuA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional chloromethane dehalogenation methyltransferase corrinoid-binding protein CmuA", "short" "CmuA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 46, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015839", :literature {"PUB00016918" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Vannelli T" "Messmer M" "Studer A" "Vuilleumier S" "Leisinger T."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
