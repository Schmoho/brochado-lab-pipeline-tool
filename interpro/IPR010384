{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mlc titration factor A (MtfA, previously known as YeeI) is a transcription factor A that binds Mlc (make large colonies), itself a repressor of glucose and hence a protein important in regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose-phosphotransferase (ptsG) system, the major glucose transporter in E. coli. Mlc is a repressor of ptsG, and MtfA is found to bind and inactivate Mlc with high affinity [[cite:PUB00054592]]. The membrane-bound protein EIICBGlc encoded by the ptsG gene is the major glucose transporter in Escherichia coli. MtfA is found to be a glucose-regulated peptidase [[cite:PUB00066805]], whose activity is regulated by binding to Mlc available in the cytoplasm, which in turn has been released from EIICBGlc during times when no glucose is taken up. A physiologically relevant target for this peptidase is not yet known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3khi", "name" "Crystal structure of a Putative Metal-dependent Hydrolase (YP_001336084.1) from Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578 at 1.95 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042252", "name" "MtfA, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20169" "Mlc titration factor A (MtfA) is a zinc metallopeptidase (M90 peptidase)"}, "panther" {"PTHR30164" "MTFA PEPTIDASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_01593" "Protein MtfA [mtfA]"}, "pfam" {"PF06167" "Glucose-regulated metallo-peptidase M90"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MtfA family", "short" "MtfA_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 31, "proteomes" 1857, "taxa" 8410, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9516, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9499, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7209}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
