{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protocatechuate (PCA) 4,5-dioxygenase is the first enzyme in the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway that is an alternative to PCA 3,4-cleavage and PCA 2,3 cleavage pathways [[cite:PUB00081197], [cite:PUB00081198]]. PCA is an intermediate in the breakdown of lignin (hence the gene symbol ligA) and other compounds. It is composed of A and B subunits that form a tetramer [[cite:PUB00011779]].
