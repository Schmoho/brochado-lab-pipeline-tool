{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry belong to the polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2) family, which is not related in sequence to PPK1. While PPK1 tends to act in the biosynthesis of polyphosphate, or poly(P), members of the PPK2 family tend to use the terminal phosphate of poly(P) to regenerate ATP or GTP from the corresponding nucleoside diphosphate, or ADP from AMP as is the case with polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase (PAP). Members of this protein family use poly(P) as a donor to convert both AMP to ADP and ADP to ATP [[cite:PUB00051190]]. AMP/ADP-polyphosphate phosphotransferase from Meiothermus ruber can also use GMP, CMP, UMP, GDP, CDP and UDP [[cite:PUB00099651]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7plj", "name" "Structure of Polyphosphate kinase 2 from Deinococcus radiodurans, in complex with ATP and polyphosphates."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03709" "PPK2 family polyphosphate kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyphosphate:nucleotide phosphotransferase, PPK2", "short" "PPK2-rel_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2916, "taxa" 10836, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11157, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11157, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8531}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0840", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0840"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
