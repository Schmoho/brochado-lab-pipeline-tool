{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a p53 negative regulator Mdm2/Mdm4.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>MDM2 is an oncoprotein that acts as a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumour suppressor by binding to the transactivation domain of p53 and suppressing its ability to activate transcription [[cite:PUB00013998]]. In addition, MDM2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 [[cite:PUB00034794]]. P53 acts in response to DNA damage, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Inactivation of p53 is a common occurrence in neoplastic transformations. MDM2 is also known to have p53-independent functions.</p>\n\n<p>The core of MDM2 folds into an open bundle of four helices which is capped by two small 3-stranded β-sheets. It consists of a duplication of two structural repeats. MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 α-helix binds; p53 residues involved in transactivation are buried deep within the cleft of MDM2, thereby concealing the p53 transactivation domain. In addition to its N-terminal p53 binding domain, MDM2 contains a central acidic domain, zinc finger domain and a C-terminal RING-finger domain.</p>\n\n<p>MDM4, also known as MDMX, is a MDM2-related protein that has also been shown to inhibit p53, although not as well as MDM2. Most studies have not been able to ascribe E3 ligase function to MDM4.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6q9l", "name" "HDM2 (17-111, WILDTYPE) COMPLEXED WITH COMPOUND 9 AT 1.13A; Structural states of Hdm2 and HdmX: X-ray elucidation of adaptations and binding interactions for different chemical compound classes"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF006748" "p53 negative regulator Mdm2/Mdm4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "p53 negative regulator Mdm2/Mdm4", "short" "p53_neg-reg_MDM_2/4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 194, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 680, "taxa" 2456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3780, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3073, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2104}, "pathways" 50}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
