{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The FnlA enzyme is the first step in the biosynthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-L-fucosamine (UDP-FucNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc in Escherichia coli (along with FnlB and FnlC).  Proteins in this entry includes FnlA homologues in the O-antigen clusters of O4, O25, O26, O29 (Shigella D11), O118, O145 and O172 serotype strains, all of which produce O-antigens containing FucNAc (or the further modified FucNAm).  A homologue from Pseudomonas aerugiosa serotype O11, WbjB, also involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-FucNAc, has been characterised and is now believed to carry out both the initial 4,6-dehydratase reaction and the subsequent epimerisation of the resulting methyl group at C-5 [[cite:PUB00060758]].  A phylogenetic tree of related sequences shows a distinct clade of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-QuiNAc (Qui=quinovosamine). This clade appears to be descendant from the common ancestor of the Pseudomonas and E. coli fucose-biosynthesis enzymes.  It has been hypothesised [[cite:PUB00060759]] that the first step in the biosynthesis of these two compounds may be the same, and thus that these enzymes all have the same function.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04130" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4,6-dehydratase/5-epimerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4,6-dehydratase/5-epimerase", "short" "FnlA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 81, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 77, "sets" 0, "proteins" 77, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 63}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026415", :literature {"PUB00060758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Mulrooney EF" "Poon KK" "McNally DJ" "Brisson JR" "Lam JS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
