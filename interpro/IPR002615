{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the photosystem I reaction centre subunit IX or PsaJ from various organisms including Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), Pinus thunbergii (Japanese black pine) and Zea mays (Maize). PsaJ ([swissprot:P19443]) is a small 4.4kDa, chloroplast encoded, hydrophobic subunit of the photosystem I reaction complex whose function is not yet fully understood [[cite:PUB00000458]]. PsaJ can be cross-linked to PsaF ([swissprot:P12356]) and has a single predicted transmembrane domain. It may help in the organization of the PsaE and PsaF subunits. It has a proposed role in maintaining PsaF in the correct orientation to allow for fast electron transfer from soluble donor proteins to P700+ [[cite:PUB00000458]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems (I and II) located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae. Photosystem II (PSII) has a P680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll 'a' that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation (splitting) of water molecules, and to produce ATP via a proton pump. Photosystem I (PSI) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated hydrogen donated from PSII to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by PSII, releasing oxygen as a by-product [[cite:PUB00152828]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8wey", "name" "PSI-LHCI of the red alga Cyanidium caldarium RK-1 (NIES-2137)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036062", "name" "Photosystem I PsaJ, reaction centre subunit IX superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36082" "PTHR36082"}, "hamap" {"MF_00522" "Photosystem I reaction center subunit IX [psaJ]"}, "pfam" {"PF01701" "Photosystem I reaction centre subunit IX / PsaJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem I PsaJ, reaction centre subunit IX", "short" "PSI_PsaJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 118, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 283, "taxa" 21111, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14148, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14148, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11327}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1353", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1353"} {"accession" "GenProp0660", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0660"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002615", :literature {"PUB00000458" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Fischer N" "Boudreau E" "Hippler M" "Drepper F" "Haehnel W" "Rochaix JD."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi982821a", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "A large fraction of PsaF is nonfunctional in photosystem I complexes lacking the PsaJ subunit.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "5546-52", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10220342}, "PUB00152828" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Zabret J" "Bohn S" "Schuller SK" "Arnolds O" "Moller M" "Meier-Credo J" "Liauw P" "Chan A" "Tajkhorshid E" "Langer JD" "Stoll R" "Krieger-Liszkay A" "Engel BD" "Rudack T" "Schuller JM" "Nowaczyk MM."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Plants", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-021-00895-0", "medline_journal" "Nat Plants", "title" "Structural insights into photosystem II assembly.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "524-538", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33846594}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015979", "name" "photosynthesis", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0009522", "name" "photosystem I", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002615", "name" "Photosystem I PsaJ, reaction centre subunit IX", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 27, "alignment:full" 383}}}
