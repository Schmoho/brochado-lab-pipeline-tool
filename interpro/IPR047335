{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins from animals, including RUN and FYVE domain-containing protein 1-3 (RUNFY1-3) from mammals.</p>\n\n<p>RUFY1, also called  Rab4-interacting protein (Rabip4), is an homologue of mouse Rabip4, an effector of Rab4 GTPase that regulates recycling of endocytosed cargo. RUFY1 is an endosomal protein that functions as a dual effector of Rab4 and Rab14 and is involved in efficient recycling of transferrin (Tfn). It is a downstream effector of Etk, a downstream tyrosine kinase of PI3-kinase that is involved in regulation of vesicle trafficking. RUFY1 contains an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal FYVE domain with two coiled-coil domains in-between [[cite:PUB00102658], [cite:PUB00018297], [cite:PUB00102657], [cite:PUB00093242], [cite:PUB00102655], [cite:PUB00102656]].</p>\n\n<p>RUFY2 is a novel embryonic factor that contains an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal FYVE domain with two coiled-coil domains in-between. It is present in the nucleus at early stages of embryonic development. It may have both endosomal functions in the cytoplasm and nuclear functions. It is a paralogue of RUFY1 [[cite:PUB00102655]].</p>\n\n<p>RUFY3, also called Single axon-regulated protein (Singar), is an N-terminal RUN domain and a C-terminal FYVE domain containing protein predominantly expressed in the brain. It suppresses formation of surplus axons for neuronal polarity. Unlike other RUFY proteins, RUFY3 can associate with the GTP-bound active form of Rab5 [[cite:PUB00018296], [cite:PUB00102659], [cite:PUB00102661]]. RUFY3 plays a role in the formation of F-actin-enriched protrusive structures at the cell periphery, in cytoskeletal organisation, and in the generation of neuronal polarity formation and axon growth [[cite:PUB00102660]]. This protein promotes gastric cancer cell migration and invasion in a PAK1-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00102662]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2dwk", "name" "Crystal structure of the RUN domain of mouse Rap2 interacting protein x"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45956" "RUN AND FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RUN and FYVE domain-containing protein 1-3", "short" "RUFY1-3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 998, "taxa" 4035, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6601, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6601, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4073}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047335", :literature {"PUB00018296" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Callebaut I" "de Gunzburg J" "Goud B" "Mornon JP."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
