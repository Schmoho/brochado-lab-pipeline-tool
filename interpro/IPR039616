{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE)-related proteins 1-4 (CLE1-4) from Arabidopsis and 33 from Medicago truncatula. They mimic host plant CLE extracellular signal peptides that regulate cell fat. CLE1 may play a role in the differentiation or division of feeding cells (syncytia) induced in plant roots during infection [[cite:PUB00095222], [cite:PUB00153041], [cite:PUB00089427]]. CLE33 is a signaling peptide involved in the regulation of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi [[cite:PUB00101453]]. It moves from root to shoot to function with the receptor kinase SUNN, in a signalling pathway that repress strigolactone biosynthetic genes and strigolactone content in the roots, and consequently reduces the promotion of further colonization by AM fungi [[cite:PUB00101453]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The CLE proteins share a C-terminal CLE domain with CLV3, a small secreted polypeptide that is active as a ligand and has a function in shoot apical meristem maintenance [[cite:PUB00089881]]. In general, the CLE-related proteins are C-terminally processed to generate an active CLE peptide [[cite:PUB00078257]]. These small secreted peptide hormones then function in a variety of developmental and physiological processes [[cite:PUB00089882], [cite:PUB00089427]].
