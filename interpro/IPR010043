{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes GlnD, the uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme for signal-transduction protein PII, and acts as the sensory component of the nitrogen regulation (ntr) system [[cite:PUB00015137], [cite:PUB00006542]]. The ntr system modulates nitrogen metabolism in response to the prevailing nitrogen source and the requirements of the cell. During nitrogen fixation, ammonia and 2-oxoglutarate can be used to produce glutamate. The activity of the PII protein is stimulated by glutamine and inhibited by 2-oxoglutarate. Under glutamate-limiting conditions, PII is uridylylated by GlnD leading to the activation of glutamate synthetase and to the stimulation of NtrC-dependent promoters. Under high concentrations of fixed nitrogen, PII is de-uridylylated leading to the inactivation of the glutamate synthetase pathway and switching off NtrC-dependent promoters [[cite:PUB00015136]].</p>\r\n<p>Not all homologues of PII share the property of uridylyltransferase modification on the characteristic Tyr residue (see [interpro:IPR002332]), but the modification site is preserved in the PII homologue of all species with a member of this family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47320" "BIFUNCTIONAL URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE/URIDYLYL-REMOVING ENZYME"}, "hamap" {"MF_00277" "Bifunctional uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme [glnD]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006288" "[protein PII] uridylyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01693" "[protein-PII] uridylyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bifunctional uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme", "short" "UTase/UR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4895, "taxa" 18588, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23977, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23895, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18040}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
