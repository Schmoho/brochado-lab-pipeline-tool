{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase from Klebsiella pneumoniae (HpxO) and similar sequences mainly found in gammaproteobacteria and actinomycetes. HpxO is an FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase ([ec:1.14.13.113]) that is responsible for the conversion of uric acid to 5-hydroxyisourate, which decomposes spontaneously to allantoin and CO2. It oxidises NADH to NAD(+), and produces H20 [[cite:PUB00105204]]. This enzyme contains the GxGxxG(x)17E sequence motif and is a member of the well-studied flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent glutathione reductase superfamily [[cite:PUB00065641]]. HpxO consists of two domains with the FAD-binding and active site located at the interface of these domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rp8", "name" "Crystal Structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae R204Q HpxO complexed with FAD"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033623" "FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase HpxO"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase", "short" "HpxO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 205, "taxa" 1272, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1008, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1008, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 737}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
