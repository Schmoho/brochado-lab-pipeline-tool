{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Selenocysteine tRNA 1 associated proteins (also known as TRNAU1AP) is involved in the early steps of selenocysteine biosynthesis and tRNA(Sec) charging to the later steps resulting in the cotranslational incorporation of selenocysteine into selenoproteins. Selenium deficiency results in a variety of diseases, including cardiac disease [[cite:PUB00091433]]. TRNAU1AP contains RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a Tyr-rich region found in the C-terminal. The Tyr-rich region (amino acids 185-225) is conserved among several mammals, including human, chimp, dog, cattle, mouse and rat. Furthermore, constitutive deletion of exons corresponding to the Tyr-rich region in mouse resulted in embryonic lethality [[cite:PUB00091434]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised protein C6orf52 from humans.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37457" "TRNA SELENOCYSTEINE 1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA selenocysteine 1-associated protein 1", "short" "TSAP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 936, "taxa" 3679, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2621, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2621, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1780}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040434", :literature {"PUB00091433" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Li MD" "Cheng WP" "Shi MX" "Ge TD" "Zheng XL" "Wu DY" "Hu XY" "Luo JC" "Li FL" "Li H."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Med Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2016.6099", "medline_journal" "Mol Med Rep", "title" "Role of tRNA selenocysteine 1 associated protein 1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of cardiomyocyteâ€‘like H9c2 cells.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "988-994", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28101579}, "PUB00091434" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Mahdi Y" "Xu XM" "Carlson BA" "Fradejas N" "Gunter P" "Braun D" "Southon E" "Tessarollo L" "Hatfield DL" "Schweizer U."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127349", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Expression of Selenoproteins Is Maintained in Mice Carrying Mutations in SECp43, the tRNA Selenocysteine 1 Associated Protein (Trnau1ap).", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "e0127349", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26043259}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR040434", "name" "tRNA selenocysteine 1-associated protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
