{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents 2-methylfumaryl-CoA isomerase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus (Mct) and similar bacterial proteins. Mct is involved in the glyoxylate assimilation cycle used to regenerate acetyl-CoA and produce pyruvate as universal precursor for biosynthesis. This reaction involves an intramolecular CoA transferase that catalyses the reversible transfer of the CoA moiety from the C1-carboxyl group of mesaconyl-CoA to the C4-carboxyl group. It does not require free mesaconate as CoA acceptor [[cite:PUB00060445]]. Members of this protein family belong by homology to the family of CoA transferases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023606", "name" "CoA-transferase family III domain 1 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04253" "2-methylfumaryl-CoA isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-methylfumaryl-CoA isomerase-like", "short" "Mct-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 85, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 46, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
