{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes 3'-5' ssDNA/RNA exonuclease TatD and many uncharacterised deoxyribonucleases and metal-dependent hydrolases. The family is related to a large superfamily of metalloenzymes [[cite:PUB00004994]]. TatD has been shown to be a 3'-5' exonuclease that processes single-stranded DNA in DNA repair [[cite:PUB00007123], [cite:PUB00077112]].</p>\n\n<p>In E. coli TatD, which adopts a TIM-barrel fold, is encoded by a operon that encodes Tat proteins, including TatA, TatB, and TatC, for protein transport via the Tat (Twin-Arginine Translocation) pathway. However, TatD is not involved in the protein export in the Tat pathway [[cite:PUB00007123]].</p>\n\n<p>Deoxyribonuclease TATDN1 from Danio rerio (Zebrafish) catalyses (in vitro) the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA producing linear DNA molecules. It is involved in chromosomal segregation and cell cycle progression during eye development [[cite:PUB00100210]]. TATDN1 has been related to several types of cancer [[cite:PUB00100212], [cite:PUB00100209], [cite:PUB00100211]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1zzm", "name" "Crystal structure of YJJV, TATD Homolog from Escherichia coli k12, at 1.8 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01310" "TatD_DNAse"}, "pfam" {"PF01026" "TatD related DNase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF005902" "Mg-dependent DNase, TatD type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3'-5' ssDNA/RNA exonuclease TatD-like", "short" "TatD-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 318, "proteomes" 12206, "taxa" 47664, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 84482, "sets" 0, "proteins" 84232, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 62814}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00836", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00836"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
