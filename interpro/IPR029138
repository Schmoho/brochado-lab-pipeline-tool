{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 5 (also known as SNAPC5 or SNAPc19) is part of the core components of the SNAPc complex required for the transcription of both RNA polymerase II and III small-nuclear RNA genes [[cite:PUB00070247]]. The RNA polymerase II snRNA promoters consist of a proximal sequence element (PSE), while the RNA polymerase III snRNA promoters consist of both a PSE and a TATA box. SNAPc binds to the PSE in both RNA polymerases and other PSE sequences in other snRNA genes. Therefore,  SNAPc is also called the PSE transcription factor (PTF) or PSE-binding protein (PBP).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15333" "SNRNA-ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX SUBUNIT 5"}, "pfam" {"PF15497" "snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 19, SNAPc subunit 19"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 5", "short" "SNAPC5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 626, "taxa" 2750, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1000, "sets" 0, "proteins" 967, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 659}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029138", :literature {"PUB00069818" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Jawdekar GW" "Henry RW."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
