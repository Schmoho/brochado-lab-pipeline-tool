{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents conjugated bile acid hydrolase from Clostridium perfringens (CBAH) and similar sequences from firmicutes and actinomycetes. CBAH is a bile salt hydrolase that catalyses the deconjugation of glycine- and taurine-linked bile salts, which occurs naturally in the intestines of humans, releasing amino acid residues and deconjugated bile salts (bile acids). This enzyme can also hydrolyse the amide bond in major human bile salts, such as glycocholate (GCA), taurocholate (TCA) and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA). It shows a slight preference for taurine-conjugated bile acids as substrates [[cite:PUB00019256], [cite:PUB00032772]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7svg", "name" "Bile Salt Hydrolase A from Lactobacillus gasseri with chenodeoxycholate and taurine bound"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029055", "name" "Nucleophile aminohydrolases, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038245" "choloylglycine hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Conjugated bile acid hydrolase", "short" "CBAH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 328, "taxa" 1706, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2083, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2083, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1523}, "pathways" 239}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
