{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor/metal-dependent RNase from Cenarchaeum symbiosum (CPSF1) and similar sequences mainly found in archaea. CPSF1 has been characterised as a ribonuclease essential for transcription termination to ensure programmed transcriptome and an optimal growth and physiology. It associates with archaeal RNAP and cleaves the transcript at the 3'-end, downstream the uridine-rich sequences recognised by its N-terminal KH-domain, a characteristic RNA binding domain [[cite:PUB00095180], [cite:PUB00045375]].</p>\n\n<p>Transcription termination factor FttA from Pyrococcus abyssi is also included in this family. FttA is a single-stranded endoribonuclease (endoRNase) with a preference for cleavage at CA dinucleotides and 5'-3' exoribonuclease (exoRNase) activity on 5'-monophosphorylated RNA [[cite:PUB00106760]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036866", "name" "Ribonuclease Z/Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03675" "beta-CASP ribonuclease aCPSF1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription termination factor CPSF1, archaea", "short" "aCPSF1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 289, "taxa" 2286, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3183, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3183, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2580}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019975", :literature {"PUB00095180" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yue L" "Li J" "Zhang B" "Qi L" "Li Z" "Zhao F" "Li L" "Zheng X" "Dong X."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "The conserved ribonuclease aCPSF1 triggers genome-wide transcription termination of Archaea via a 3'-end cleavage mode.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32857850}, "PUB00045375" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Makarova KS" "Sorokin AV" "Novichkov PS" "Wolf YI" "Koonin EV."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
