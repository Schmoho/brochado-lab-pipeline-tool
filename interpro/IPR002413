{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans [WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994)]. This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation.</p>\n\n<p>The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Dol m 5, Pol d 5, Pol e 5, Pol f 5, Sol i 3, Sol r 3, Ves c 5,Ves f 5, Ves g 5, Ves m 5, Ves p 5, Ves s 5, Ves v 5, Ves vi 5 and Vesp m 5.</p>\n\n<p>Venom allergen 5 (Ves 5) is a major allergen of vespid wasp venom [[cite:PUB00003182]]. Regions of conservation have been identified that are shared both by a family of proteins from human, mouse and rat testis, and by a class of pathogenesis-related proteins from Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco) and Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) (Lycopersicon esculentum) leaves. Ves 5 also shares similarity with the Solenopsis invicta (Red imported fire ant) 3 allergen [[cite:PUB00002052]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qnx", "name" "Ves v 5, an allergen from Vespula vulgaris venom"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035940", "name" "CAP superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00838" "V5ALLERGEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Venom allergen 5-like", "short" "V5_allergen-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1897, "taxa" 7763, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35347, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11911, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7830}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002413", :literature {"PUB00003182" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Lu G" "Villalba M" "Coscia MR" "Hoffman DR" "King TP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
