{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ubiquinone (Q) functions as an electron carrier in the respiratory chain in mitochondria. Q biosynthesis involves a series of enzymatic steps, which are catalysed by the enzymes COQ1-COQ8 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast). COQ6, or ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase, is a flavin-dependent enzyme localised to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane that is required for one or more steps in Q biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00013848], [cite:PUB00013831]]. In mammals and yeast, this enzyme is responsible for the C5-ring hydroxylation during ubiquinone biosynthesis, catalysing the hydroxylation of 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB) to 3-hexaprenyl-4,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHHB) [[cite:PUB00154465], [cite:PUB00105224]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01989" "ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase COQ6"}, "hamap" {"MF_03193" "Ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase COQ6, mitochondrial [COQ6]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase COQ6", "short" "UbQ_mOase_COQ6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2081, "taxa" 7074, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3553, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3553, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2230}, "pathways" 127}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
