{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of secreted lipases.

Also included in this family is lactone esterase (also known as lipase-like enzyme SBLE), which is responsible for the lactonization of acidic sophorolipids [[cite:PUB00088162]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3h2g", "name" "Crystal structure of a rice cell wall degrading esterase LipA from Xanthomonas oryzae"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34853" "PTHR34853"}, "pfam" {"PF03583" "Secretory lipase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF029171" "Secreted esterase, LipA type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipase, secreted", "short" "Lipase_secreted"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 62, "proteomes" 2390, "taxa" 8826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18651, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18266, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13575}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
