{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Fibulins are a family of ECM glycoproteins characterized by a fibulin-type C-terminal domain preceded by tandem calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules. They are involved in protein-protein interaction with the components of basement membrane and extracellular matrix proteins. There are five fibulins, which can be classified into two subgroups. Fibulin-1 and -2 constitute one subgroup. These fibulins are larger than the others due to the presence of a higher number of EGF modules and an extra domain with three anaphylatoxin modules [[cite:PUB00068014]]. Members of the second subgroup, fibulin-3, -4, and -5, are similarly small in size and highly homologous to one another in modular structure. They consist of a modified cbEGF domain at the N terminus followed by five tandem cbEGF modules and the fibulin-type C-terminal region.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the fibulin-1 proteins, which are incorporated into fibronectin-containing matrix fibres and may play a role in cell adhesion and migration [[cite:PUB00056854]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036313" "Fibulin-1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fibulin-1", "short" "Fibulin-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 673, "taxa" 2334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2630, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1960, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1176}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017048", :literature {"PUB00056854" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Tran H" "Mattei M" "Godyna S" "Argraves WS."], "ISO_journal" "Matrix Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0945-053X(97)90021-4", "medline_journal" "Matrix Biol", "title" "Human fibulin-1D: molecular cloning, expression and similarity with S1-5 protein, a new member of the fibulin gene family.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "479-93", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9106159}, "PUB00068014" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Kobayashi N" "Kostka G" "Garbe JH" "Keene DR" "Bachinger HP" "Hanisch FG" "Markova D" "Tsuda T" "Timpl R" "Chu ML" "Sasaki T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
