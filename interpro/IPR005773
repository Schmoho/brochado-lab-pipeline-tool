{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of virulence translocation proteins mainly found in the type III secretion system in proteobacteria, including Yop proteins translocation protein R from Yersinia pestis (YscR) and Surface presentation of antigens protein SpaP from Salmonella typhimurium.\nYscR is a component of the yop secretion machinery. It may have a role in the negative pathway regulation of yop expression controlled by calcium. SpaP is involved in a secretory pathway responsible for the surface presentation of determinants needed for the entry of Salmonella species into mammalian cells [[cite:PUB00106863]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01102" "type III secretion system export apparatus subunit SctR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system, Yop virulence translocation protein R-like", "short" "T3SS_YscR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 413, "taxa" 3080, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3698, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3698, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3014}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0052", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0052"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005773", :literature {"PUB00106863" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Li J" "Ochman H" "Groisman EA" "Boyd EF" "Solomon F" "Nelson K" "Selander RK."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Relationship between evolutionary rate and cellular location among the Inv/Spa invasion proteins of Salmonella enterica.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "7252-6", "volume" "92", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7638176}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015031", "name" "protein transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016020", "name" "membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005838", "name" "Type III secretion system inner membrane P protein", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR005773", "name" "Type III secretion system, Yop virulence translocation protein R-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR005837", "name" "Flagellar transport protein FliP", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
