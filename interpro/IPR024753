{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AriR, also known as YmgB, is part of the three gene cluster ymgABC which has a role in biofilm development and stability. YmgB represses biofilm formation in rich medium containing glucose, decreases cellular motility and also protects the cell from acid, which indicates that YmgB has an important function in acid-resistance [[cite:PUB00048568]]. YmgB binds as a dimer to genes which are important for biofilm formation via a ligand. Due to its important function in acid resistance it is also known as AriR (regulator of acid resistance influenced by indole) [[cite:PUB00048568]]. AriR may be a non-specific DNA-binding protein that binds genes and/or intergenic regions via a geometric recognition.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2oxl", "name" "Structure and Function of the E. coli Protein YmgB: a Protein Critical for Biofilm Formation and Acid Resistance"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10798" "Biofilm development protein YmgB/AriR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Regulatory protein AriR", "short" "AriR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 69, "taxa" 874, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1682, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1682, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1221}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024753", :literature {"PUB00048568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lee J" "Page R" "Garcia-Contreras R" "Palermino JM" "Zhang XS" "Doshi O" "Wood TK" "Peti W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
