{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins which includes Bacteriophage T4 endonuclease VII, Mycobacteriophage D29 gene 59, and other as yet uncharacterised proteins. The T4 endonuclease VII (Endo VII) recognises a broad spectrum of DNA substrates ranging from branched DNAs to single base mismatches. The structure of this enzyme has been resolved and it was found that the monomers form an elongated, intertwined molecular dimer that exibits extreme domain swapping. Two pairs of antiparallel helices which form a novel 'four-helix cross' motif are the major dimerisation elements [[cite:PUB00007425]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1e7l", "name" "Endonuclease VII (EndoVII) N62D mutant from phage T4"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044925", "name" "His-Me finger superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038563", "name" "Recombination endonuclease VII superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02945" "Recombination endonuclease VII"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Recombination endonuclease VII", "short" "Endonuclease_7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 53, "proteomes" 1068, "taxa" 6432, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5843, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5774, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2039}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004211", :literature {"PUB00007425" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Raaijmakers H" "Vix O" "Toro I" "Golz S" "Kemper B" "Suck D."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/18.6.1447", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "X-ray structure of T4 endonuclease VII: a DNA junction resolvase with a novel fold and unusual domain-swapped dimer architecture.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "1447-58", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10075917}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR004211", "name" "Recombination endonuclease VII", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 16, "alignment:full" 1856}}}
