{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cell division in bacteria is facilitated by a polymeric ring structure, the Z ring, composed of tubulin-like FtsZ protofilaments.  Correct positioning of the division plane is a prerequisite for the generation of daughter cells with a normal chromosome complement.  In  Caulobacter crescentus MipZ, an essential protein, coordinates and regulates the assembly of the FtsZ cytokinetic ring during cell division. MipZ, forms a complex with the partitioning protein ParB near the origin of replication and localizes with the duplicated origin regions to the cell poles. MipZ also directly interferes with FtsZ polymerisation, thereby restricting FtsZ ring formation to mid-cell, the region of lowest MipZ concentration.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2xj4", "name" "Structure of the bacterial cell division regulator protein MipZ"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09140" "ATPase MipZ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATPase MipZ", "short" "MipZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 1167, "taxa" 4251, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4052, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4047, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3200}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015223", :literature {"PUB00035421" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Thanbichler M" "Shapiro L."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.038", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "MipZ, a spatial regulator coordinating chromosome segregation with cell division in Caulobacter.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "147-62", "volume" "126", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16839883}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015223", "name" "ATPase MipZ", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 1240}}}
