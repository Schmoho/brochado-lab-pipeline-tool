{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Transketolase [ec:2.2.1.1] (TK) catalyses the reversible transfer of a two-carbon ketol unit from xylulose 5-phosphate to an aldose receptor, such as ribose 5-phosphate, to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate. This enzyme, together with transaldolase, provides a link between the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. TK requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor. In most sources where TK has been purified, it is a homodimer of approximately 70 Kd subunits. TK sequences from a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources [[cite:PUB00000209], [cite:PUB00000362]] show that the enzyme has been evolutionarily conserved. In the peroxisomes of methylotrophic yeast Pichia angusta (Yeast) (Hansenula polymorpha), there is a highly related enzyme, dihydroxy-acetone synthase (DHAS) [ec:2.2.1.3] (also known as formaldehyde transketolase), which exhibits a very unusual specificity by including formaldehyde amongst its substrates.</p>\n\n<p>1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXP synthase) [[cite:PUB00004906]] is an enzyme so far found in bacteria (gene dxs) and plants (gene CLA1) which catalyses the thiamine pyrophosphoate-dependent acyloin condensation reaction between carbon atoms 2 and 3 of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (dxp), a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway to isoprenoids, thiamine (vitamin B1), and pyridoxol (vitamin B6). DXP synthase is evolutionary related to TK. The N-terminal section, contains a histidine residue which appears to function in proton transfer during catalysis [[cite:PUB00001222]]. This entry represents the central section there are conserved acidic residues that are part of the active cleft and may participate in substrate-binding [[cite:PUB00001222]]. This group of proteins includes transketolase enzymes [ec:2.2.1.1] and 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase beta subunit [swissprot:P37941] [ec:1.2.4.4]. Both these enzymes utilise thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor, suggesting there may be common aspects in their mechanism of catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1qgd", "name" "TRANSKETOLASE FROM ESCHERICHIA COLI"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43522" "TRANSKETOLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transketolase family", "short" "Transketolase_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 70, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9225, "taxa" 33755, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 48855, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48855, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36488}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
