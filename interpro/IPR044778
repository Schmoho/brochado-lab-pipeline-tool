{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The family represents plant sugar transport proteins (STPs), also known as hexose transporters, including STP1-STP14 from Arabidopsis and Sugar transport proteins MST1-8 from Oryza sativa subsp. japonica [[cite:PUB00097068]]. They mediate the active uptake of hexoses such as glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, fructose, xylose, mannose, galactose, fucose, 2-deoxyglucose and arabinose, by sugar/hydrogen symport. Several STP family transporters are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, or at specific developmental stages. STP1 is the member with the highest expression level of all members and high expression is detected in photosynthetic tissues, such as leaves and stems, while roots, siliques, and flowers show lower expression levels. It plays a major role in the uptake and response of Arabidopsis seeds and seedlings to sugars [[cite:PUB00097067], [cite:PUB00097069]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7aaq", "name" "sugar/H+ symporter STP10 in outward occluded conformation"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036259", "name" "MFS transporter superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd17361" "Plant Sugar transport protein subfamily of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sugar transport protein STP/MST-like, plant", "short" "MFS_STP/MST-like_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 265, "taxa" 1061, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7960, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7877, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4487}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044778", :literature {"PUB00097068" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Wang Y" "Xiao Y" "Zhang Y" "Chai C" "Wei G" "Wei X" "Xu H" "Wang M" "Ouwerkerk PB" "Zhu Z."], "ISO_journal" "Planta", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Planta", "title" "Molecular cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis of a novel monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.).", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "525-35", "volume" "228", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18506478}, "PUB00097069" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4-5", "authors" ["Lemonnier P" "Gaillard C" "Veillet F" "Verbeke J" "Lemoine R" "Coutos-Thevenot P" "La Camera S."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "Expression of Arabidopsis sugar transport protein STP13 differentially affects glucose transport activity and basal resistance to Botrytis cinerea.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "473-84", "volume" "85", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24817131}, "PUB00097067" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Cordoba E" "Aceves-Zamudio DL" "Hernandez-Bernal AF" "Ramos-Vega M" "Leon P."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "Sugar regulation of SUGAR TRANSPORTER PROTEIN 1 (STP1) expression in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "147-59", "volume" "66", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25281700}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015145", "name" "monosaccharide transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0015749", "name" "monosaccharide transmembrane transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005828", "name" "Major facilitator, sugar transporter-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR003663", "name" "Sugar/inositol transporter", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044775", "name" "Sugar transporter ERD6/Tret1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR045262", "name" "Sugar transport protein STP/Polyol transporter PLT, plant", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR044776", "name" "Polyol transporter 1-6", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR044778", "name" "Sugar transport protein STP/MST-like, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR045263", "name" "Glucose transporter GLUT", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR002439", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 1 (GLUT1)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002440", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 2 (GLUT2)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002441", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 4 (GLUT4)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002442", "name" "Fructose transporter, type 5 (GLUT5)", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002945", "name" "Glucose transporter, type 3 (GLUT3)", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR047984", "name" "D-xylose-proton symporter-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR004736", "name" "MFS transporter, metabolite:H symporter", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004738", "name" "Phosphate permease", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR004749", "name" "Organic cation transport protein/SVOP", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR045915", "name" "Solute carrier family 22 members 4/5", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
