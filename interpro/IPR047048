{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the TlyA family of proteins which includes 16S/23S rRNA (cytidine-2'-O)-methyltransferase TlyA, Hemolysin A and related proteins.</p>\n\n<p>Haemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood cell membranes and cause cell rupture. The mechanism of action is not well defined. Hemolysin A is induced by sodium ribonucleate, and is produced by pathogenic bacterial strains. Hemolysin A from Treponema hyodysenteriae causes swine dysentery [[cite:PUB00043014]].</p>\n\n<p>16S/23S rRNA (cytidine-2'-O)-methyltransferase TlyA catalyses the 2'-O-methylation at nucleotides C1409 in 16S rRNA and C1920 in 23S rRNA [[cite:PUB00101705], [cite:PUB00059301], [cite:PUB00101707], [cite:PUB00101706]]. It is involved in virulence by promoting adherence and invasion to host cells [[cite:PUB00101709], [cite:PUB00101710], [cite:PUB00100388]]. In M. tuberculosis, it acts as a host evasion factor, that significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis by modulating adaptive immune responses by inhibiting host-protective Th1 and Th17 cytokine responses as well as autophagy [[cite:PUB00101708], [cite:PUB00100388]]. In Campylobacter jejuni, has been shown to be involved in susceptibility to antibiotic capreomycin [[cite:PUB00101707], [cite:PUB00100388]]. Additionally, TlyA may be involved in ribosomal biogenesis and assembly [[cite:PUB00101707], [cite:PUB00059302]]. TlyA also exhibits haemolytic activity in vitro, by binding with and forming oligomers into host cell membranes [[cite:PUB00059301], [cite:PUB00059302], [cite:PUB00043015]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hp7", "name" "Putative hemolysin from Streptococcus thermophilus."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR32319" "BACTERIAL HEMOLYSIN-LIKE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "16S/23S rRNA (cytidine-2'-O)-methyltransferase TlyA", "short" "TlyA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6165, "taxa" 23013, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25612, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25612, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19350}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
