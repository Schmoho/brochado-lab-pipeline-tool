{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family that includes bacterial 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH).</p>\n\n<p>The enzyme activities methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ([ec:1.5.1.20]) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH) ([ec:1.7.99.5]) differ in that the former (assigned in many eukaryotes) is defined to use NADP+ as an acceptor, while the latter (assigned in many bacteria) is flexible with respect to the acceptor. Both generate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.  From a larger set of proteins assigned as one or the other, this family describes the subset of proteins found in prokaryotes, and currently designated 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH) ([ec:1.7.99.5]). This protein is an FAD-containing flavoprotein [[cite:PUB00006438]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7th4", "name" "T. thermophilus methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase complex with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029041", "name" "FAD-linked oxidoreductase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00676" "methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [NAD(P)H]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase", "short" "MTHF_reductase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5520, "taxa" 20794, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22351, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22351, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17220}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1356", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1356"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
