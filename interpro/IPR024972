{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring)-dependent expression A (HdeA) protein is a stress response protein found in highly acid resistant bacteria such as Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli, but which is lacking in mildly acid tolerant bacteria such as Salmonella [[cite:PUB00013251]]. HdeA is one of the most abundant proteins found in the periplasmic space of E. coli, where it is one of a network of proteins that confer an acid resistance phenotype essential for the pathogenesis of enteric bacteria [[cite:PUB00013252]]. HdeA is thought to act as a chaperone, functioning to prevent the aggregation of periplasmic proteins denatured under acidic conditions. The HNS protein, a chromatin-associated protein that influences the gene expression of several environmentally-induced target genes, represses the expression of HdeA. HdeB, which is encoded within the same operon, may form heterodimers with HdeA. HdeA is a single domain Î±-helical [[cite:PUB00013251]] protein with an overall fold that is similar to the fold of the N-terminal subdomain of the GluRS anticodon-binding domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents acid stress chaperone HdeA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038303", "name" "HNS-dependent expression A/B superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036831", "name" "HNS-dependent expression A superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00946" "Acid stress chaperone HdeA [hdeA]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF009564" "Acid-resistance protein HdeA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HNS-dependent expression A", "short" "HdeA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 281, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 228, "sets" 0, "proteins" 228, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 160}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024972", :literature {"PUB00013252" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Masuda N" "Church GM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
