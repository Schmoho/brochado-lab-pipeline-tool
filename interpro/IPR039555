{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TraF protein undergoes proteolytic processing associated with export. The 19 amino acids at the amino terminus of the polypeptides appear to constitute a typical membrane leader peptide - not included in this family, while the remainder of the molecule is predicted to be primarily hydrophilic in character [[cite:PUB00034397]]. F plasmid TraF and TraH are required for F pilus assembly and F plasmid transfer, and they are both localised to the outer membrane in the presence of the complete F transfer region, especially TraV, the putative anchor [[cite:PUB00089815]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TrbB is closely related to TraF which is somewhat longer, lacks the cysteine motif and is apparently not functional as a disulfide bond isomerase.
