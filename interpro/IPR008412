The expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP) is normally restricted to mineralised connective tissues of bones and teeth; it is thought to be responsible for nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals. BSP also displays a high affinity for calcium ions. The mature protein has a molecular weight of around 33kDa and consists predominantly of Glu and Gly residues. It is subject to extensive post-translational modification, and is predominantly phosphorylated at Ser residues. Post-translational modifications can also cause BSP to act as an inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal formation. Ectopic expression of BSP occurs in various lesions, including oral and extraoral carcinomas, in which it has been associated both with the formation of microcrystalline deposits and with the metastasis of cancer cells to bone. The expression of this protein may be altered with the cancer secretome [[cite:PUB00011260], [cite:PUB00099948], [cite:PUB00099946]]. It has also been related to osteoarthritis [[cite:PUB00099947]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05432" "Bone sialoprotein II (BSP-II)"}, "panther" {"PTHR10345" "BONE SIALOPROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Integrin-binding sialoprotein", "short" "IBSP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 13, "proteomes" 429, "taxa" 1505, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 711, "sets" 0, "proteins" 531, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 396}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008412", :literature {"PUB00011259" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kim RH" "Shapiro HS" "Li JJ" "Wrana JL" "Sodek J."], "ISO_journal" "Matrix Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0945-053X(94)90027-2", "medline_journal" "Matrix Biol", "title" "Characterization of the human bone sialoprotein (BSP) gene and its promoter sequence.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "31-40", "volume" "14", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8061918}, "PUB00011260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Sasaguri K" "Ganss B" "Sodek J" "Chen JK."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
