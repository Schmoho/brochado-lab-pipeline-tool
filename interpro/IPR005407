{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>TASK is a member of the TWIK-related (two P-domain) K<sup>+</sup>channel family identified in human tissues [[cite:PUB00001308]]. It is widely distributed, being particularly abundant in the pancreas and placenta, but it is also found in the brain, heart, lung and kidney. Its amino acid identity to TWIK-1 and TREK-1 is rather low, being about 25-28%. However, it is thought to share the same topology of four TM segments, with two P-domains. TASK is very sensitive to variations in extracellular pH in the physiological range, changing from fully-open to closed in approximately 0.5 pH units around pH 7.4. Thus, it may well be a biological sensor of external pH variations.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Potassium channel subfamily K member 9 (KCNK9, also known as TASK3) is a pH-dependent, voltage-insensitive, background potassium channel protein [[cite:PUB00067998], [cite:PUB00067999]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01585" "TASK3CHANNEL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Potassium channel subfamily K member 9", "short" "KCNK9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 544, "taxa" 1895, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2455, "sets" 0, "proteins" 714, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 497}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005407", :literature {"PUB00067999" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Vega-Saenz de Miera E" "Lau DH" "Zhadina M" "Pountney D" "Coetzee WA" "Rudy B."], "ISO_journal" "J.
