{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Perviscerokinin neuropeptides are found in the abdominal perisympathetic organs of insects. They mediate visceral muscle contractile activity (myotropic activity). CAPA, which are in the periviscerokinin and pyrokinin peptide families, has potential medical importance. This is due to its myotropic effects on, for example, heart muscles and due to its occurrence in the Ixodoidea (ticks), which are important vectors in the transmission of many animal diseases [[cite:PUB00043388]]. These peptides also have a strong diuretic or anti-diuretic effect, suggesting they have significant medical implications [[cite:PUB00043389]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08259" "Periviscerokinin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Periviscerokinin", "short" "Periviscerokinin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 25, "proteomes" 61, "taxa" 847, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 412, "sets" 0, "proteins" 369, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 114}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013231", :literature {"PUB00043388" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Christie AE."], "ISO_journal" "Gen.
