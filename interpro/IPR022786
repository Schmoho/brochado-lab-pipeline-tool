{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Geminin and multicilin belong to the geminin family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geminin inhibits DNA replication by preventing the incorporation of MCM complex into prereplication complex, and is degraded during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. It has been proposed that geminin inhibits DNA replication during S, G2, and M phases and that geminin destruction at the metaphase-anaphase transition permits replication in the succeeding cell cycle [[cite:PUB00013135]]. The family also includes multicilin, which is required for multiciliate cell differentiation in diverse tissues [[cite:PUB00059235]]. It acts by promoting transcription of genes required for multiciliate cell formation, including FoxJ1 and genes mediating centriole assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multicilin (also known as Idas) is required for multiciliate cell differentiation in diverse tissues [[cite:PUB00059235]]. Multicilin coordinately promotes cell cycle exit, centriole assembly, and FoxJ1 expression [[cite:PUB00070887]]. It can form heterodimer with Geminin [[cite:PUB00070887]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1uii", "name" "Crystal structure of Geminin coiled-coil domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07412" "Geminin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Geminin/Multicilin", "short" "Geminin/Multicilin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 22, "proteomes" 904, "taxa" 3685, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2117, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1425}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022786", :literature {"PUB00059235" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Stubbs JL" "Vladar EK" "Axelrod JD" "Kintner C."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
