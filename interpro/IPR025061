{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diedel (die) was identified as an insect immune response protein. It is up-regulated after a septic injury and may act as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00078735]]. Its homologues can be found in Drosophila and Acyrtosiphon pisum. Interestingly, the orthologues of the die gene are present in the genome of insect DNA viruses of the Baculoviridae and Ascoviridae families. The viral homologues suppress the immune deficiency  (IMD) pathway in Drosophila [[cite:PUB00078736]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3zzo", "name" "Crystal structure of the CG11501 protein in P212121 spacegroup"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13164" "Diedel"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diedel", "short" "Diedel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 8, "proteomes" 58, "taxa" 384, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 189, "sets" 0, "proteins" 189, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 114}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025061", :literature {"PUB00078735" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Coste F" "Kemp C" "Bobezeau V" "Hetru C" "Kellenberger C" "Imler JL" "Roussel A."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS ONE", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033416", "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Crystal structure of Diedel, a marker of the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "e33416", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22442689}, "PUB00078736" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Lamiable O" "Kellenberger C" "Kemp C" "Troxler L" "Pelte N" "Boutros M" "Marques JT" "Daeffler L" "Hoffmann JA" "Roussel A" "Imler JL."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
