{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of plant root hair defective 3 (RHD3) protein and its homologues from other eukaryotes. RHD3 is a conserved protein with GTP-binding motifs that is implicated in the control of vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi compartments [[cite:PUB00011441]] and is also involved in homotypic ER membrane fusion, being classified as a dynamin-like GTPase together with its homologues Sey1 and atlastin [[cite:PUB00098270]]. It is required for appropriate root and root hair cells enlargement [[cite:PUB00011441]]. It may play a role in cell wall biosynthesis and actin organisation [[cite:PUB00064782], [cite:PUB00064783]]. Its homologue from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sey1, mediates homotypic ER fusion [[cite:PUB00098270], [cite:PUB00053138]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45923" "PROTEIN SEY1"}, "hamap" {"MF_03109" "Protein SEY1 [SEY1]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RHD3/Sey1", "short" "RHD3/Sey1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1586, "taxa" 4855, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4946, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4941, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3128}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
