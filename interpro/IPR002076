Structurally, they seem to be formed of three sections: a N-terminal region with two transmembrane domains, a central hydrophilic loop and a C-terminal region that contains from one to three transmembrane domains. Members of this family are involved in long chain fatty acid elongation systems that produce the 26-carbon precursors for ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis [[cite:PUB00002856]]. Yeast ELO3 ([swissprot:P40319]) affects plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity, and may act on a glucose-signalling pathway that controls the expression of several genes that are transcriptionally regulated by glucose such as PMA1 [[cite:PUB00002271]]. It plays an important role in lipotoxic cell death induced by oleic acid through maintaining a balanced fatty acid composition in the plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00097860]]. Mammalian ELOVLs are also associated with known pathologies. ELOVL1 catalyses elongation of saturated and monounsaturated C22-C26-VLCFAs, and dominant mutations cause ichthyosis, hypomyelination of the central white matter that leads to spastic paraplegia and central nystagmus and optic atrophy [[cite:PUB00097863]], dominant ELOVL4 mutations cause a juvenile macular dystrophy (Stargardt disease-3) and Elovl4 knockout mice die soon after birth due to a deficiency in skin barrier formation. Studies in Elovl6-null mice have revealed that ELOVL6 is involved in an obesity-induced insulin resistance and ELOVL7 is involved in prostate cancer growth [[cite:PUB00097862]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01151" "GNS1/SUR4 family"}, "panther" {"PTHR11157" "FATTY ACID ACYL TRANSFERASE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ELO family", "short" "ELO_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 248, "proteomes" 2658, "taxa" 9455, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 25966, "sets" 0, "proteins" 25239, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16551}, "pathways" 264}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00914", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00914"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1376", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1376"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
