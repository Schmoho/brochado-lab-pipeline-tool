{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family all have a C-terminal SPASM domain ([interpro:IPR023885]), a region usually found as a C-terminal second 4Fe-4S domain of radical SAM domain proteins. A majority of rSAM/SPASM proteins modify ribosomally produced peptides. In a few members of this family, the key Cys residues of the radical SAM domain have been lost, making this a pseudo-rSAM family. Members of this family are restricted so far to Haloarchaea, always occur next a member of family [interpro:IPR023976], and are often accompanied by another rSAM/SPASM domain protein. The function of this two or three gene cassette is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04347" "TIGR04347 family pseudo-SAM/SPASM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pseudo-rSAM protein/SPASM domain protein", "short" "Pseudo_SAM_Halo"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 57, "taxa" 357, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 261, "sets" 0, "proteins" 261, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 231}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1065", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1065"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027626", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017200", "name" "Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein E-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR011843", "name" "Coenzyme PQQ biosynthesis protein E, bacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023913", "name" "Mycofactocin maturase MftC", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR023992", "name" "Pre-heme d1 synthase NirJ", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026344", "name" "SynChlorMet cassette radical SAM/SPASM protein ScmE", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026346", "name" "SynChlorMet cassette radical SAM/SPASM protein ScmF", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026404", "name" "Radical SAM enzyme, rSAM/lipoprotein system", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR026482", "name" "Nif11-class peptide radical SAM maturase 3", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027570", "name" "GeoRSP system radical SAM/SPASM protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027583", "name" "Radical SAM/SPASM domain protein, ACGX system", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027626", "name" "Pseudo-rSAM protein/SPASM domain protein", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR027633", "name" "Putative heme D1 biosynthesis radical SAM protein NirJ2", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR034479", "name" "Alternative heme biosynthesis C (AhbC-like)", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR023930", "name" "Putative heme d1 biosynthesis protein, NirJ1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR030894", "name" "Fe-coproporphyrin III synthase AhbC, Proteobacteria type", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR034480", "name" "Heme carboxy lyase-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
