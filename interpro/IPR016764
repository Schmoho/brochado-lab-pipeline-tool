{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents a methyltransferase Mtx subunit X, also referred to as methanogenesis marker protein Mmp4/MtxX [[cite:PUB00106733]]. The exact function is unknown, but likely is linked to methanogenesis or a process closely linked to it. Some members have been suggested to be a methyltransferase, based on the proximity of its gene to genes of the multi-subunit complex, N5-methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin--coenzyme M methyltransferase. That context is not conserved, however. The family shows similarity to various phosphate acyltransferases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03270" "methanogenesis marker protein Mmp4/MtxX"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF019709" "Methyltransferase Mtx, subunit X"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methyltransferase Mtx subunit X", "short" "MeTrfase_MtxX_xsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 69, "taxa" 569, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 545, "sets" 0, "proteins" 544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 472}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0722"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
