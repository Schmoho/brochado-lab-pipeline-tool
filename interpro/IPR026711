{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein male-specific lethal-1 (Msl-1) is a component of a multisubunit histone acetyltransferase complex (MSL). The MSL complex has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity with specificity towards histone H4 lysine 16 [[cite:PUB00062203]]. In fruit fly, the MSL proteins are essential for elevating transcription of the single X chromosome in the male (X chromosome dosage compensation). It has been shown that Msl-1 is associated with hundreds of discrete sites along the length of the X chromosome in males and not in females, and is also associated with 10-20 autosomal sites in males in fruit fly [[cite:PUB00061697]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans the MSL complex has the same specificity for acetylating lysine 16 on histone H4, but in contrast to the Drosophila complex, the hMSL complex targets all chromosomes in vivo [[cite:PUB00062204]]. In mammals the Msl-1 homologue is also known as hampin [[cite:PUB00062205]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21656" "MALE-SPECIFIC LETHAL-1 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein male-specific lethal-1", "short" "Msl-1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 818, "taxa" 3339, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1571, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1571, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1019}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2064", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2064"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026711", :literature {"PUB00061697" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Palmer MJ" "Mergner VA" "Richman R" "Manning JE" "Kuroda MI" "Lucchesi JC."], "ISO_journal" "Genetics", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genetics", "title" "The male-specific lethal-one (msl-1) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a novel protein that associates with the X chromosome in males.", "year" 1993, "raw_pages" "545-57", "volume" "134", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8325488}, "PUB00062203" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Smith ER" "Pannuti A" "Gu W" "Steurnagel A" "Cook RG" "Allis CD" "Lucchesi JC."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
