{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>SoxY is encoded by one of the genes in the sulphur oxidizing gene cluster of alpha-proteobacteria. In the sulphur oxidation process, SoxY (which covalently binds sulphur) and SoxZ (which chelates sulphur) combine with each other to form the SoxYZ complex. The conserved cysteine residue in the sulphate-binding motif [(V/I)KV(T/S)(V/I)GGC] at the C terminus of SoxY is involved in forming a covalent S-S linkage with the sulphate ion to form SoxY-thiocysteine-S-sulphate, the first covalently bound sulphur adduct in sulphur anion oxidation by the proteins of the sox operon [[cite:PUB00035939], [cite:PUB00035940]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>SoxY is a sulfate carrier protein with the GGCGG ir GGCG swinging arm C-terminal sequence.
