{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonuclease kappa is an endoribonuclease which preferentially cleaves ApU and ApG phosphodiester bonds. It hydrolyses UpU bonds at a lower rate [[cite:PUB00061774]]. Its Ceratitis capitata homologue, also known as Cc RNase, exhibits ribonucleolytic activity against poly(C) and poly(U) synthetic substrates, as well as rRNA [[cite:PUB00062232]]. RNase K (also known as V-type proton ATPase subunit f) regulates the activity of vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) which is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and required at an early stage of receptor-mediated endocytosis [[cite:PUB00099348], [cite:PUB00100257]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31733" "RIBONUCLEASE KAPPA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease kappa", "short" "RNase_K"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 790, "taxa" 3475, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1714, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1714, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1132}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026770", :literature {"PUB00061774" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Economopoulou MA" "Fragoulis EG" "Sideris DC."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm718", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Molecular cloning and characterization of the human RNase kappa, an ortholog of Cc RNase.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "6389-98", "volume" "35", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17881363}, "PUB00062232" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Rampias TN" "Sideris DC" "Fragoulis EG."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkg414", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Cc RNase: the Ceratitis capitata ortholog of a novel highly conserved protein family in metazoans.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "3092-100", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12799437}, "PUB00099348" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wang L" "Wu D" "Robinson CV" "Wu H" "Fu TM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Structures of a Complete Human V-ATPase Reveal Mechanisms of Its Assembly.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "501-511.e3", "volume" "80", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33065002}, "PUB00100257" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Perreira JM" "Aker AM" "Savidis G" "Chin CR" "McDougall WM" "Portmann JM" "Meraner P" "Smith MC" "Rahman M" "Baker RE" "Gauthier A" "Franti M" "Brass AL."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "RNASEK Is a V-ATPase-Associated Factor Required for Endocytosis and the Replication of Rhinovirus, Influenza A Virus, and Dengue Virus.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "850-63", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26212330}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0004521", "name" "RNA endonuclease activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0090304", "name" "nucleic acid metabolic process", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026770", "name" "Ribonuclease kappa", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
