Although this entry contains CofH/subunit2 of coenzyme F(420) biosynthesis it appears to hit genomes more broadly than just the subset that make coenzyme F(420), so that narrower group is being built as a separate family ([interpro:IPR019940]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6xig", "name" "X-ray crystal structure of MqnE from Pedobacter heparinus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00343" "aminofutalosine synthase (mqnE-like)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00423" "CofH family radical SAM protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FO synthase, subunit 2", "short" "FO_synthase_su2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2779, "taxa" 11324, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21767, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21745, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16373}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
