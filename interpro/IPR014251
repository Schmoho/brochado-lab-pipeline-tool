{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents LonB, a paralog of the ATP-dependent protease La (LonA, [interpro:IPR004815]). LonB proteins are unassigned peptidases belonging to the MEROPS peptidase family S16 (lon protease family, clan SJ) and are found strictly, and almost universally, in endospore-forming bacteria. This protease was shown, in Bacillus subtilis, to be expressed specifically in the forespore during sporulation, under control of sigmaF [[cite:PUB00034583]]. The lonB gene, despite being located immediately upstream of lonA, was shown to be monocistronic. LonB appears to be involved in the post-translation control of sigmaH, but lonB mutation did not produce an obvious sporulation defect under the conditions tested [[cite:PUB00034584]]. Note that additional paralogs of LonA and LonB occur in the Clostridium lineage and these are excluded from this entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02902" "ATP-dependent protease LonB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation protease LonB", "short" "Spore_LonB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 650, "taxa" 1956, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1872, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1872, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1374}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
