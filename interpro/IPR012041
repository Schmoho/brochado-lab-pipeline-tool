{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes small CPxCG-related zinc finger archaeal proteins, which are thought to bind DNA and to be potential transcriptional regulators. These zinc fingers are characterised by the specific CPxCG pattern (variants CPxCx and CxxCG) and a second Cys/His pattern potentially more general, being 7-40 residues apart from each other. This family includes Nif-regulating protein A (Q8PW88) which contains the patterns CxxCG and HxxxH (the latter is unique to this protein and located 24 residues away from the CxxCG motif) to form the zinc finger motif. It is a DNA-binding protein involved in nitrogen regulation as it enhances the transcription of the nitrogen fixation (nif) operon under nitrogen-limited conditions [[cite:PUB00095525]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19769" "CPxCG-related zinc finger"}, "panther" {"PTHR42195" "UCP015877 FAMILY PROTEIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015877" "Uncharacterised Zn-finger protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CPxCG-like zinc finger protein", "short" "Znf_CPxCG-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 213, "taxa" 1339, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1468, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1248}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012041", :literature {"PUB00095525" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Weidenbach K" "Ehlers C" "Schmitz RA."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "The transcriptional activator NrpA is crucial for inducing nitrogen fixation in Methanosarcina mazeiÂ Go1 under nitrogen-limited conditions.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "3507-22", "volume" "281", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24930989}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012041", "name" "CPxCG-like zinc finger protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 57, "alignment:full" 207}}}
