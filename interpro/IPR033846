{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes N-acetylcysteine deacetylase (also known as YxeP protein) from Bacillus subtilis (MEROPS identifier M20.015) and its close homologues. YxeP probably catalyses the deacetylation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to acetate and cysteine. It is involved in a S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) degradation pathway that allows B.subtilis to grow on 2SC as a sole sulfur source, via its metabolization to cysteine [[cite:PUB00103903]]. N-acetyl-L-cysteine deacetylase SndA is involved in a cysteine salvage pathway from S-alkylcysteine, catalysing the last step in this pathway. This pathway is likely important in the catabolism of alkylated cysteine generated by proteolysis of alkylated glutathione formed in the detoxification of a wide range of electrophiles [[cite:PUB00103904]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05669" "M20 Peptidase aminoacyclase-1 YxeP-like proteins, including YxeP, YtnL, YjiB and HipO2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YxeP peptidase-like", "short" "YxeP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 48, "taxa" 532, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 649, "sets" 0, "proteins" 649, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 403}, "pathways" 22}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
