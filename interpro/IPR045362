{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Contractile injection systems (CISs) are cell-puncturing nanodevices that share ancestry with contractile tail bacteriophages. This entry represents the spike tip protein from a extracellular CIS present in bacteria. This protein family includes the Pvc10 (the homologue of T4 gp5.4). This monomeric protein was part of a CryoEM structure and although not resolved at atomic resolution in the map, it was observed to form the sharp conical tip on the Pvc8 spike [[cite:PUB00097484]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19267" "Contractile injection system spike tip protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Contractile injection system spike tip protein", "short" "CIS_spike_tip"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 84, "taxa" 677, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 415, "sets" 0, "proteins" 414, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 327}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045362", :literature {"PUB00097484" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jiang F" "Li N" "Wang X" "Cheng J" "Huang Y" "Yang Y" "Yang J" "Cai B" "Wang YP" "Jin Q" "Gao N."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Cryo-EM Structure and Assembly of an Extracellular Contractile Injection System.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "370-383.e15", "volume" "177", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30905475}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045362", "name" "Contractile injection system spike tip protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 90}}}
