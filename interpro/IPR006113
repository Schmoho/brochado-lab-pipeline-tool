{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1.44]) (6PGD) is a key enzyme that produces NADPH by converting 6-phospho D-gluconolactone to D-ribulose 5-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) [[cite:PUB00002112], [cite:PUB00001132]]. NADPH provides the major reducing power required for lipid production and protecting the cell against oxidative stress. 6PGD has been extensively studied with respect to kinetics, regulation, role in pentose-shunt production of NADPH and lipogenesis, and population genetics [[cite:PUB00073768]]. 6PGD is associated with several human disorders including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The structure of budding yeast 6PGD (also known as Gnd1) has been revealed [[cite:PUB00043231]].</p>\n\n<p>Prokaryotic and eukaryotic 6PGD are proteins of about 470 amino acids whose sequence are highly conserved [[cite:PUB00003806]]. The protein is a homodimer in which the monomers act independently [[cite:PUB00001132]]: each contains a large, mainly α-helical domain and a smaller β-α-β domain, containing a mixed parallel and anti-parallel 6-stranded β sheet [[cite:PUB00043231], [cite:PUB00001132]]. NADP is bound in a cleft in the small domain, the substrate binding in an adjacent pocket [[cite:PUB00001132]].</p>\n\n<p>Bacillus subtilis contains three classes of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases (6PGD), including Gnd (YqjI), GntZ and YqeC (truncated 6PGD). Gnd (YqjI) and GntZ are included in this entry. YgjiI is NADP+ dependent, while GntZ and YqeC are NAD+-dependent [[cite:PUB00073769]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fqz", "name" "Plasmodium falciparum 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in its apo form, in complex with its cofactor NADP+ and in complex with its substrate 6-phosphogluconate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013328", "name" "6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR008927", "name" "6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase-like, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000109" "Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00873" "decarboxylating NADP(+)-dependent phosphogluconate dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating", "short" "6PGDH_Gnd/GntZ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7000, "taxa" 26133, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24392, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24235, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18134}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1520", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1520"} {"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"} {"accession" "GenProp1438", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1438"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
