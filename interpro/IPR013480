The role of NifX in cofactor biosynthesis is not fully understood, though it appears to be associated with mature FeMo-Co and may be involved in the addition of heterometal and/or homocitrate [[cite:PUB00016259]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1p90", "name" "The Three-dimensional Structure of the Core Domain of NafY from Azotobacter vinelandii determined at 1.8 resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036105", "name" "Dinitrogenase iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02663" "nitrogen fixation protein NifX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogen fixation protein NifX", "short" "NifX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 409, "taxa" 2204, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1606, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1606, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1336}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0029", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0029"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013480", :literature {"PUB00016259" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Rangaraj P" "Ruttimann-Johnson C" "Shah VK" "Ludden PW."], "ISO_journal" "J.
