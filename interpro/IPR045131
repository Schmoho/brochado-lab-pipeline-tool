{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family contain the CDGSH-type zinc finger. Interestingly, they do not contain any zinc ions, but rather iron contained in a 2Fe-2S (iron-sulfur) cluster. The conserved sequence C-X-C-X(2)-(S/T)-X(3)-P-X-C-D-G-(S/A/T)-H is a defining feature of this unique family of proteins and is likely involved in iron binding [[cite:PUB00035840]]. They play an important part in the proliferation of breast cancer cells and tumour formation [[cite:PUB00098104]]. CISD1 (also known as mitoNEET) is a mitochondrial protein that plays an important part in mitochondrial bioenergetics. It also plays a part in insulin regulation, inflammation and autophagy [[cite:PUB00098101]]. CISD2 (also known as NAF-1) can be found in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial outer membrane [[cite:PUB00098103]]. It regulates autophagy [[cite:PUB00098102]].</p>\n\n<p>Mutations of the CISD2 gene cause Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2), a rare disorder characterized by juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with optic atrophy [[cite:PUB00098102]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7p0p", "name" "NAF-1 bound to M1 molecule"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13680" "CDGSH IRON-SULFUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 1/2", "short" "CISD1/2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1301, "taxa" 5279, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3201, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3201, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2185}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
