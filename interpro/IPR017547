{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Csf3 family of Cas proteins. Members of this family show up near CRISPR repeats in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270, Azoarcus sp. (strain EbN1), and Rhodoferax ferrireducens (strain DSM 15236/ATCC BAA-621/T118). In the latter two species, the CRISPR/cas locus is found on a plasmid. This family is one of several characteristic of a type of cas gene cluster we designate Aferr after A. ferrooxidans, where it is both chromosomal and the only type of cas gene cluster found. The gene is designated csf3 (CRISPR/cas Subtype as in A. ferrooxidans protein 3), as it lies third closest to the repeats.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic defence mechanism against foreign genetic elements.
