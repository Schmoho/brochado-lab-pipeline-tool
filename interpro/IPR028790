{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Molecular chaperone MKKS (also known as BBS6) is a chaperonin-like protein that is involved in folding newly synthesised polypeptides [[cite:PUB00069287]]. As part of the BBS/CCT complex mediates BBSome assembly, which is involved in regulating ciliogenesis and transport of vesicles to the cilia [[cite:PUB00069285]]. During mitosis, MKKS localises throughout the pericentriolar material (PCM) and the intercellular bridge. It is required for cytokinesis [[cite:PUB00069288]]. It may play a role in protein processing in limb, cardiac and reproductive system development [[cite:PUB00101097]].</p>\n\n<p>Mutations in MKKS gene cause McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS), which is autosomal recessive developmental disorder [[cite:PUB00069287]]. Mutations in MKKS gene also cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome 6 (BBS6), which is characterised by usually severe pigmentary retinopathy, early-onset obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, renal malformation and mental retardation [[cite:PUB00069288]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027413", "name" "GroEL-like equatorial domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46787" "SYNDROMES PUTATIVE CHAPERONIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Molecular chaperone MKKS", "short" "MKKS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 754, "taxa" 2818, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1169, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1169, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 832}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028790", :literature {"PUB00069285" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Seo S" "Baye LM" "Schulz NP" "Beck JS" "Zhang Q" "Slusarski DC" "Sheffield VC."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
