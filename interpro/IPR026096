{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of receptor-transporting proteins (RTP1, 2, 3, 4, 5). RTP5 is also known as CXXC-type zinc finger protein 11 (CXXC11). Mammalian RTP1 and RTP2 are accessory proteins to mammalian odorant receptors (ORs) and play significant roles in the translocation of ORs to the plasma membrane. They are expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons and facilitate OR trafficking to the cell-surface membrane and ligand-induced responses in heterologous cells [[cite:PUB00060015], [cite:PUB00103703]]. The functions of RTP3, RTP4 and RTP5 are not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR14402" "RECEPTOR TRANSPORTING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Receptor-transporting protein", "short" "R-trans_p"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 465, "taxa" 2043, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2115, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2115, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1395}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026096", :literature {"PUB00103703" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Yu T" "Su X" "Pan Y" "Zhuang H."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Receptor-transporting protein (RTP) family members play divergent roles in the functional expression of odorant receptors.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "e0179067", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28586385}, "PUB00060015" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Saito H" "Kubota M" "Roberts RW" "Chi Q" "Matsunami H."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2004.11.021", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "RTP family members induce functional expression of mammalian odorant receptors.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "679-91", "volume" "119", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15550249}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR026096", "name" "Receptor-transporting protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
