{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme is also called serine deaminase. L-serine dehydratase converts serine into pyruvate in the gluconeogenesis pathway from serine.  This enzyme is comprised of a single chain in Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and several other species, but has separate alpha and beta chains in Bacillus subtilis and related species. The beta and alpha chains are homologous to the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively, but are rather deeply branched in a UPGMA tree. This enzyme requires iron and dithiothreitol for activation<i>in vitro</i>, and is a predicted 4Fe-4S protein. Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa have two copies of this protein [[cite:PUB00016056], [cite:PUB00077265], [[cite:PUB00016056]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00720" "L-serine ammonia-lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Iron-sulphur-dependent L-serine dehydratase single chain form", "short" "Fe-S_L-Ser_mono"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4683, "taxa" 17460, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22260, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22260, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17439}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
