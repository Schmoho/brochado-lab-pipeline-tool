{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) mainly from phages such as bacteriophage T4. It repairs 3'-OH/5'-PO4 nicks in duplex RNA or RNA:DNA hybrid in which the broken 3'-OH strand is RNA [[cite:PUB00095679], [cite:PUB00095678]]. This process comprises three steps: in the first one, the RNA ligase reacts with ATP in the absence of nucleic acid to form a covalent ligase-AMP intermediate releasing pyrophosphate; in the second the ligase-AMP binds to the nicked duplex nucleic acid and transfers the adenylate to the 5'-PO4 terminus to form an adenylylated nicked intermediate and in the third step the RNA ligase directs the attack of the nick 3'-OH on the 5'-phosphoanhydride linkage, resulting in a repaired 3' - 5' phosphodiester and release of AMP [[cite:PUB00095678]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04150" "RNA ligase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA ligase 2, viral", "short" "Rnl2_vir"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 48, "taxa" 809, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 562, "sets" 0, "proteins" 562, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
