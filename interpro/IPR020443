Structurally, IL-10 is a protein of about 160 amino acids that contains four conserved cysteines involved in disulphide bonds [[cite:PUB00005262]]. IL-10 is highly similar to the Epstein-Barr virus (strain GD1) (HHV-4) (Human herpesvirus 4) BCRF1 protein which inhibits the synthesis of gamma-interferon and to Equid herpesvirus 2 (Equine herpesvirus 2) protein E7. It is also similar, but to a lesser degree, with human protein mda-7 [[cite:PUB00004497]], a protein which has antiproliferative properties in human melanoma cells. Mda-7 only contains two of the four cysteines of IL-10.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6gg1", "name" "Structure of PROSS-edited human interleukin 24"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012352", "name" "Interleukin-10, additional helical", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48482" "INTERLEUKIN-19-RELATED"}, "smart" {"SM00188" "Interleukin-10 family"}, "pfam" {"PF00726" "Interleukin 10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-10/19/20/24/26", "short" "IL-10/19/20/24/26"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 18, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 653, "taxa" 2393, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3074, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3030, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2030}, "pathways" 15}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020443", :literature {"PUB00005262" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zdanov A" "Schalk-Hihi C" "Gustchina A" "Tsang M" "Weatherbee J" "Wlodawer A."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00193-9", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of interleukin-10 reveals the functional dimer with an unexpected topological similarity to interferon gamma.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "591-601", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8590020}, "PUB00004497" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Jiang H" "Lin JJ" "Su ZZ" "Goldstein NI" "Fisher PB."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Subtraction hybridization identifies a novel melanoma differentiation associated gene, mda-7, modulated during human melanoma differentiation, growth and progression.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "2477-86", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8545104}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020443", "name" "Interleukin-10/19/20/24/26", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR000098", "name" "Interleukin-10", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR020421", "name" "Interleukin-19", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR020442", "name" "Interleukin-20", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR020444", "name" "Interleukin-24", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 3, "alignment:full" 1820}}}
