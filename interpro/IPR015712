{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the beta subunit (also referred to as subunit 2) from DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. RNA polymerases catalyse the DNA dependent polymerization of RNA. Prokaryotes contain a single RNA polymerase compared to three in eukaryotes (not including mitochondrial and chloroplast polymerases). Each RNA polymerase complex contains two related members of this family, in each case they are the two largest subunits. The clamp is a mobile structure that grips DNA during elongation [[cite:PUB00011749], [cite:PUB00079994], [cite:PUB00079995], [cite:PUB00013986], [cite:PUB00028105], [cite:PUB00010734], [cite:PUB00080226], [cite:PUB00025919], [cite:PUB00022053]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>DNA-directed RNA polymerases [ec:2.7.7.6] (also known as  DNA-dependent RNA polymerases) are responsible for the polymerisation of ribonucleotides into a sequence complementary to the template DNA. In eukaryotes, there are three different forms of DNA-directed RNA polymerases transcribing different sets of genes. Most RNA polymerases are multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits. The core RNA polymerase complex consists of five subunits (two alpha, one beta, one beta-prime and one omega) and is sufficient for transcription elongation and termination but is unable to initiate transcription. Transcription initiation from promoter elements requires a sixth, dissociable subunit called a sigma factor, which reversibly associates with the core RNA polymerase complex to form a holoenzyme [[cite:PUB00000061]]. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a \"crab claw\"-like structure with an internal channel running along the full length [[cite:PUB00033173]]. The key functional sites of the enzyme, as defined by mutational and cross-linking analysis, are located on the inner wall of this channel.</p>\n\n<p>RNA synthesis follows after the attachment of RNA polymerase to a specific site, the promoter, on the template DNA strand.  The RNA synthesis process continues until a termination sequence is reached. The RNA product, which is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, is known as the primary transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic nuclei contain three distinct types of RNA polymerases that differ in the RNA they synthesise:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RNA polymerase I: located in the nucleoli, synthesises precursors of most ribosomal RNAs.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase II: occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises mRNA precursors.</li>\n<li>RNA polymerase III: also occurs in the nucleoplasm, synthesises the precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, the tRNAs, and a variety of other small nuclear and cytosolic RNAs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Eukaryotic cells are also known to contain separate mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA polymerases. Eukaryotic RNA polymerases, whose molecular masses vary in size from 500 to 700kDa, contain two non-identical large (>100kDa) subunits and an array of up to 12 different small (less than 50kDa) subunits.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014724", "name" "RNA polymerase Rpb2, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042107", "name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, beta subunit, external 1 domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037033", "name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, subunit 2, hybrid-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037034", "name" "RNA polymerase Rpb2, domain 2 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00653" "RNA_pol_B_RPB2"}, "panther" {"PTHR20856" "DNA-DIRECTED RNA POLYMERASE I SUBUNIT 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-directed RNA polymerase, subunit 2", "short" "DNA-dir_RNA_pol_su2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1047, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12281, "taxa" 103449, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 148081, "sets" 0, "proteins" 147984, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 103645}, "pathways" 212}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
