{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Human Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3 (also known as NOR-1) mRNA has been detected in adult heart and skeletal muscle, as well as in foetal brain, indicating that its expression is not restricted to events that occur during neural development [[cite:PUB00006355]]; it plays a role in the regulation of proliferation, survival and differentiation of many different cell types and also in metabolism and inflammation. It mediates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, myeloid progenitor cell and type B pancreatic cells; promotes mitogen-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through transactivation of SKP2 promoter by binding a NBRE site [[cite:PUB00151512]]. It is a transcriptional activator that binds to regulatory elements in promoter regions in a cell- and response element (target)-specific manner [[cite:PUB00151511]] and induces gene expression by binding as monomers to the NR4A1 response element (NBRE) 5'-AAAAGGTCA-3' site and as homodimers to the Nur response element (NurRE) site in the promoter of their regulated target genes.</p>\n\n<p>It has been shown that in a skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, the EWS gene becomes fused to NR4A3 [[cite:PUB00006342]]. The chimaeric EWS-NOR gene encodes a EWS-NOR fusion protein in which the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of EWS is replaced by the entire NOR protein, comprising a long N-terminal domain, a central DNA binding domain and a C-terminal ligand-binding/dimerisation domain [[cite:PUB00006342]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands [[cite:PUB00015853]]. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner [[cite:PUB00004464], [cite:PUB00006168]]. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed 'orphan' receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035500", "name" "Nuclear hormone receptor-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01286" "NORNUCRECPTR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3", "short" "NR4A3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 498, "taxa" 1646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3831, "sets" 0, "proteins" 643, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 477}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003072", :literature {"PUB00006355" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Ohkura N" "Ito M" "Tsukada T" "Sasaki K" "Yamaguchi K" "Miki K."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
