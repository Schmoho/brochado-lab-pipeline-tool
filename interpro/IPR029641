{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The APC/C consists of thirteen different subunits and, in somatic cells, has two co-activators: Cdc20 and Cdh1 (also known as Fzr1), which associate with the APC/C core at defined stages of the cell cycle. APC/C is only active between metaphase and the end of the next G1 phase. During this time, APC/CCdc20 initiates anaphase and mitotic exit, while APC/CCdh1 contributes to mitotic exit and establishment of a stable G1 state [[cite:PUB00070570]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the APC/C subunit 16 [[cite:PUB00070571]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17256" "Anaphase-promoting complex, subunit 16"}, "panther" {"PTHR31564" "ANAPHASE-PROMOTING COMPLEX SUBUNIT 16"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 16", "short" "APC16"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 620, "taxa" 2162, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 936, "sets" 0, "proteins" 868, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 626}, "pathways" 62}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029641", :literature {"PUB00070570" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Bassermann F" "Eichner R" "Pagano M."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
