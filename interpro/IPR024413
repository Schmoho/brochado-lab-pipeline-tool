{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phage internal head proteins (IP) are proteins that are encoded by a bacteriophage and assembled into the mature virion inside the capsid head.  The most analogous characterised IP proteins are those of bacteriophage T4, which are known to be proteolytically processed during phage maturation, and then subsequently injected into the host cell during infection. The phiKZ_IP family consists of internal head proteins encoded by phiKZ-like phages.  Each phage encodes three to six members of this family [[cite:PUB00056038]].  Members of the family reside in the head [[cite:PUB00056039]] and are cleaved during phage maturation to separate an N-terminal propeptide from a C-terminal domain.  The C-terminal domain remains in the mature capsid.  The N-terminal propeptide domain is either mostly or completely removed from the mature capsid. In one case, an unrelated polypeptide is embedded in the propeptide and also remains in the mature capsid.  The phiKZ-like IP proteins are not discernibly homologous to the T4 IP proteins, and it is not known if the phiKZ-like IP proteins are injected into the host cell, or have some other function within the head.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12699" "phiKZ-like phage internal head proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage phiKZ, Orf92, internal head", "short" "Phage_phiKZ_Orf92_int-head"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 47, "taxa" 337, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 396, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024413", :literature {"PUB00056038" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Thomas JA" "Rolando MR" "Carroll CA" "Shen PS" "Belnap DM" "Weintraub ST" "Serwer P" "Hardies SC."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.04.004", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Characterization of Pseudomonas chlororaphis myovirus 201varphi2-1 via genomic sequencing, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "330-8", "volume" "376", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18474389}, "PUB00056039" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Lecoutere E" "Ceyssens PJ" "Miroshnikov KA" "Mesyanzhinov VV" "Krylov VN" "Noben JP" "Robben J" "Hertveldt K" "Volckaert G" "Lavigne R."], "ISO_journal" "Proteomics", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.200800727", "medline_journal" "Proteomics", "title" "Identification and comparative analysis of the structural proteomes of phiKZ and EL, two giant Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophages.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3215-9", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19526553}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024413", "name" "Bacteriophage phiKZ, Orf92, internal head", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 14, "alignment:full" 122}}}
