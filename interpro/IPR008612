{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several mating pheromone proteins from Euplotes octocarinatus. Cells of the ten mating types of the ciliate E. octocarinatus communicate by pheromones before they enter conjugation. The pheromones induce homotypic pairing when applied to mating types that do not secrete the same pheromone(s). Heterotypic pairs (i.e., those between cells of different mating types) are formed only when both mating types in a mixture secrete a pheromone that the other does not. The genetics of mating types is based on four codominant mating type alleles, each allele determining production of a different pheromone. The pheromones not only induce pair formation but also attract cells [[cite:PUB00011333]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05842" "Euplotes octocarinatus mating pheromone protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mating pheromone, Euplotes octocarinatus", "short" "Mating_pheromone_EUPOC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 13, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008612", :literature {"PUB00011333" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kuhlmann HW" "Brunen-Nieweler C" "Heckmann K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
