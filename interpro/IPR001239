{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of Kazal eukaryotic proteinase inhibitors, belongs to MEROPS inhibitor family I1, clan IA. They inhibit serine peptidases of the S1 family ([interpro:IPR001254]) [[cite:PUB00014133]]. They are restricted to the metazoa (arthropoda and chordata), and includes a single exception in the alveolata (apicomplexa). No members are found in nematodes, fungi or plants.</p>\n\n<p>Kazal inhibitors, which inhibit a number of serine proteinases (such as trypsin and elastase), belong to family of proteins that includes pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor; avian ovomucoid; acrosin inhibitor; and elastase inhibitor. These proteins contain between 1 and 7 Kazal-type inhibitor repeats [[cite:PUB00003203], [cite:PUB00000286]].</p>\n\n<p>The structure of the Kazal repeat includes a large quantity of extended chain, 2 short α-helices and a 3-stranded anti-parallel β sheet [[cite:PUB00003203]].The inhibitor makes 11 contacts with its enzyme substrate: unusually, 8 of these important residues are hypervariable [[cite:PUB00000286]]. Altering the enzyme-contact residues, and especially that of the active site bond, affects the the strength of inhibition and specificity of the inhibitor for particular serine proteinases [[cite:PUB00000286], [cite:PUB00000276]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036058", "name" "Kazal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00290" "KAZALINHBTR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteinase inhibitor I1, Kazal-type, metazoa", "short" "Prot_inh_Kazal-m"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 622, "taxa" 2431, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4352, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2176, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1536}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001239", :literature {"PUB00003203" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Williamson MP" "Marion D" "Wuthrich K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
