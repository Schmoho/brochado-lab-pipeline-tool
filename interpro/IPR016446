{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Reduced flavins participate in numerous biochemical processes. NAD(P)H-flavin oxiodoreductases (flavin reductases) catalyses the reduction of flavin by NAD(P)H. The representative member of this family, Frp (flavin reductase P), is a supplier of reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) to the bioluminescence reaction in Vibrio harveyi [[cite:PUB00070810], [cite:PUB00023654], [cite:PUB00070811]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oxygen-insensitive NADPH nitroreductase also belongs to this family.
