{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cupiennin are small cationic Î±-helical peptides from the venom of the ctenid spider Cupiennius salei which are characterized by high bactericidal as well as hemolytic activities [[cite:PUB00085225]]. Family members such as cupiennin 1a exert both cytolytic and antibacterial effects. The cytolytic activity of the cupiennin peptides depends primarily on the amphipathic N terminus, which is capable of inserting into the membrane, and is modulated by the C terminus via electrostatic interactions with the cell surface [[cite:PUB00048209]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17563" "Cupiennin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cupiennin", "short" "Cupiennin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 21, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035164", :literature {"PUB00085225" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kuhn-Nentwig L" "Sheynis T" "Kolusheva S" "Nentwig W" "Jelinek R."], "ISO_journal" "Toxicon", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.03.003", "medline_journal" "Toxicon", "title" "N-terminal aromatic residues closely impact the cytolytic activity of cupiennin 1a, a major spider venom peptide.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "177-86", "volume" "75", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23523532}, "PUB00048209" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Pukala TL" "Boland MP" "Gehman JD" "Kuhn-Nentwig L" "Separovic F" "Bowie JH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi062306+", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Solution structure and interaction of cupiennin 1a, a spider venom peptide, with phospholipid bilayers.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "3576-85", "volume" "46", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17319697}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042742", "name" "defense response to bacterium", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035164", "name" "Cupiennin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
