{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the family of nodulin 40 proteins. The soybean early nodulin 40 (ENOD40) mRNA contains two short overlapping ORFs; in vitro translation yields two peptides of 12 and 24 amino acids [[cite:PUB00017133]]. The putative role of the ENOD40 genes has been in favour of organogenesis, such as induction of the cortical cell divisions that lead to initiation of nodule primordia, in developing lateral roots and embryonic tissues. This supports the hypothesis for a role of ENOD40 in lateral organ development [[cite:PUB00017176]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08247" "ENOD40 protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Early nodulin 40", "short" "ENOD40"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 60, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013186", :literature {"PUB00017133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Rohrig H" "Schmidt J" "Miklashevichs E" "Schell J" "John M."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
