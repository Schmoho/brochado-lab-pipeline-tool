The structure is similar to that of a molybdenum cofactor carrier protein.This family belongs in the SLOG superfamily, circularly-permuted version of YspA famiy showing fusions to NAD utilization and ADP-ribosylation domains including NUDIX, NADAR and MACRO. Members of this family are predicted to function as sensors of nucleotide, nucleotide-derived ligands, or nucleic acids, which are potentially processed/modified by associating effectors [[cite:PUB00091021]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3imk", "name" "Crystal structure of Putative molybdenum carrier protein (YP_461806.1) from SYNTROPHUS ACIDITROPHICUS SB at 1.45 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12694" "Circularly permutated YpsA SLOG family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Circularly permutated YpsA SLOG", "short" "cpYpsA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 38, "proteomes" 331, "taxa" 2125, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1873, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1869, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1360}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024755", :literature {"PUB00091021" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Burroughs AM" "Zhang D" "Schaffer DE" "Iyer LM" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1267", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Comparative genomic analyses reveal a vast, novel network of nucleotide-centric systems in biological conflicts, immunity and signaling.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "10633-54", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26590262}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024755", "name" "Circularly permutated YpsA SLOG", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 31, "alignment:full" 379}}}
