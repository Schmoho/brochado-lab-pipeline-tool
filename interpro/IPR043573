{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of polyphosphoinositide phosphatases, including fungal Fig4 and its homologues from animals and plants. They contain a SAC (suppressor of actin) domain. Fig4 is part of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesising complex of yeast at the vacuole membrane [[cite:PUB00094208]] and is involved in regulating both the acute rise and subsequent fall in PI3,5P(2) levels [[cite:PUB00094209]].</p>\n\n<p>In Arabidopsis there are five Fig4 homologues, known as SAC1-5. They play an important role in vacuolar trafficking, vacuolar morphology and function in plants [[cite:PUB00071954]].</p>\n\n<p>In humans, mutations of the FIG4 gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 4J (CMT4J), a recessive demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system [[cite:PUB00094210]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR45738" "POLYPHOSPHOINOSITIDE PHOSPHATASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyphosphoinositide phosphatase Fig4-like", "short" "Fig4-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2591, "taxa" 10643, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9398, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9398, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4648}, "pathways" 43}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
