{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gas vesicles (GVs) are small, hollow, gas filled protein structures found in several cyanobacterial and archaebacterial microorganisms [[cite:PUB00000481], [cite:PUB00151155], [cite:PUB00151154], [cite:PUB00151157]]. They allow the positioning of the bacteria at the favourable depth for growth. Gas vesicles are hollow cylindrical tubes, closed by a hollow, conical cap at each end. Both the conical end caps and central cylinder are made up of 4-5 nm wide ribs that run at right angles to the long axis of the structure. Gas vesicles seem to be constituted of two different protein components, GvpA and GvpC. GvpA, a small protein of about 70 amino acid residues, is the main constituent of gas vesicles and form the essential core of the structure, while GvpC binds the exterior of the GV and provides additional structural reinforcement [[cite:PUB00151158]]. The sequence of GVPa is extremely well conserved. GvpJ and GvpM, two proteins encoded in the cluster of genes required for gas vesicle synthesis in the archaebacteria Halobacterium salinarum and Halobacterium mediterranei (Haloferax mediterranei), have been found [[cite:PUB00001807]] to be evolutionary related to GVPa. The exact function of these two proteins is not known, although they could be important for determining the shape determination gas vesicles. The N-terminal domain of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae protein GvpA/J is also related to GvpA.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00741" "Gas vesicle protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gas vesicle protein GvpA-like", "short" "Gas-vesicle_GvpA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 15, "proteomes" 854, "taxa" 3698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9656, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9655, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7262}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00207", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00207"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0460", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0460"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000638", :literature {"PUB00000481" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Walsby AE" "Hayes PK."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
