COMMD1 is a multifunctional protein that has been shown to participate in two apparently distinct activities, regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B and control of copper metabolism. The family is defined by the presence of a C-terminal motif termed COMM domain, which functions as an interface for protein-protein interactions. The proteins designated as COMMD or COMM domain containing 1-10 are extensively conserved in multicellular eukaryotic organisms [[cite:PUB00043133], [cite:PUB00043745]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR16231" "COMM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4-8 FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "COMM domain-containing protein 4/6/7/8", "short" "COMMD4/6/7/8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 996, "taxa" 4148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5152, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5152, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3522}, "pathways" 5}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047155", :literature {"PUB00043133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Burstein E" "Hoberg JE" "Wilkinson AS" "Rumble JM" "Csomos RA" "Komarck CM" "Maine GN" "Wilkinson JC" "Mayo MW" "Duckett CS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
