{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glyoxysomal malate synthases and one of two bacterial forms, designated malate synthase A.</p>\r\n<p>Malate synthase and isocitrate lyase are the two characteristic enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle. The glyoxylate cycle allows certain organisms, like plants and fungi, to derive their carbon requirements from two-carbon compounds, by bypassing the two carboxylation steps of the citric acid cycle [[cite:PUB00080574]]. Isocitrate lyase, first catalyzes the aldol cleavage of isocitrate to succinate (an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle) and glyoxylate. Then malate synthase catalyzes the condensation of acetyl CoA with glyoxylate to yield malate (another intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle) [[cite:PUB00080575]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3cuz", "name" "Atomic Resolution Structures of Escherichia coli and Bacillis anthracis Malate Synthase A: Comparison with Isoform G and Implications for Structure Based Drug Design"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011076", "name" "Malate synthase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR046363", "name" "Malate synthase, N-terminal and TIM-barrel domains", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00727" "malate_synt_A"}, "panther" {"PTHR42902" "MALATE SYNTHASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01344" "malate synthase A"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001363" "Malate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Malate synthase A", "short" "Malate_synthA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4328, "taxa" 16250, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16633, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16590, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12110}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1265", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1265"} {"accession" "GenProp1722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1722"} {"accession" "GenProp0023", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0023"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
