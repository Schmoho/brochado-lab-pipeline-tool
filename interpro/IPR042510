It is an inhibitor of PP2A, a tumour suppressor. CIP2A binds to PP2A and inhibits its phosphatase functions resulting in tumorigenic transformation of cells [[cite:PUB00093048], [cite:PUB00093049]]. CIP2A is overexpressed at a high frequency in a number of tumours and expression levels are independent markers for long-term outcomes in many of these tumours [[cite:PUB00093049]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23161" "PROTEIN CIP2A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein CIP2A", "short" "CIP2A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 929, "taxa" 3637, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1739, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1739, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1127}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042510", :literature {"PUB00093048" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Junttila MR" "Puustinen P" "Niemela M" "Ahola R" "Arnold H" "Bottzauw T" "Ala-aho R" "Nielsen C" "Ivaska J" "Taya Y" "Lu SL" "Lin S" "Chan EK" "Wang XJ" "Grenman R" "Kast J" "Kallunki T" "Sears R" "Kahari VM" "Westermarck J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "CIP2A inhibits PP2A in human malignancies.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "51-62", "volume" "130", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17632056}, "PUB00093049" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["De P" "Carlson J" "Leyland-Jones B" "Dey N."], "ISO_journal" "Oncotarget", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncotarget", "title" "Oncogenic nexus of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A): an oncoprotein with many hands.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "4581-602", "volume" "5", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25015035}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR042510", "name" "Protein CIP2A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
