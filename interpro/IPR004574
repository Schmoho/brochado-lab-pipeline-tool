{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>AlkB proteins are dioxygenases that repair alkylation damage to DNA and RNA [[cite:PUB00076916]]. The Escherichia coli alkB gene product protects against cell killing by S(N)2-alkylating agents through DNA repair by a novel direct reversal DNA repair mechanism: the oxidative demethylation of N1-methyladenine or N3-methylcytosine DNA lesions. This reaction occurs on both single- and double-stranded DNA, and requires AlkB-bound non-heme Fe(2+), O(2) and alpha-ketogluterate to oxidize the offending methyl group. This is followed by the release of succinate, CO(2) and formaldehyde, and the restoration of undamaged A or C in DNA [[cite:PUB00010126]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nine mammalian AlkB homologues exist (ALKBH1-8, FTO), but only a subset functions as DNA/RNA repair enzymes [[cite:PUB00076917]], and only ALKBH1 is included in this entry. In humans, ALKBH1 (ABH1) is responsible for the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine (f5C) in position 34 in mitochondrial tRNAMet [[cite:PUB00088328]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5xoi", "name" "The structure of OsALKBH1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037151", "name" "Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00568" "alkylated DNA repair protein AlkB"}, "panther" {"PTHR16557" "ALKYLATED DNA REPAIR PROTEIN ALKB-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Alkylated DNA repair protein AlkB", "short" "Alkb"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 46, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4274, "taxa" 15714, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12931, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12931, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9297}, "pathways" 34}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
