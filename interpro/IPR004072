{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a vast protein family that encompasses a wide range of functions, including various autocrine, paracrine and endocrine processes. They show considerable diversity at the sequence level, on the basis of which they can be separated into distinct groups [[cite:PUB00053635]]. The term clan can be used to describe the GPCRs, as they embrace a group of families for which there are indications of evolutionary relationship, but between which there is no statistically significant similarity in sequence [[cite:PUB00004961]]. The currently known clan members include rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Class A, GPCRA), secretin-like GPCRs (Class B, GPCRB), metabotropic glutamate receptor family (Class C, GPCRC), fungal mating pheromone receptors (Class D, GPCRD), cAMP receptors (Class E, GPCRE) and frizzled/smoothened (Class F, GPCRF) [[cite:PUB00004961], [cite:PUB00063577], [cite:PUB00063578], [cite:PUB00063579], [cite:PUB00063580]].  GPCRs are major drug targets, and are consequently the subject of considerable research interest. It has been reported that the repertoire of GPCRs for endogenous ligands consists of approximately 400 receptors in humans and mice [[cite:PUB00053635]]. Most GPCRs are identified on the basis of their DNA sequences, rather than the ligand they bind, those that are unmatched to known natural ligands are designated by as orphan GPCRs, or unclassified GPCRs [[cite:PUB00063816]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The rhodopsin-like GPCRs (GPCRA) represent a widespread protein family that includes hormone, neurotransmitter and light receptors, all of which transduce extracellular signals through interaction with guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Although their activating ligands vary widely in structure and character, the amino acid sequences of the receptors are very similar and are believed to adopt a common structural framework comprising 7 transmembrane (TM) helices [[cite:PUB00000131], [cite:PUB00002477], [cite:PUB00004960]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Pheromones have evolved in all animal phyla, to signal sex and dominance status, and are responsible for stereotypical social and sexual behaviour among members of the same species. In mammals, these chemical signals are believed to be detected primarily by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a chemosensory organ located at the base of the nasal septum [[cite:PUB00007338]]. The VNO is present in most amphibia, reptiles and non-primate mammals but is absent in birds, adult catarrhine monkeys and apes [[cite:PUB00007339]]. An active role for the human VNO in the detection of pheromones is disputed; the VNO is clearly present in the foetus but appears to be atrophied or absent in adults. Three distinct families of putative pheromone receptors have been identified in the vomeronasal organ (V1Rs, V2Rs and V3Rs). All are G protein-coupled receptors but are only distantly related to the receptors of the main olfactory system, highlighting their different role [[cite:PUB00007338]].</p>\n\n<p>The V1 receptors share between 50 and 90% sequence identity but have little similarity to other families of G protein-coupled receptors. They appear to be distantly related to the mammalian T2R bitter taste receptors and the rhodopsin-like GPCRs [[cite:PUB00007340]]. In rat, the family comprises 30-40 genes. These are expressed in the apical regions of the VNO, in neurons expressing Gi2. Coupling of the receptors to this protein mediates inositol trisphosphate signalling [[cite:PUB00007338]]. A number of human V1 receptor homologues have also been found. The majority of these human sequences are pseudogenes [[cite:PUB00007341]] but an apparently functional receptor has been identified that is expressed in the human olfactory system [[cite:PUB00007342]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24062" "VOMERONASAL TYPE-1 RECEPTOR"}, "pfam" {"PF03402" "Vomeronasal organ pheromone receptor family, V1R"}, "prints" {"PR01534" "VOMERONASL1R"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vomeronasal receptor, type 1", "short" "Vmron_rcpt_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 44, "proteomes" 274, "taxa" 1430, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7943, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7743, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5172}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004072", :literature {"PUB00007340" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Josefsson LG."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(99)00392-3", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Evidence for kinship between diverse G-protein coupled receptors.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "333-40", "volume" "239", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10548735}, "PUB00007338" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Pantages E" "Dulac C."], "ISO_journal" "Neuron", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00157-4", "medline_journal" "Neuron", "title" "A novel family of candidate pheromone receptors in mammals.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "835-45", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11163270}, "PUB00002477" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Casey PJ" "Gilman AG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
