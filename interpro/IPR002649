{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In transfer RNA many different modified nucleosides are found, especially in the anticodon region. tRNA (guanine (N1))-methyltransferase TrmD [ec:2.1.1.228] is one of several nucleases operating together with the tRNA-modifying enzymes before the formation of the mature tRNA. It catalyses the reaction:\n<reaction>\nS-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine37 in tRNA ->S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing N1-methylguanine \n</reaction>\n</p>\n\n<p>It methylates guanosine(G) to N1-methylguanine (1-methylguanosine (m1G)) at position 37 of tRNAs that read CUN (leucine), CCN(proline), and CGG (arginine) codons.  The presence of m1G improves the cellular growth rate and the polypeptide steptime and also prevents the tRNA from shifting the reading frame [[cite:PUB00006251]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7kff", "name" "Crystal structure of TrmD tRNA (guanine-N1)-methyltransferase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae in complex with SAH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029026", "name" "tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR029028", "name" "Alpha/beta knot methyltransferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023148", "name" "tRNA (guanine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd18080" "tRNA-M1G37-methyltransferase TrmD"}, "panther" {"PTHR46417" "TRNA (GUANINE-N(1)-)-METHYLTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00605" "tRNA (guanine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase [trmD]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000386" "tRNA-(m1G37) methyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00088" "tRNA (guanosine(37)-N1)-methyltransferase TrmD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase TrmD", "short" "tRNA_m1G_MeTrfase_TrmD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 140, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9172, "taxa" 36671, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43332, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43324, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33217}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
