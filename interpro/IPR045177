{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a biological process in which non-coding RNA molecules direct the addition of DNA methylation to specific DNA sequences. This entry represents a sub-group of SGS3-LIKE plant proteins that are components of RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (RdDM), including FDM1-5 and IDN2 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00098201], [cite:PUB00072951]]. RdDM has been implicated in a number of regulatory processes in plants, such as maintaining transposable element silencing and genome stability, affecting gamete formation and seed viability and protecting the plant from other biotic stresses [[cite:PUB00098202]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21596" "RIBONUCLEASE P SUBUNIT P38"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Factor of DNA methylation 1-5/IDN2", "short" "FDM1-5/IDN2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 249, "taxa" 991, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4454, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4454, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2643}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045177", :literature {"PUB00098201" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Xie M" "Ren G" "Zhang C" "Yu B."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The DNA- and RNA-binding protein FACTOR of DNA METHYLATION 1 requires XH domain-mediated complex formation for its function in RNA-directed DNA methylation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "491-500", "volume" "72", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22757778}, "PUB00072951" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Ausin I" "Greenberg MV" "Simanshu DK" "Hale CJ" "Vashisht AA" "Simon SA" "Lee TF" "Feng S" "Espanola SD" "Meyers BC" "Wohlschlegel JA" "Patel DJ" "Jacobsen SE."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
