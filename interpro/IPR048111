{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This small entry represents Ferredoxin 2Fe-2s from Azotobacter vinelandii (also known as 2FeAvFdI) and similar proteins [[cite:PUB00115854]].

The occurrence of 2FeAvFdI-encoding gene in the nif gene cluster, and the interaction between the 2FeCpFd and the nitrogenase MoFe protein, suggest that both proteins might be involved in nitrogen fixation, with possibly similar roles.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041613" "2Fe-2S ferredoxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferredoxin 2Fe-2S, Azotobacter-type", "short" "Fdxn_Azotob-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23, "sets" 0, "proteins" 23, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048111", :literature {"PUB00115854" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Chatelet C" "Meyer J."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Inorg Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Inorg Chem", "title" "The [2Fe-2S] protein I (Shetna protein I) from Azotobacter vinelandii is homologous to the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "311-7", "volume" "4", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10439076}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048111", "name" "Ferredoxin 2Fe-2S, Azotobacter-type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
