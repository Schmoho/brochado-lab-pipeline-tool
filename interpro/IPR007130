{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes diacylglycerol acyltransferases which catalyse the terminal and only committed step in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis using diacylglycerol (DAG) and fatty acyl-CoA as substrates. It is required for synthesis and storage of intracellular triglycerides [[cite:PUB00099608], [cite:PUB00055421], [cite:PUB00099607], [cite:PUB00009790], [cite:PUB00010588]]. In yeast, it is involved in lipid particle synthesis from the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting localized TAG production at discrete ER subdomains, and in ergosterol biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00099608], [cite:PUB00055421]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 1 and 2 (AWAT1/2), which catalyse the formation of ester bonds between fatty alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs to form wax monoesters [[cite:PUB00099610], [cite:PUB00099609]]. AWAT2 (also known as MFAT) also possesses acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) activity that catalyses 11-cis-specific retinyl ester synthesis and shows higher catalytic efficiency toward 11-cis-retinol versus 9-cis-retinol, 13-cis-retinol, and all-trans-retinol substrates [[cite:PUB00099611]].</p>\n\n<p>Phytyl ester synthase 1/2, chloroplastic, an acyltransferase involved in fatty acid phytyl ester synthesis in chloroplasts, also belongs to this family. This process is required for the maintenance of the photosynthetic membrane integrity during abiotic stress and senescence [[cite:PUB00100302]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03982" "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase", "short" "DAGAT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 232, "proteomes" 2733, "taxa" 9897, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15687, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14724, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9765}, "pathways" 257}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
