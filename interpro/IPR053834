{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is involved in post-translational modification of substrate proteins through a process known as sampylation [[cite:PUB00058155], [cite:PUB00138937]]. Members of this family function by covalently attaching to lysine residues on target proteins via an isopeptide bond formed with the C-terminal glycine carboxylate of the modifier protein. Additionally, these proteins act as sulfur carriers during the thiolation of tRNA. They are capable of forming polymeric chains through a specific lysine residue, which is a characteristic reminiscent of ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like modifiers. This modification can serve as a signal for proteolytic degradation, targeting proteins to the proteasome.</p>", "llm" true, "checked" true, "updated" true}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR053752", "name" "Small archaeal modifier domain-containing protein", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016155", "name" "Molybdopterin synthase/thiamin biosynthesis sulphur carrier, beta-grasp", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041919" "ubiquitin-like small modifier protein SAMP2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin-like small modifier protein 2, halobacteria", "short" "SAMP2_halobacteria"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 119, "taxa" 568, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 404, "sets" 0, "proteins" 404, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 354}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR053834", :literature {"PUB00058155" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7277", "authors" ["Humbard MA" "Miranda HV" "Lim JM" "Krause DJ" "Pritz JR" "Zhou G" "Chen S" "Wells L" "Maupin-Furlow JA."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08659", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifier proteins (SAMPs) in Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "54-60", "volume" "463", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20054389}, "PUB00138937" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Li Y" "Maciejewski MW" "Martin J" "Jin K" "Zhang Y" "Maupin-Furlow JA" "Hao B."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Crystal structure of the ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifier protein 2 from Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1206-17", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23821306}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR053833", "name" "Small archaeal modifier protein 2", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR053834", "name" "Ubiquitin-like small modifier protein 2, halobacteria", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
