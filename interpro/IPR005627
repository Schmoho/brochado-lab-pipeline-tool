{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>CutC was originally thought to be involved in copper tolerance in Escherichia coli, as mutation in the corresponding gene lead to an increased copper sensitivity [[cite:PUB00009886]]. However, this phenotype has been later reported to depend on the levels of the mRNA-interfering complementary RNA regulator MicL, which is transcribed from a promoter located within the coding sequence of the cutC gene in the enterobacteria [[cite:PUB00099855]]. In the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, this protein has been reported as specific for copper efflux [[cite:PUB00099857]]. The structure of this protein in the bacteria Shigella flexneri showed a monomer structure that adopts a common TIM β/α barrel with 8 β-strands surrounded by 8 α-helices [[cite:PUB00038243]].</p>\n\n<p>The human homologue of this protein, which structure showed a potential copper-binding site, has an important role in intracellular copper homeostasis [[cite:PUB00099854], [cite:PUB00099856]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1x7i", "name" "Crystal structure of the native copper homeostasis protein (cutCm) with calcium binding from Shigella flexneri 2a str. 301"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036822", "name" "CutC-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00795" "PF03932 family protein CutC [cutC]"}, "pfam" {"PF03932" "CutC family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12598" "COPPER HOMEOSTASIS PROTEIN CUTC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CutC-like", "short" "CutC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 80, "proteomes" 4873, "taxa" 18529, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17073, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12561}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005627", :literature {"PUB00009886" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Gupta SD" "Lee BT" "Camakaris J" "Wu HC."], "ISO_journal" "J.
