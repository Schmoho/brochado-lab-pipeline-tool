{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are required for type I protein secretion and have an N-terminal ABC transporter type 1 transmembrane domain and a C-terminal P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain.  The transmembrane domain forms a pore in the inner membrane and the ATP-binding domain is responsible for energy generation.  Sequences are mainly from bacteria, but there are homologues from eukaryotes and archaea.  Proteins in this entry include the following:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Lipid A export ATP-binding/permease protein MsbA, which is required for lipid A and possibly glycerophospholipid transport, and for biogenesis of the outer membrane in bacteria [[cite:PUB00053164]]</li>\n<li>Beta-(1-->2)glucan export ATP-binding/permease protein NdvA from nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which is required for beta-(1-->2)glucan export, essential for nodule formation in legume roots [[cite:PUB00060286]]</li>\n<li>Iron-sulfur clusters transporter ATM1, a yeast mitochondrial protein that exports Fe/S cluster-containing protein precursors and other mitochondrially synthesized proteins to the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00089675]].  The mammalian equivalents are the ATP-binding cassette sub-family B members 6, 7, 8 and 9, which are required for the transport of heme and porphyrin from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion [[cite:PUB00072084]]</li>\n<li>Leukotoxin translocation ATP-binding protein LktB, required for leukotoxin export in<i>Mannheimia haemolytica</i></li>\n<li>Multidrug resistance protein 1, which exports xenobiotics, such as cytotoxic drugs, out of cells leading to tumour cell resistance to multiple drugs [[cite:PUB00089676]].  The bacterial equivalents include multidrug resistance-like ATP-binding protein MdlA</li>\n<li>Alpha-hemolysin translocation ATP-binding protein HlyB from<i>E. coli</i>, a component of the ABC transporter complex HlyBD required for the export of hemolysin [[cite:PUB00089677]]</li>\n<li>Phosphatidylcholine translocator ABCB4, required for lipid secretion in the bile, transporting phosphatidylcholine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane bilayer into the canaliculi of hepatocytes [[cite:PUB00089678]]</li>\n<li>Bile salt export pump, required for the secretion of bile salts into the canaliculus of hepatocytes [[cite:PUB00089679]]</li>\n<li>Antigen peptide transporter 1, which is required for the transport of antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum for association with MHC class I molecules [[cite:PUB00089680]]</li>\n<li>P-glycoprotein 14 which exports polar lipids into the developing pharyngeal cuticle to protect against xenobiotic insult [[cite:PUB00154511]]. PGP-14 has an internal duplication and two copies of the constituent domains.</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2pmk", "name" "Crystal structures of an isolated ABC-ATPase in complex with TNP-ADP"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036640", "name" "ABC transporter type 1, transmembrane domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR24222" "ABC TRANSPORTER B FAMILY", "PTHR24221" "ATP-BINDING CASSETTE SUB-FAMILY B", "PTHR43394" "ATP-DEPENDENT PERMEASE MDL1, MITOCHONDRIAL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type 1 protein exporter", "short" "Type_1_exporter"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 308, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 12180, "taxa" 47999, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 451638, "sets" 0, "proteins" 451638, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 323277}, "pathways" 62}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
