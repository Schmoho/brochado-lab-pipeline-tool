{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>HarA (also known as isdH) is a haem-binding NEAT-domain (NEAr Transporter, [interpro:IPR006635]) protein which has been shown to bind to the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex in order to extract haem from it. HarA has also been reported to bind haemoglobin directly [[cite:PUB00043982]]. HarA (also known as IsdH) contains three NEAT domains as well as a sortase A C-terminal signal for localisation to the cell wall. The haem bound at the third of these NEAT domains has been shown to be transferred to the IsdA protein also localised at the cell wall, presumably through an additional specific protein-protein interaction [[cite:PUB00045368]]. Haptoglobin is a haemoglobin carrier protein involved in scavenging haemoglobin in the blood following red blood cell lysis and targetting it to the liver.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03658" "haptoglobin-binding heme uptake protein HarA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Iron-regulated surface determinant protein H", "short" "IsdH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 23, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 35, "sets" 0, "proteins" 35, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0828", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0828"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019930", :literature {"PUB00043982" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Pilpa RM" "Fadeev EA" "Villareal VA" "Wong ML" "Phillips M" "Clubb RT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
