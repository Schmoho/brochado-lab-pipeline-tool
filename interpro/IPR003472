{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The four families of large eukaryotic DNA viruses, Poxviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, and Phycodnaviridae, referred to collectively as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses or NCLDV, have all been shown to have a lipid membrane, in spite of the major differences in virion structure. The paralogous genes L1R and F9L encode membrane proteins that have a conserved domain architecture, with a single, C-terminal transmembrane helix, and an N-terminal, multiple-disulphide-bonded domain. The conservation of the myristoylated, disulphide-bonded protein Entry-fusion complex associated protein OPG095 (L1R)/EFC-associated protein OPG053 (F9L) in most of the NCLDV correlates with the conservation of the thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase E10R which, in vaccinia virus, is required for the formation of disulphide bonds in L1R and F9L [[cite:PUB00033628]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes Inner membrane protein pE248R from African swine fever virus. This protein is essential for viral fusion with host endosomal membrane and core release [[cite:PUB00100256]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ypy", "name" "Crystal Structure of Vaccinia Virus L1 protein"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02442" "Lipid membrane protein of large eukaryotic DNA viruses"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Virion membrane protein, poxvirus L1-related", "short" "Virion_mem_poxvirus_L1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 321, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 453, "sets" 0, "proteins" 453, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003472", :literature {"PUB00033628" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Aravind L" "Koonin EV."], "ISO_journal" "J.
