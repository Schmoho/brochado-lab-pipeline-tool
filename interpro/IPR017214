{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of DOMON domain (named after DOpamine beta-MOnooxygenase N-terminal domain) containing proteins from plants. They also contain a cytochrome b561 domain C-terminal to the DOMON domain. DOMON domain could bind catecholamines and thereby could regulate the cytochrome b561 domain function. Proteins in this family may act as a catecholamine-responsive trans-membrane electron transporter [[cite:PUB00072923]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037471" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP037471 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b561 and DOMON domain-containing protein", "short" "UCP037471"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 948, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3324, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1851}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017214", :literature {"PUB00072923" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Verelst W" "Asard H."], "ISO_journal" "J.
