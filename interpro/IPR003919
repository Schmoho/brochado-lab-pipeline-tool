{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>An operon encoding 4 proteins required for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis (bcs) in Acetobacter xylinus (Gluconacetobacter xylinus) has been isolated via genetic complementation with strains lacking cellulose synthase activity [[cite:PUB00007624]]. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed the cellulose synthase operon to consist of 4 genes, designated bcsA, bcsB, bcsC and bcsD, all of which are required for maximal bacterial cellulose synthesis in A. xylinum.</p>\n\n<p>The calculated molecular mass of the protein encoded by bcsA is 84.4kDa [[cite:PUB00007624]]. Sequence analysis suggests that the gene product is an integral membrane protein with several transmembrane (TM) domains [[cite:PUB00007625]]. It is postulated that the protein is anchored in the membrane at the N-terminal end by a single hydrophobic helix. Two potential N-glycosylation sites are predicted from sequence analysis, consistent with earlier observations that BcsA is a glycoprotein. The function of BcsA is unknown. The sequence shares a high degree of similarity with Escherichia coli YhjO.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Cellulose synthase catalyzes the beta-1,4 polymerisation of glucose residues in the formation of cellulose.

The regulatory domain binds the allosteric activator cyclic di-GMP [[cite:PUB00055000], [cite:PUB00049330]].
