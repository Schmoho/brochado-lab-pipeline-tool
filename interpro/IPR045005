{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of BTB/POZ and MATH domain-containing proteins mostly from plants, including BPM1-6 from Arabidopsis. They are part of the Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and are known to bind at least three families of transcription factors: ERF/AP2 class I, homeobox-leucine zipper and R2R3 MYB.
