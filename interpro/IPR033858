{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes lid subunits of the 26 S proteasome regulatory particles, Rpn7 (PSMD7; proteasome 26S non-ATPase subunit 7; p44), and Rpn8 (PSMD8; proteasome 26S non-ATPase subunit 8; p40; Mov34). Rpn7 is known to be critical for the integrity of the 26 S proteasome complex by establishing a correct lid structure [[cite:PUB00045323]]. It is necessary for the incorporation/anchoring of Rpn3 and Rpn12 to the lid and essential for viability and normal mitosis. Rpn7 and Rpn8 are ATP-independent components of the 19S regulator subunit, and contain the MPN structural motif on its N-terminal region. However, while they show a typical MPN metalloprotease fold and are members of peptidase family M67, they lack the canonical JAMM motif, and therefore do not show catalytic isopeptidase activity [[cite:PUB00043222]]. Rpn7 is considered a non-peptidase homologue (MEROPS identifier M67.973).  It is suggested that Rpn7 function is primarily structural [[cite:PUB00045068], [cite:PUB00081447]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5w83", "name" "Rpn8/Rpn11 dimer complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08062" "Mpr1p, Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domains without catalytic isopeptidase activity, found in 19S proteasomal subunits Rpn7 and Rpn8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "26S Proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 7/8", "short" "MPN_RPN7_8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 96, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2483, "taxa" 10248, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4761, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4760, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2643}, "pathways" 266}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2012", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2012"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR033858", :literature {"PUB00043222" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sanches M" "Alves BS" "Zanchin NI" "Guimaraes BG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
