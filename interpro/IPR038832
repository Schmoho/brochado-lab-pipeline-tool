{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes cell division cycle-associated protein 3 (CDCA3; also known as trigger of mitotic entry protein 1 or TOME-1), which is required for entry into mitosis.  The protein is found at high levels during the G2 and M phases of mitosis, but declines rapidly during the G2 phase.  Entry into mitosis requires the relocalization to the nucleus and activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) by association with cyclin B, and exit from mitosis occurs when cyclin B is degraded and the kinase activity decreases.  Anaphase promoting complex (APC) is an E3 ligase active during anaphase and G1, and is required for the degradation of cyclin B.  CDCA3 is a cytosolic protein and a substrate of APC.  It associates with Skp-1 and is required for the degradation of the cdk1 inhibitor wee1, a tyrosine kinase.  Degradation of CDCA3 leads to an accumulation of wee1 during interphase [[cite:PUB00088468]].  The CDCA3 protein contains an F-box-like region and a KEN box; the latter is required for association with the APC complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34756" "CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cell division cycle-associated protein 3", "short" "CDCA3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 600, "taxa" 2556, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1052, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1052, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 694}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038832", :literature {"PUB00088468" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ayad NG" "Rankin S" "Murakami M" "Jebanathirajah J" "Gygi S" "Kirschner MW."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00232-0", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Tome-1, a trigger of mitotic entry, is degraded during G1 via the APC.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "101-13", "volume" "113", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12679038}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR038832", "name" "Cell division cycle-associated protein 3", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
