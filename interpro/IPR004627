{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase is a tetrameric, zinc-binding, NAD-dependent enzyme involved in threonine catabolism. It catalyses the conversion of L-threonine and NAD(+) to L-2-amino-3-oxobutanoate and NADH. In Escherichia coli His-90 modulates substrate specificity and is believed to be part of the active site. Closely related proteins include sorbitol dehydrogenase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase.
