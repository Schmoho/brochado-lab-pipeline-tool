{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The bacterial Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is capable of injecting toxins into eukaryotic cells, which contributes to a successful infection [[cite:PUB00075434]]. This entry represents a group of Gram-negative bacterial proteins that form part of the type VI pathogenicity secretion system (T6SS), including TssG [[cite:PUB00077772]]. TssG is homologues to phage tail proteins and is required for proper assembly of the Hcp tube (the T6SS inner tube) in bacteria.
