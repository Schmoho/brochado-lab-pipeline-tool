{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents DNA-binding proteins that preferentially recognise a curved DNA sequence. It is probably a functional analog of DnaJ; displaying overlapping activities with DnaJ, but functions under different conditions, probably acting as a molecular chaperone in an adaptive response to environmental stresses other than heatshock. these proteins lack autonomous chaperone activity and bind native substrates and targets them for recognition by DnaK. Their activity is inhibited by the binding of CbpM [[cite:PUB00054977], [cite:PUB00055024]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01154" "Curved DNA-binding protein [cbpA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA-binding protein, curved-DNA", "short" "DNA-bd_curved-DNA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 48, "taxa" 669, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 843, "sets" 0, "proteins" 843, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 660}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023859", :literature {"PUB00055024" {"URL" nil, "issue" "19", "authors" ["Wegrzyn A" "Taylor K" "Wegrzyn G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
