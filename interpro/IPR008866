{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of several phage terminase large subunit proteins, including GpA (also known as TerL) from Bacteriophage lambda and from Enterobacteria phage P21, as well as related sequences from several bacterial species. The DNA packaging enzyme of Bacteriophage lambda, terminase, is a heteromultimer composed of a small subunit, gpNu1 involved in DNA recognition, and a large subunit, gpA involved in late stages of packaging, products of the Nu1 and A genes, respectively. Terminase is involved in the site-specific binding and cutting of the DNA in the initial stages of packaging. This large subunit is an ATPase required for viral DNA translocation into empty capsids and also acts as an endonuclease that cuts the viral genome from the concetamer to initiate and to end the packaging reaction [[cite:PUB00011497], [cite:PUB00095690], [cite:PUB00095691]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_04144" "Terminase, large subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage lambda, GpA-like", "short" "Phage_lambda_GpA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 756, "taxa" 4602, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4622, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4622, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3054}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
