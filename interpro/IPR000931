{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Adenoviruses are responsible for diseases such as pneumonia, cystitis, conjunctivitis and diarrhoea, all of which can be fatal to patients who are immunocompromised [[cite:PUB00005244]]. Viral infection commences with recognition of host cell receptors by means of specialised proteins on viral surfaces. The adenovirus fibre protein `knob domain' at the C terminus is one such receptor-binding protein subunit. The crystal structure of the knob domain reveals a trimeric organisation, each subdomain folded into 2 functionally distinct Î²-sheets. The V sheet is highly conserved, and provides contact surfaces in the formation of the trimer, while the R sheet is more variable, and may play a role in viral-receptor interactions. The overall shape of the trimer resembles a 3-bladed propeller, with a central surface depression and 3 valleys formed by the symmetry-related R sheets. Sequence comparison of different types of adenovirus fibre protein suggests an overall similarity in the structure of the knob domain. The main conserved regions lie in the central surface depression around the 3-fold symmetry axis [[cite:PUB00005244]]. The N terminus of the protein contains the 'shaft' region.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008982", "name" "Adenovirus pIV-like, attachment domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009013", "name" "Attachment protein shaft domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00307" "ADENOVSFIBRE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenovirus fibre protein", "short" "Adeno_fibre"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 75, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 58, "taxa" 370, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8659, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1537, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000931", :literature {"PUB00005244" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Xia D" "Henry LJ" "Gerard RD" "Deisenhofer J."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(94)00126-X", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain of adenovirus type 5 fiber protein at 1.7 A resolution.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "1259-70", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7704534}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0007155", "name" "cell adhesion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019058", "name" "viral life cycle", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0019062", "name" "virion attachment to host cell", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000931", "name" "Adenovirus fibre protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
