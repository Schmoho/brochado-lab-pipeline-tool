{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Some prokaryotes, such as the purple and green sulphur bacteria, gain energy from a mode of photosynthesis that does not generate oxygen, and is inhibited by its presence [[cite:PUB00034690], [cite:PUB00034691]]. These organisms do not include chlorophylls in their photosynthetic pigments, but instead use closely related molecules known as bacteriochlorophylls. Like chlorophylls, bacteriochlorophylls are tetrapyroles with a five-membered ring structure, differing in the side chains and hydration state of the ring structure. These alterations in structure determine what light wavelengths can be harvested by the organism [[cite:PUB00034692]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bacteriochlorophyll a is a photosynthetic pigment found in many of the purple bacteria. It is synthesised from protoporphyrin IX in a series of reactions including magnesium-chelation, methyl transfer, ring formation, vinyl-group reduction protochlorophyllide reduction, and finally phytol addition [[cite:PUB00034692]]. This entry represents 2-desacetyl-2-hydroxyethyl bacteriochlorophyllide a dehydrogenase, the enzyme catalysing the penultimate step in light-independent bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00003756]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01202" "chlorophyll synthesis pathway protein BchC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-desacetyl-2-hydroxyethyl bacteriochlorophyllide a dehydrogenase", "short" "BchC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 388, "taxa" 1395, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1037, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1037, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 786}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0146", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0146"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005903", :literature {"PUB00034690" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Blankenship RE."], "ISO_journal" "Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00872216", "medline_journal" "Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek", "title" "Protein structure, electron transfer and evolution of prokaryotic photosynthetic reaction centers.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "311-29", "volume" "65", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7832589}, "PUB00034691" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yurkov VV" "Beatty JT."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiol.
