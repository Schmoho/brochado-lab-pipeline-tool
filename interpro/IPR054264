{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of archaeal proteins, previously known as DUF6995, representing homologues of PolB1 binding protein 2 (PBP2). PBP2, is a subunit of PolB1 enzyme that is a member of the archaeal B-family of DNA polymerases. PBP2 along with PBP1, associate with distinct surfaces of the larger catalytic subunit and influence the enzymatic properties of the DNA polymerase [[cite:PUB00154412]]. Members of this family adopt a winged helix (HTH) fold ([pdbe:5N35]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5n41", "name" "Archaeal DNA polymerase holoenzyme - SSO6202 at 1.35 Ang resolution"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF22511" "PolB1 Binding Protein 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PolB1 binding protein 2", "short" "PBP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 214, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 225, "sets" 0, "proteins" 225, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 211}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR054264", :literature {"PUB00154412" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Yan J" "Beattie TR" "Rojas AL" "Schermerhorn K" "Gristwood T" "Trinidad JC" "Albers SV" "Roversi P" "Gardner AF" "Abrescia NGA" "Bell SD."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15075", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Identification and characterization of a heterotrimeric archaeal DNA polymerase holoenzyme.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "15075", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28462924}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR054264", "name" "PolB1 binding protein 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 31}}}
