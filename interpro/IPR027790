{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several archaebacterial S-adenosylmethionine synthetase C (AdoMet synthetase or MAT) ([ec:2.5.1.6]). S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) occupies a central role in the metabolism of all cells. The biological roles of AdoMet include acting as the primary methyl group donor, as a precursor to the polyamines, and as a progenitor of a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase catalyses the only known route of AdoMet biosynthesis. The synthetic process occurs in a unique reaction in which the complete triphosphate chain is displaced from ATP and a sulfonium ion formed. MATs from various organisms contain ~400-amino acid polypeptide chains [[cite:PUB00019110]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6s81", "name" "Crystal structure of methionine adenosyltransferase from Pyrococcus furiosus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042544", "name" "S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, domain 3", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042543", "name" "S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, domain 2", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36697" "S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE SYNTHASE"}, "pfam" {"PF01941" "S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (AdoMet synthetase)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosylmethionine synthase", "short" "AdoMet_synthase_2_family"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 437, "taxa" 3120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3299, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3272, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2773}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0789", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0789"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
