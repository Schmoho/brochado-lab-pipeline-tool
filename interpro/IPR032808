{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a family of integral membrane proteins known as DoxX, mostly from bacteria, archaea and animals. In M. tuberculosis, DoxX forms a membrane-associated oxidoreductase complex (MRC) together with the superoxide-detoxifying enzyme (SodA) and a predicted thiol-oxidoreductase (SseA) [[cite:PUB00101424]]. This complex physically links radical detoxification with cytosolic thiol homeostasis. All members of the MRC are required for the correct function as its impairments are correlated with defective recycling of mycothiol and accumulation of cellular oxidative damage [[cite:PUB00101424]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry includes TMEM35A/B from animals. TMEM35A, also known as NACHO, acts as a acetylcholine receptor chaperone that mediates the proper assembly and functional expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) throughout the brain [[cite:PUB00097836]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13564" "DoxX-like family", "PF07681" "DoxX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DoxX family", "short" "DoxX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 127, "proteomes" 7432, "taxa" 29153, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 92594, "sets" 0, "proteins" 92561, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 72127}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032808", :literature {"PUB00101424" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Nambi S" "Long JE" "Mishra BB" "Baker R" "Murphy KC" "Olive AJ" "Nguyen HP" "Shaffer SA" "Sassetti CM."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Host Microbe", "title" "The Oxidative Stress Network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Reveals Coordination between Radical Detoxification Systems.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "829-37", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26067605}, "PUB00097836" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Matta JA" "Gu S" "Davini WB" "Lord B" "Siuda ER" "Harrington AW" "Bredt DS."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "NACHO Mediates Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Function throughout the Brain.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "688-696", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28445721}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR032808", "name" "DoxX family", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016944", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP030066", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR040399", "name" "Transmembrane protein 35A/B", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 57, "alignment:full" 6673}}}
