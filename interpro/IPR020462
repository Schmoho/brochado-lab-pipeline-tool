{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system. They modulate inflammation and immunity by regulating growth, mobility and differentiation of lymphoid and other cells.</p>\n\n<p>Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis, resulting in increased production of platelets, as well as activating osteoclasts, inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and inhibiting macrophage mediator production. These functions may be particularly important in mediating the hematopoietic, osseous and mucosal protective effects of IL-11 [[cite:PUB00013131]]. The cytokine also possesses anti-inflammatory activity, and has been proposed as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis [[cite:PUB00046036]].</p>\n\n<p>Although IL-11 was initially believed to be restricted to mammals, subsequent studies demonstrated it to be expressed in ray-finned fish [[cite:PUB00046037], [cite:PUB00046038]]. Two fish paralogues have now been identified, designated IL-11A and IL-11B [[cite:PUB00046038]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01946" "Interleukin-11B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interleukin-11B, fish", "short" "IL-11B_fish"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 167, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 52, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020462", :literature {"PUB00013131" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8-9", "authors" ["Leng SX" "Elias JA."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
