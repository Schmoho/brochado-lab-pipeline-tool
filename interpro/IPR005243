{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of related prokaryotic sequences, including Thioredoxin from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus. This protein has been reported to not function as a glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase in the presence of glutathione and glutathione reductase and show low thioredoxin activity in vitro [[cite:PUB00036969]]. ArsE from Shewanella putrefaciens ([swissprot:E6XP51]) is also included in this group. It is a small, thioredoxin-like component of a nitroreductase active in converting the nitro group of two different synthetic aromatic organoarsenical compounds to an amine [[cite:PUB00105794]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36450" "THIOREDOXIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037031" "Predicted redox-active disulfide protein 2"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00412" "MTH895/ArsE family thioredoxin-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin-like, prokaryotic", "short" "THIRX-like_proc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1423, "taxa" 7949, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8182, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8149, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6386}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005243", :literature {"PUB00036969" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Bhattacharyya S" "Habibi-Nazhad B" "Amegbey G" "Slupsky CM" "Yee A" "Arrowsmith C" "Wishart DS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi0115176", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Identification of a novel archaebacterial thioredoxin: determination of function through structure.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "4760-70", "volume" "41", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11939770}, "PUB00105794" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Chen J" "Zhang J" "Rosen BP."], "ISO_journal" "Environ Sci Technol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Environ Sci Technol", "title" "Role of ArsEFG in Roxarsone and Nitarsone Detoxification and Resistance.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "6182-6191", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31059239}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005243", "name" "Thioredoxin-like, prokaryotic", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
