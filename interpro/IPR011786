{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Sulphite reductase (NADPH) ([ec:1.8.1.2]) catalyses a six electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide in prokaryotic organisms and is required for the biosynthesis of L-cysteine from sulfate.

The alpha component, encoded by cysJ, is a flavoprotein containing both FMN and FAD, while the beta component, encoded by cysI, is a siroheme, iron-sulphur protein [[cite:PUB00014496]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6c3m", "name" "Wild type structure of SiRHP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02041" "assimilatory sulfite reductase (NADPH) hemoprotein subunit"}, "hamap" {"MF_01540" "Sulfite reductase [NADPH] hemoprotein beta-component [cysI]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulphite reductase (NADPH) hemoprotein, beta subunit", "short" "CysI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1682, "taxa" 6635, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5620, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5620, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3693}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1283", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1283"} {"accession" "GenProp1301", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1301"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
