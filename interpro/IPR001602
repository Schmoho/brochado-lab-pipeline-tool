{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains small uncharacterised proteins of 14 to 16kDa mainly from bacteria although the signatures also occur in a hypothetical protein from archaea and eukaryotes. Members of this protein family, designated YjbQ in E. coli, have been studied extensively by crystallography. Members from several different species have been shown to have sufficient thiamine phosphate synthase activity ([ec:2.5.1.3)) to complement thiE mutants. However, it is presumed that this is a secondary activity, and the primary function of the YjbQ family enzyme remains unknown [[cite:PUB00101020], [cite:PUB00101019]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2cu5", "name" "Crystal Structure Of The Conserved Hypothetical Protein TT1486 From Thermus Thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035917", "name" "YjbQ-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00149" "secondary thiamine-phosphate synthase enzyme YjbQ"}, "panther" {"PTHR30615" "UNCHARACTERIZED PROTEIN YJBQ-RELATED"}, "prosite" {"PS01314" "Uncharacterized protein family UPF0047 signature"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004681" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP004681 type"}, "pfam" {"PF01894" "Uncharacterised protein family UPF0047"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "UPF0047 protein YjbQ-like", "short" "UPF0047_YjbQ-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 103, "proteomes" 6790, "taxa" 27265, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34066, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33992, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25999}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC01018", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC01018"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001602", :literature {"PUB00101020" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Morett E" "Saab-Rincon G" "Olvera L" "Olvera M" "Flores H" "Grande R."], "ISO_journal" "J Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Mol Biol", "title" "Sensitive genome-wide screen for low secondary enzymatic activities: the YjbQ family shows thiamin phosphate synthase activity.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "839-53", "volume" "376", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18178222}, "PUB00101019" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kim J" "Kershner JP" "Novikov Y" "Shoemaker RK" "Copley SD."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Syst Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Syst Biol", "title" "Three serendipitous pathways in E. coli can bypass a block in pyridoxal-5'-phosphate synthesis.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "436", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21119630}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR001602", "name" "UPF0047 protein YjbQ-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 548, "alignment:full" 7652}}}
