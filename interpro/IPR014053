{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Formylmethanofuran:tetrahyromethanopterin formyltransferase (Ftr) is involved in C1 metabolism in methanogenic archaea, sulphate-reducing archaea and methylotrophic bacteria. It catalyses the following reversible reaction:</p>\n\n<p><reaction>N-formylmethanofuran + 5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin = methanofuran + 5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin</reaction></p>\n\n<p>Ftr from the thermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri (optimum growth temperature 98 degrees C) is a hyperthermophilic enzyme that is absolutely dependent on the presence of lyotropic salts for activity and thermostability. The crystal structure of Ftr reveals a homotetramer composed essentially of two dimers. Each subunit is subdivided into two tightly associated lobes both consisting of a predominantly antiparallel β sheet flanked by α helices forming an α/β sandwich structure. The approximate location of the active site was detected in a region close to the dimer interface [[cite:PUB00005787]]. Ftr from the mesophilic methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri and the sulphate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus have a similar structure [[cite:PUB00016939]].</p>\n\n<p>In the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens, Ftr interacts with three other polypeptides to form an Ftr/cyclohydrolase complex which catalyses the hydrolysis of formyl-tetrahydromethanopterin to formate during growth on C1 substrates [[cite:PUB00016940]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1ftr", "name" "FORMYLMETHANOFURAN:TETRAHYDROMETHANOPTERIN FORMYLTRANSFERASE FROM METHANOPYRUS KANDLERI"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023447", "name" "Formylmethanofuran: tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase Ftr, ferredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00579" "Formylmethanofuran--tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase [ftr]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006414" "Formylmethanofuran:tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03119" "formylmethanofuran--tetrahydromethanopterin N-formyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Formylmethanofuran: tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase Ftr", "short" "ForMFR_H4MPT_ForTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 423, "taxa" 2082, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2704, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2704, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2186}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0671", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0671"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
