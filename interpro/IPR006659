{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a distinct clade, including ArsC itself, of the broader family of ArsC and related proteins. This clade is almost completely restricted to the proteobacteria. An anion-translocating ATPase has been identified as the product of the arsenical resistance operon of resistance plasmid R773 [[cite:PUB00007982]]. When expressed in Escherichia coli this ATP-driven oxyanion pump catalyses extrusion of the oxyanions arsenite, antimonite and arsenate. The pump is composed of two polypeptides, the products of the arsA and arsB genes. The pump alone produces resistance to arsenite and antimonite. This protein, ArsC, catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, and thus extends resistance to include arsenate. ArsC contains a single catalytic cysteine, within a thioredoxin fold, that forms a covalent thiolate-As(V) intermediate, which is reduced by GRX through a mixed GSH-arsenate intermediate [[cite:PUB00025947]]. This family of predominantly bacterial enzymes is unrelated to two other families of arsenate reductases which show similarity to low-molecular-weight acid phosphatases and phosphotyrosyl phosphatases [[cite:PUB00080836], [cite:PUB00080837]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3f0i", "name" "Arsenate reductase from Vibrio cholerae."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03034" "ArsC_ArsC"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00014" "arsenate reductase (glutaredoxin)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenate reductase", "short" "Arsenate_reductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3736, "taxa" 14774, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19215, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19215, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14963}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0474", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0474"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
