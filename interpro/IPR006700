{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methyltransferases (Mtases) are responsible for the transfer of methyl groups between two molecules. The transfer of the methyl group from the ubiquitous S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to either nitrogen, oxygen or carbon atoms is frequently employed in diverse organisms. The reaction is catalysed by Mtases and modifies DNA, RNA, proteins or small molecules, such as catechol, for regulatory purposes. Proteins in this entry belong to the RsmE family of Mtases, this is supported by crystal structural studies, which show a close structural homology to other known methyltransferases [[cite:PUB00029267]].</p>\n\n<p>This group of proteins includes Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase E (RsmE) from Escherichia coli, which specifically methylates the uridine in position 1498 of 16S rRNA in the fully assembled 30S ribosomal subunit [[cite:PUB00044729], [cite:PUB00044730]]. This enzyme has two distinct but structurally related domains: the N-terminal PUA domain and the conserved MTase domain at the C-terminal end. This protein adopts a dimeric configuration that is functionally critical for substrate binding and catalysis [[cite:PUB00062463]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2egv", "name" "Crystal structure of rRNA methyltransferase with SAM ligand"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029026", "name" "tRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR029028", "name" "Alpha/beta knot methyltransferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015601" "Predicted S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent RNA methyltransferase, slr0722 type"}, "panther" {"PTHR30027" "RIBOSOMAL RNA SMALL SUBUNIT METHYLTRANSFERASE E"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00046" "RsmE family RNA methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase E", "short" "RsmE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9190, "taxa" 35126, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43602, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43559, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 33066}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
