{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>L-lysine epsilon-oxidase is responsible for oxidative deamination of L-lysine, producing L-2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde [[cite:PUB00081300]]. Hydrogen peroxide is a side-product of this enzymatic reaction, which requires the cofactor CTQ (cysteine tryptophylquinone) [[cite:PUB00081299]]. CTQ most likely forms a Schiff base with the free amino acid substrate. The protein is also called marinocine, for its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity; the latter is most likely caused by hydrogen peroxide synthesis [[cite:PUB00081301]]. The dimerization interface observed in the available 3D structure does not seem to be conserved. Homologues of LodA have been detected in various Gram-negative bacteria, and they appear to be associated with the formation of biofilms [[cite:PUB00081667]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3weu", "name" "Crystal structure of the L-Lys epsilon-oxidase from Marinomonas mediterranea"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14732" "L-lysine epsilon-oxidase from Marinomonas mediterranea and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-lysine epsilon-oxidase", "short" "LodA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 73, "taxa" 519, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 257, "sets" 0, "proteins" 257, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 197}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
