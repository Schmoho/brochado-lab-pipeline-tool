In some bacteria, the tandem S1 array is located C-terminal to a 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HMBPP reductase) domain. While RPS1 is found primarily in bacteria, proteins with tandem RPS1-like domains have been identified in plants and humans, however these lack the N-terminal HMBPP reductase domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012340", "name" "Nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00681" "RIBOSOMALS1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal protein S1-like", "short" "Ribosomal_protein_S1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 71, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9143, "taxa" 36883, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 364131, "sets" 0, "proteins" 46748, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 35598}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
