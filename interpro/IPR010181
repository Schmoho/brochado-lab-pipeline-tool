{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a putative redox-active protein of about 140 residues, with four perfectly conserved Cys residues. It includes a CGAXXG motif. Most members are found within one or two loci of transporter or oxidoreductase genes. A member from Geobacter sulfurreducens, located in a molybdenum transporter operon, has a TAT (twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane, a hallmark of bound prosthetic groups such as FeS clusters.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09719" "Putative redox-active protein (C_GCAxxG_C_C)"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01909" "C-GCAxxG-C-C family (seleno)protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CGCAxxGCC motif", "short" "CGCAxxGCC_motif"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 53, "proteomes" 1155, "taxa" 5672, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8955, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8814, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6668}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010181", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010181", "name" "CGCAxxGCC motif", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 281, "alignment:full" 1950}}}
