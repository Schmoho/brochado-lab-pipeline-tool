{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The outer membrane-spanning (Oms) proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi have been isolated and their porin activities characterised; 0.6-nS porin activity was found to reside in a 28kDa protein, designated Oms28 [[cite:PUB00002301]]. The gene sequence of oms28 was found to encode a 257-amino-acid precursor protein with a putative 24-amino-acid leader peptidase I signal sequence [[cite:PUB00002301]]. The Oms28 protein partly fractionated to the outer membrane, and was characterised by an average single-channel conductance of 1.1 nS in a planar lipid bilayer assay, confirming Oms28 to be a porin [[cite:PUB00002301]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03532" "OMS28 porin"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF020370" "Outer membrane porin (Oms28)"}, "prints" {"PR01027" "OMS28PORIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Porin, Oms28 type", "short" "Porin_Oms28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 40, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 36, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000839", :literature {"PUB00002301" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Skare JT" "Champion CI" "Mirzabekov TA" "Shang ES" "Blanco DR" "Erdjument-Bromage H" "Tempst P" "Kagan BL" "Miller JN" "Lovett MA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
