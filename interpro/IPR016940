ComGC, GD, GE and GG have N-terminal sequence motifs typical of type 4 pre-pilins and are processed by a pathway that requires the product of comC, also an essential competence gene. They form pilin-like structures that are localised to the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall [[cite:PUB00045993]]. The comG operon also consist of ComGF, a small integral membrane protein, ComGA and ComGB, which are predicted to be a nucleotide binding protein and an integral membrane protein respectively [[cite:PUB00067657]].
