{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are exclusive to the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides). GldN is a protein linked to a type of rapid surface gliding motility found in certain Bacteroidetes, such as Cytophaga johnsonae (Flavobacterium johnsoniae) and Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Knockouts of GldN abolish the gliding phenotype [[cite:PUB00045359]]. Gliding motility appears closely linked to chitin utilization in the model species C. johnsonae. Bacteroidetes with members of this protein also include those which are not believed to express the gliding phenotype, such as Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7pvh", "name" "Crystal structure of the folded domain of PorN"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF19841" "Gliding motility associated protein GldN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03523" "gliding motility protein GldN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gliding motility associated protein GldN", "short" "Gliding_motility_assoc_GldN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 936, "taxa" 3146, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4157, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4114, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3096}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0781", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0781"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019847", :literature {"PUB00045359" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Braun TF" "Khubbar MK" "Saffarini DA" "McBride MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
