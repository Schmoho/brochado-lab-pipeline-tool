They play a role in spermatogenesis, particularly during meiotic division, suggesting a function in the regulation of gene expression during the development of sperm cells.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15577" "ZINC FINGER CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Zinc finger protein 318-like", "short" "Znf318-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 856, "taxa" 3547, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1650, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1650, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 396}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055309", :literature {"PUB00155337" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Tao RH" "Kawate H" "Ohnaka K" "Ishizuka M" "Hagiwara H" "Takayanagi R."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.213", "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "Opposite effects of alternative TZF spliced variants on androgen receptor.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "515-21", "volume" "341", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16446156}, "PUB00155336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ishizuka M" "Kawate H" "Takayanagi R" "Ohshima H" "Tao RH" "Hagiwara H."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.04.024", "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "A zinc finger protein TZF is a novel corepressor of androgen receptor.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "1025-31", "volume" "331", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15882980}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055309", "name" "Zinc finger protein 318-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
