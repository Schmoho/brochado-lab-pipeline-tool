{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>K+Cl- cotransporters (KCCs) belong to the SLC12 family and act as electroneutral symporters of K+ and Cl- ions across the plasma membrane [[cite:PUB00072350], [cite:PUB00072348]]. They are major determinants of osmotic homeostasis. They are involved in the regulatory volume decrease in response to cell swelling in red blood cells, and have been proposed to play a role in the vectorial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup>across kidney epithelia. The transport process involves one for one electroneutral movement of K<sup>+</sup>together with Cl<sup>-</sup>, and, in all known mammalian cells, the net movement is outward [[cite:PUB00002955]].</p>\n\n<p>In neurones, it appears to play a unique role in maintaining low intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup>concentration, which is required for the functioning of Cl<sup>-</sup> dependent fast synaptic inhibition, mediated by certain neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine.</p>\n\n<p>Four isoforms of KCC have been identified: KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, and KCC4. The four KCC isoforms share a common protein structure with a central core of twelve hydrophobic transmembrane domains [[cite:PUB00072352]]. Comparison of their sequences with those of other ion-transporting membrane proteins reveals that they are part of a new superfamily of cation-chloride co-transporters, which includes the Na-Cl and Na-K-2Cl co-transporters. KCC1 is widely expressed in human tissues, while KCC2 is expressed only in brain neurones, making it likely that this is the isoform responsible for maintaining low Cl<sup>-</sup>concentration in neurones [[cite:PUB00002956], [cite:PUB00004291]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01081" "KCLTRNSPORT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "K/Cl co-transporter", "short" "KCL_cotranspt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 855, "taxa" 3458, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39834, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7905, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4500}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000076", :literature {"PUB00072348" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5-6", "authors" ["Lauf PK" "Adragna NC."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
