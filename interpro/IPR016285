{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein found in a variety of paramyxoviruses (negative-stranded RNA viruses), including Mumps virus, Human parainfluenza virus 3, and the avian pathogen Newcastle disease virus. Some paramyxoviruses have two surface glycoproteins, HN and a fusion protein (F). HN is a multi-functional protein with three distinct functions: a receptor-binding (haemagglutinin) activity, a receptor-destroying (neuraminidase) activity, and a membrane fusion activity that fuses the viral envelope to the host cell membrane in order to infect the cell. The fusion activity involves an interaction between HN and the fusion protein. In other viruses, such as influenza A and B viruses, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase occur as separate glycoproteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The haemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein has a six-bladed Î²-propeller structure, and bears structural similarity to influenza A and B virus neuraminidase, bacterial neuraminidase, trypanosomal neuraminidase and transialidase [[cite:PUB00031893], [cite:PUB00031976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7bwu", "name" "Restructuring hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of Newcastle disease virus produced from Oryza sativa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036278", "name" "Sialidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd15469" "Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of parainfluenza virus 5, Newcastle disease virus, and related paramyxoviridiae"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001072" "Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase, paramyxovirus type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haemagglutinin-neuraminidase", "short" "Hemagglutn-neuramid"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 43, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 55, "taxa" 285, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3645, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3622, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
