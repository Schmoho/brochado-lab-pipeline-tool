{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this group are plant response regulators of the B type. B-type plant response regulators most closely resemble the classical microbial response regulators.</p>\n\n<p>Classical two-component signal transduction systems--consisting of a histidine protein kinase (HK) to sense signal input and a response regulator (RR) to mediate output--are widespread in prokaryotes. Their counterparts are also found in eukaryotes, indicating that they represent an ancient and evolutionarily conserved signalling mechanism. In plants, two-component systems are involved in phytohormone, stress, and light signalling [[cite:PUB00027987], [cite:PUB00027950]]. Plant response regulators (called ARRs in Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress)) fall into three distinct families based on domain architecture: A-type RRs are stand-alone receiver domains; B-type RRs contain an N-terminal receiver domain fused to a Myb-like DNA-binding domain and a variable C-terminal domain; pseudo-response regulators contain an atypical receiver domain.</p>\n\n<p>The classical microbial RRs consist of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver (phosphoacceptor) domain and a C-terminal output (usually DNA-binding) domain. In a typical microbial signal transduction system, in response to an environmental stimulus, a phosphoryl group is transferred from the His residue of sensor histidine kinase to an Asp residue in the CheY-like receiver domain of the cognate response regulator [[cite:PUB00011096], [cite:PUB00011190], [cite:PUB00007866]]. Phosphorylation of the receiver domain induces conformational changes that activate an associated output domain, which in turn triggers the response. Phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in response regulator molecules have been demonstrated in direct structural studies [[cite:PUB00011157]].</p>\n\n<p>The output domain of B-type plant RRs is a central Myb-like DNA-binding domain (with the B, or GARP, motif) [[cite:PUB00013193], [cite:PUB00027891], [cite:PUB00027947]] which is not found in two-component prokaryotic systems. This domain is believed to be responsible for the promoter-binding and transcription factor activity of the B-type plant RRs [[cite:PUB00027947], [cite:PUB00027891]]. The B motif contains a helix-turn-helix structure and a potential nuclear localization signal, and is considered to be a multifunctional domain responsible for both nuclear localization and DNA binding [[cite:PUB00013193]].</p>\n\n<p>A variable C-terminal domain may also play a role as part of the output module and provides the basis for defining several small subgroups. The functions of these unique C-terminal domains and biological significance of the subgroups are unclear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036392" "Response regulator, plant B-type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Response regulator B-type, plant", "short" "Response_reg_B-typ_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 961, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2805, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2586, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1575}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017053", :literature {"PUB00027947" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sakai H" "Aoyama T" "Oka A."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00909.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Arabidopsis ARR1 and ARR2 response regulators operate as transcriptional activators.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "703-11", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11135105}, "PUB00011157" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6764", "authors" ["Kern D" "Volkman BF" "Luginbuhl P" "Nohaile MJ" "Kustu S" "Wemmer DE."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/47273", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Structure of a transiently phosphorylated switch in bacterial signal transduction.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "894-8", "volume" "402", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10622255}, "PUB00007866" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["West AH" "Stock AM."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
