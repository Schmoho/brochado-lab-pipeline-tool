Structurally, it consists of 4 Î± helices, 2 long and 2 short.\r\nWithin bacteriophage lambda protein Gam, one of the long helices (H4) acts as a dimerisation interface to form an antiparallel helix. The two short helices (H2 and H3) from each dimer form a 'cross-brace', while the other long helix (H1) protrudes out of the protein [[cite:PUB00042446]].
