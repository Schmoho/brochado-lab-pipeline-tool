{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 25, NatB auxiliary subunit (NAA25) which is the non-catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex (NatB). NAA25 forms a horseshoe-like deck to hold specifically the catalytic subunit Naa20. The NatB complex catalyses the acetylation of the amino-terminal methionine residue of all proteins beginning with Met-Asp or Met-Glu and of some proteins beginning with Met-Asn or Met-Met [[cite:PUB00103804], [cite:PUB00103805]]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) this subunit is called MDM20 and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fission yeast) it is called Arm1. NatB acetylates the Tpm1 protein and regulates and tropomyosin-actin interactions. This subunit is required by the NatB complex for the N-terminal acetylation of Tpm1 [[cite:PUB00044391]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09797" "N-acetyltransferase B complex (NatB) non catalytic subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "N-alpha-acetyltransferase 25, NatB auxiliary subunit", "short" "NAA25_NatB_aux_su"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 89, "proteomes" 2511, "taxa" 8546, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4809, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4646, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2831}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1491", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1491"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019183", :literature {"PUB00103804" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Starheim KK" "Arnesen T" "Gromyko D" "Ryningen A" "Varhaug JE" "Lillehaug JR."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem J", "title" "Identification of the human N(alpha)-acetyltransferase complex B (hNatB): a complex important for cell-cycle progression.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "325-31", "volume" "415", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18570629}, "PUB00103805" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Hong H" "Cai Y" "Zhang S" "Ding H" "Wang H" "Han A."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Molecular Basis of Substrate Specific Acetylation by N-Terminal Acetyltransferase NatB.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "641-649.e3", "volume" "25", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28380339}, "PUB00044391" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Singer JM" "Shaw JM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
