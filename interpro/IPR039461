{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Peptidase family M49 contains exopeptidases that remove dipeptides from the N terminus of peptides and proteins and are known as dipeptidyl-peptidases (DPP).  The best characterized of these is dipeptidyl-peptidase III and represents the prototype for the M49 family of metallopeptidases. It consists of two domains that form a wide cleft containing the catalytic metal ion (DPPIII; [ec:3.4.14.4]; MEROPS identifier M49.001) [[cite:PUB00089699]]. The exopeptidases in M49 are metal-dependent, and bind a single zinc ion via the histidines in an HEXXXH motif, in which the distance between the histidines in one residue longer than in the HEXXH zinc-binding motif found in endopeptidases of clan MA. The importance of the histidines and the glutamic acid was identified by site-directed mutagenesis [[cite:PUB00089698]].  Some members of family M49, notably from bacteria such as<i>Colwelia</i>and plants possess the more usual HEXXH motif [[cite:PUB00090192]].  A third zinc ligand occurs within a motif that has been described as EECRAE [[cite:PUB00089699]].  DPPIII releases N-terminal dipeptides sequentially from peptides such as angiotensins II and III, Leu-enkephalin, prolactin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, but tripeptides are poor substrates and polypeptides of more than ten residues are not cleaved [[cite:PUB00089700], [cite:PUB00089701]].  DPPIII is a soluble, cytosolic enzyme with a housekeeping role, but is elevated in retroplacental serum may participate in the increased angiotensin hydrolysis seen during pregnancy [[cite:PUB00089702]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Nudix hydrolase 3 (NUDT3) from plants, which is thought to hydrolyse nucleoside diphosphate derivatives because of the presence of a Nudix box.  Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), a universal precursor for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds, is hydrolysed; purine nucleotides such as 8-oxo-dATP are dephosphorylated; and the enzyme acts as a dipeptidyl-peptidase against dipeptidyl-2-arylamide substrates [[cite:PUB00090192]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3csk", "name" "Structure of DPP III from Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23422" "DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE III-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF03571" "Peptidase family M49"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase family M49", "short" "Peptidase_M49"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 115, "proteomes" 2796, "taxa" 12168, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11662, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10785, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6708}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
