{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes LIM and senescent cell antigen-like-containing domain protein 1/2 (LIMS1/2, also known as PINCH-1/2) and its homologues LIM domain-containing protein unc-97 and LIM domain-containing protein pin-2 from C.elegans. LIMS1/2 are LIM domain adapter proteins that functions in the integrin and growth factor signal transduction pathway, involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell proliferation and cell differentiation  [[cite:PUB00042822], [cite:PUB00151213], [cite:PUB00028536], [cite:PUB00151215]]. Unc-97 is part of the integrin containing attachment complex, which is required for muscle development and maintenance [[cite:PUB00101472]]; it may also function in adherens junction [[cite:PUB00101471]]. These proteins consist of five LIM domains, which function as adaptors or scaffolds to support the assembly of multimeric protein complexes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038003" "PINCH protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LIM and senescent cell antigen-like-containing domain protein 1/2-like", "short" "PINCH-1/2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 858, "taxa" 3546, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3579, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3516, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2247}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047946", :literature {"PUB00151215" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Braun A" "Bordoy R" "Stanchi F" "Moser M" "Kostka G G" "Ehler E" "Brandau O" "Fassler R."], "ISO_journal" "Exp Cell Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00039-3", "medline_journal" "Exp Cell Res", "title" "PINCH2 is a new five LIM domain protein, homologous to PINCHand localized to focal adhesions.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "239-50", "volume" "284", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12651156}, "PUB00028536" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Velyvis A" "Yang Y" "Wu C" "Qin J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
