The reaction consists of the introduction of a sulphur atom into dethiobiotin, thus requiring activation of C-H bonds [[cite:PUB00002298]]. Biotin (vitamin H) is a prosthetic group in enzymes catalysing carboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions [[cite:PUB00001863]].</p>\n\n<p>Biotin synthase from Escherichia coli is a homodimer of 76kDa, with each polypeptide chain carrying an oxygen-sensitive (4Fe-4S) cluster, probably ligated by three cysteines of a CXXXCXXC box conserved among all known BioB sequences and a fourth still not identified ligand. BioB displays a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulphurase activity, which allows mobilisation of the sulphur atom from free cysteine [[cite:PUB00007197]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8vcw", "name" "X-Ray Crystal Structure of the biotin synthase from B. obeum"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01694" "Biotin synthase [bioB]"}, "panther" {"PTHR22976" "BIOTIN SYNTHASE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00433" "biotin synthase BioB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biotin synthase/Biotin biosynthesis bifunctional protein BioAB", "short" "Biotin_synth/BioAB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7172, "taxa" 28137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27976, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27972, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 21584}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1377", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1377"} {"accession" "GenProp0036", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0036"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
