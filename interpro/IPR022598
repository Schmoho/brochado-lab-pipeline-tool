{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this family have a HotDog fold. This family was formerly known as DUF2662. FcoT from M. tuberculosis (also known as (2E)-enoyl-[ACP] glycyltransferase) is involved in the biosynthesis of a unique class of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLPs) that seem to play a role in metal acquisition in M.marinum [[cite:PUB00151132]]. Its structure [[cite:PUB00048671]] suggested a thioesterase function. Assays showed that this protein was a thioesterase with a preference for long chain fatty acyl groups [[cite:PUB00048671]]. The maximal Kcat was observed for palmitoyl-CoA, although longer and shorter molecules were also cleaved. In solution this protein forms a homo-hexameric complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5wsy", "name" "The complex structure of SAV606 with N-carboxymethyl-3-aminobutyrate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043064", "name" "Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase, Rv0098-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10862" "FcoT-like thioesterase domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase FcoT-like", "short" "FcoT_ThioEstase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 129, "taxa" 700, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 467, "sets" 0, "proteins" 467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 366}, "pathways" 40}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
