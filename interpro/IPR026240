Many such egg antigens, a large portion of which are presumed to originate from the enclosed miracidia, elicit a host-immune response during infections [[cite:PUB00060264]].</p>\n\n<p>Several immunopositive clones have been isolated; three of these were studied in detail and found to contain members of a large, closely related gene family encoding an immunogenic miracidial antigen. At least two members of this family are tightly linked to the Schistosoma japonicum (blood fluke) genome. The fact that there are so many gene copies encoding this antigen, which is reactive with both chronically infected human and mouse sera, make this a potentially important antigen [[cite:PUB00060264]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02101" "Immunogenic miracidial antigen 8I'"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Immunogenic miracidial antigen 8I'", "short" "Miracidia_Ag_8I'"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3, "taxa" 31, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 273, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 267}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026240", :literature {"PUB00060264" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Scallon BJ" "Bogitsh BJ" "Carter CE."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
