{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Maintenance of carboxysome distribution protein A (McdA), a ParA family member [[cite:PUB00151291], [cite:PUB00114557]], and related proteins that are found mainly in proteobacteria. McdA is an ATPase that forms dynamic gradients on the nucleoid in response to adapter protein McdB, which associates with carboxysomes. The interplay between McdA gradients on the nucleoid and McdB-bound carboxysomes result in the equal spacing of Cbs along the cell length [[cite:PUB00153398]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this family contain a variant of the A motif (also known as the 'Walker Box' or P-loop (phosphate binding loop)), that is XXXKGGXXK[TS] where X is any amino acid and amino acids in brackets indicate alternatives.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041546" "ParA family partition ATPase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Maintenance of carboxysome distribution protein A", "short" "McdA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 914, "taxa" 4283, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4109, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4109, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3263}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
