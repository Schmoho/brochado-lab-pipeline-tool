{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is an essential component of transcriptional regulation and RNA processing of protein-coding genes. CTD is implicated in the transcription and processing of RNAPII-mediated small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), but the identity of the complex (or complexes) that associates with the CTD and mediates the processing of snRNAs has been elusive [[cite:PUB00045283]].</p>\r\n<p>An RNA polymerase II complex termed the Integrator, which contains at least 12 novel subunits and core RNAPII subunits has been identified. Two of the Integrator subunits share similarity with subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. Integrator has been shown to be recruited to the U1 and U2 snRNA genes, and to mediate the snRNAs' 3' end processing. The Integrator complex is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans, and directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit [[cite:PUB00045283]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02105" "Integrator complex subunit 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Integrator complex subunit 2, metazoa", "short" "Int2_metazoa"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 939, "taxa" 3796, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11710, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1899, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1140}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026236", :literature {"PUB00045283" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Baillat D" "Hakimi MA" "Naar AM" "Shilatifard A" "Cooch N" "Shiekhattar R."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.019", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Integrator, a multiprotein mediator of small nuclear RNA processing, associates with the C-terminal repeat of RNA polymerase II.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "265-76", "volume" "123", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16239144}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016180", "name" "snRNA processing", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0032039", "name" "integrator complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029321", "name" "Integrator complex subunit 2", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR026236", "name" "Integrator complex subunit 2, metazoa", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
