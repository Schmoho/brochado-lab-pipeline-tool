{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ferredoxin reductase is a member of the flavoprotein pyridine nucleotide cytochrome reductases [[cite:PUB00002674]] (FPNCRs) that catalyse the interchange of reducing equivalents between one-electron carriers and the two-electron-carrying nicotinamide dinucleotides. Ferredoxin reductase catalyzes the final step of electron transfer to make NADPH and ATP in plant chloroplasts during photosynthesis.
