It also plays a key role in the nitrogen fixation pathway in legume root nodules: here it functions in concert with glutamine, glutamate and asparagine synthetases and aspartate amido transferase, to synthesise aspartate and asparagine, the major nitrogen transport compounds in various amine-transporting plant species [[cite:PUB00004559]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the family found primarily in bacteria and plants.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015813", "name" "Pyruvate/Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00595" "Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [ppc]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, bacterial/plant-type", "short" "PEP_COase_bac/pln-type"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4277, "taxa" 17172, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17964, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17964, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13472}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
