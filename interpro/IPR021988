{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of fungal beta-mannosyltransferase that is involved in cell wall biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00086020], [cite:PUB00097614]]. For example, in Candida albicans, BMT1-4 enzymes act stepwise to add beta-mannoses onto cell-wall phosphopeptidomannan (PPM). While Bmt5 and Bmt6 are involved in the addition of the first and third beta-mannoses to phospholipomannan (PLM), respectively [[cite:PUB00097617]]. Furthermore, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BMT5 and BMT6 are responsible for methylation of uridine residues in the 25S rRNA [[cite:PUB00075659]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12141" "Beta-mannosyltransferases"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-mannosyltransferase", "short" "BMT1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 110, "taxa" 411, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 562, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 391}, "pathways" 199}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
