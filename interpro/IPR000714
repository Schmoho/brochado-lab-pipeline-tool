{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The IR5 open reading frame (ORF) of the Equid herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) genome maps within the inverted repeat segments. Sequence analyses of the gene region revealed an ORF of 236 amino acids that showed a high degree of similarity to ORF64 of Human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3) and ORF3 of Equid herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4), both of which map within the inverted repeats, and to the US10 ORF of Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), which maps within the unique short segment. The IR5 ORF houses a sequence of 13 residues (CAYWCCLGHAFAC) that matches perfectly the consensus zinc finger motif (C-X2-4-C-X2-15-C/H-X2-4-C/H) [[cite:PUB00005585]]. Putative cis-acting elements flanking the IR5 ORF include a TATA box, a CAAT box, and a polyadenylation signal. Coupled with various experimental data, the IR5 gene of EHV-1 thus exhibits characteristics representative of a late gene of the gamma-1 class. The DNA sequence covering ~70% of the short unique region (Us) and part of the short inverted repeat of the Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 (MeHV-1) GA strain has been determined. Sequence analysis showed the presence of nine potential ORFs in the Us region, four of which were found to be similar to US10 (minor virion protein) [[cite:PUB00005949]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02053" "Gene 66 (IR5) protein"}, "prints" {"PR00957" "GENE66"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Equine herpesvirus protein of unknown function", "short" "EHV_Unk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 110, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 236, "sets" 0, "proteins" 231, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000714", :literature {"PUB00005585" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Holden VR" "Yalamanchili RR" "Harty RN" "O'Callaghan DJ."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(92)90525-T", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Identification and characterization of an equine herpesvirus 1 late gene encoding a potential zinc finger.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "704-13", "volume" "188", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1316680}, "PUB00005949" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Sakaguchi M" "Urakawa T" "Hirayama Y" "Miki N" "Yamamoto M" "Hirai K."], "ISO_journal" "Virus Genes", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01703085", "medline_journal" "Virus Genes", "title" "Sequence determination and genetic content of an 8.9-kb restriction fragment in the short unique region and the internal inverted repeat of Marek's disease virus type 1 DNA.", "year" 1992, "raw_pages" "365-78", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1282282}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000714", "name" "Equine herpesvirus protein of unknown function", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 23}}}
