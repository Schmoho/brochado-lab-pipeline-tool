{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents CmpA (cortex morphogenetic protein A) found firmicutes, a small protein (37 amino acids) involved in endospore formation. CmpA participates in a quality-control pathway that selectively removes defective sporulating cells through regulated cell death. It acts as an adaptor that delivers SpoIVA to the ClpXP proteolytic machinery for degradation, specifically in cells that improperly assemble the spore envelope [[cite:PUB00151037]]. This protein ensures proper spore envelope assembly [[cite:PUB00105038]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033225" "cortex morphogenetic protein CmpA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cortex morphogenetic protein CmpA", "short" "CmpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 270, "taxa" 832, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 699, "sets" 0, "proteins" 699, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 502}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047764", :literature {"PUB00105038" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Ebmeier SE" "Tan IS" "Clapham KR" "Ramamurthi KS."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "Small proteins link coat and cortex assembly during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "682-96", "volume" "84", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22463703}, "PUB00151037" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Tan IS" "Weiss CA" "Popham DL" "Ramamurthi KS."], "ISO_journal" "Dev Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Dev Cell", "title" "A Quality-Control Mechanism Removes Unfit Cells from a Population of Sporulating Bacteria.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "682-93", "volume" "34", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26387458}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047764", "name" "Cortex morphogenetic protein CmpA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
