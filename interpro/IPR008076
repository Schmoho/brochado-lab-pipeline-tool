{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cyanate hydratase or cyanase lyase catalyses the reaction of cyanate with bicarbonate to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide, allowing the host organisms to overcome the toxicity of environmental cyanate [[cite:PUB00010276]]. The enzyme is also known as cyanate lyase and cyanate hydrolase.</p>\n\n<p>The cyanate lyase monomer is composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain that shows structural similarity to the DNA-binding Î±-helix bundle motif, and a C-terminal domain that has an 'open fold' that shows no structural similarity to other proteins [[cite:PUB00010276]].</p>\n\n<p>The enzyme is active as a homodecamer of 17kDa subunits, and displays half-site binding of substrates or substrate analogues. The dimer structure reveals the C-terminal domains to be intertwined; the decamer is formed from a pentamer of these dimers. The active site of the enzyme is located between dimers and comprises residues from four adjacent subunits of the homodecamer.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8k6g", "name" "Crystal structure of E.coli Cyanase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR010982", "name" "Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036581", "name" "Cyanate lyase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34186" "CYANATE HYDRATASE"}, "prints" {"PR01693" "CYANASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_00535" "Cyanate hydratase [cynS]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00673" "cyanase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF001263" "Cyanate hydratase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cyanate hydratase", "short" "Cyanase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2541, "taxa" 10146, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7761, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7682, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5595}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1072", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1072"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
