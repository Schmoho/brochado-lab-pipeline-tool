{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Baculovirus proteins of around 130 residues in length. The function of members of this family is unknown, but appear to be related to the U-box and ring finger domain by profile-profile comparison.  In the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, ac53 (also known as orf53) is essential for production of infectious budded virus.  Initially distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, ac53 accumulates near the nucleus-cytoplasm boundary.  Deletion does not affect the levels of viral DNA replication but does affect nucleocapsid assembly [[cite:PUB00082615]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05883" "Baculovirus U-box/Ring-like domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Baculovirus U-box/Ring-like", "short" "Baculovirus_U-box/Ring-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 72, "taxa" 215, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 147, "sets" 0, "proteins" 147, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008573", :literature {"PUB00082615" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Liu C" "Li Z" "Wu W" "Li L" "Yuan M" "Pan L" "Yang K" "Pang Y."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.09.003", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus ac53 plays a role in nucleocapsid assembly.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "59-68", "volume" "382", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18851866}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008573", "name" "Baculovirus U-box/Ring-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 46}}}
