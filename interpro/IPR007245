{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class T protein (PIG-T, also known as Gpi16 in budding yeasts) is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) trans-amidase complex that adds GPIs to newly synthesized proteins [[cite:PUB00009845]]. Mammalian GPI transamidase consists of at least five components: Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U, all five of which are required for its function. It is possible that Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T form a tightly associated core that is only weakly associated with PIG-U. The exact function of PIG-S is unclear [[cite:PUB00044439]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04113" "Gpi16 subunit, GPI transamidase component"}, "panther" {"PTHR12959" "GPI TRANSAMIDASE COMPONENT PIG-T-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GPI transamidase component PIG-T", "short" "PIG-T"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 83, "proteomes" 2576, "taxa" 8622, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5804, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5293, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3464}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007245", :literature {"PUB00009845" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Fraering P" "Imhof I" "Meyer U" "Strub JM" "van Dorsselaer A" "Vionnet C" "Conzelmann A."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
