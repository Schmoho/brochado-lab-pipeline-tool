{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase  (also known as microbial transglutaminase, MTG) catalyses an acyl transfer reaction by means of a Cys-Asp diad mechanism, in which the gamma-carboxyamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues act as the acyl donors. The MTG molecule forms a single, compact domain belonging to the α+β folding class, containing 11 α-helices and 8 β-strands. The α-helices and the β-strands are concentrated mainly at the amino and carboxyl ends of the polypeptide, respectively. These secondary structures are arranged so that a β-sheet is surrounded by α-helices, which are clustered into three regions [[cite:PUB00028702]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9ihs", "name" "Microbial transglutaminase mutant - D3C/G283C"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038765", "name" "Papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR037084", "name" "Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09017" "Microbial transglutaminase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037210" "Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase, prokaryotic type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase", "short" "Transglut_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 6, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 110, "sets" 0, "proteins" 110, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 81}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
