{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subgroup of class 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1). GATase activity catalyses the transfer of ammonia from the amide side chain of glutamine to an acceptor substrate. Glutamine amidotransferases (GATase) includes the triad family of amidotransferases which have a conserved Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad in the glutaminase active site. In this subgroup this triad is conserved.</p>\n\n<p>Proteins in this subgroup are mostly from archaea, bacteria, plants and fungi. This entry includes ChyE from Penicillium rubens, YLR126C from budding yeast, GGP1-5 from plants. ChyE converts 2-(2-aminopropanamido)benzoic acid and 2-(2-aminopropanamido)benzamidine into 2-(2-(2-carboxyacetamido)propanamido)benzoic acid and 3-((1-((2-carbamoylphenyl)amino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)amino)-3-oxopropanoic acid, respectively [[cite:PUB00097674]]. In Arabidopsis, GGP1 hydrolyzes the gamma-glutamyl peptide bond of several glutathione (GSH) conjugates to produce Cys-Gly conjugates related to glucosinolates. The gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly-GSH conjugates are the sulfur-donating molecule in glucosinolate biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00097676], [cite:PUB00097675]]. The function of YLR126C is still not clear.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7d54", "name" "Crstal structure MsGATase with Gln"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01741" "Subgroup of proteins having the Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain"}, "panther" {"PTHR42695" "GLUTAMINE AMIDOTRANSFERASE YLR126C-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glutamine amidotransferase domain containing protein ChyE-like", "short" "ChyE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5992, "taxa" 23412, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 33733, "sets" 0, "proteins" 33721, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 25229}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
