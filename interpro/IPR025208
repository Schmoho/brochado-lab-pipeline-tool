{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of bacterial metallo-peptidases is thought to compromise the inflammatory response by degrading p65, thereby down-regulating the NF-kappaB signalling pathway [[cite:PUB00057312]]. NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor which is present in almost all cell types and is involved in many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52; and the heterodimeric p65-p50 complex appears to be most abundant one.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4lgj", "name" "Crystal structure and mechanism of a type III secretion protease"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF13678" "NFkB-p65-degrading zinc protease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NFkB-p65-degrading zinc protease", "short" "Peptidase_M85"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 16, "taxa" 170, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 139, "sets" 0, "proteins" 139, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 83}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025208", :literature {"PUB00057312" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Yen H" "Ooka T" "Iguchi A" "Hayashi T" "Sugimoto N" "Tobe T."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001231", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "NleC, a type III secretion protease, compromises NF-ÎºB activation by targeting p65/RelA.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "e1001231", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21187904}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR025208", "name" "NFkB-p65-degrading zinc protease", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 23}}}
