{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known mediators of intracellular signalling cascades. Excessive production of ROS may, however, lead to oxidative stress, loss of cell function, and ultimately apoptosis or necrosis. A balance between oxidant and antioxidant intracellular systems is hence vital for cell function, regulation, and adaptation to diverse growth conditions. Thioredoxin reductase in conjunction with thioredoxin is a ubiquitous oxidoreductase system with antioxidant and redox regulatory roles. Thioredoxin reductase ([ec:1.8.1.9]) reduces oxidised thioredoxin in the presence of NADPH. Reduced thioredoxin serves as an electron donor for thioredoxin peroxidase which consequently reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>to H<sub>2</sub>O. In mammals, extracellular forms of Trx also have cytokine-like effects. Mammalian TrxR has a highly reactive active site selenocysteine residue resulting in a profound reductive capacity, reducing several substrates in addition to Trx [[cite:PUB00033166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2q0l", "name" "Helicobacter pylori thioredoxin reductase reduced by sodium dithionite in complex with NADP+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01292" "thioredoxin-disulfide reductase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin reductase", "short" "Thioredox_Rdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 55, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9994, "taxa" 37686, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 43095, "sets" 0, "proteins" 43094, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32847}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
