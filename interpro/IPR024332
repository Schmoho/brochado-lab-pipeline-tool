{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The MOZART2 family of proteins (also known as FAM128 and Mitotic-spindle organizing protein 2) operate as part of the gamma-tubulin ring complex, gamma-TuRC, one of the complexes necessary for chromosome segregation. This complex is located at centrosomes and mediates the formation of bipolar spindles in mitosis; it consists of six subunits. However, unlike the other four known subunits, the MOZART proteins, both 1 and 2, do not carry the conserved 'Spc97-Spc98' GCP domain, so the TUBGCP nomenclature cannot be used for it. The exact function of MOZART2 is not clear [[cite:PUB00056001]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12926" "Mitotic-spindle organizing gamma-tubulin ring associated"}, "panther" {"PTHR28578" "MITOTIC-SPINDLE ORGANIZING PROTEIN 2A-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MOZART2 family", "short" "MOZART2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 519, "taxa" 2202, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1047, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1038, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 637}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024332", :literature {"PUB00056001" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5978", "authors" ["Hutchins JR" "Toyoda Y" "Hegemann B" "Poser I" "Heriche JK" "Sykora MM" "Augsburg M" "Hudecz O" "Buschhorn BA" "Bulkescher J" "Conrad C" "Comartin D" "Schleiffer A" "Sarov M" "Pozniakovsky A" "Slabicki MM" "Schloissnig S" "Steinmacher I" "Leuschner M" "Ssykor A" "Lawo S" "Pelletier L" "Stark H" "Nasmyth K" "Ellenberg J" "Durbin R" "Buchholz F" "Mechtler K" "Hyman AA" "Peters JM."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1181348", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Systematic analysis of human protein complexes identifies chromosome segregation proteins.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "593-9", "volume" "328", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20360068}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024332", "name" "MOZART2 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 720}}}
