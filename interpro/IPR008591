{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GINS is a key component of eukaryotic replicative forks. It is part of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) complex, the eukaryotic replicative helicase that unwinds double-stranded DNA at replication forks [[cite:PUB00085132]]. Beside its role as a key component of the CMG complex, GINS mediates a interactions with many replication factors [[cite:PUB00085133], [cite:PUB00085134]].</p>\n\n<p>GINS is composed of four subunits: Sld5, Psf1, Psf2, and Psf3 [[cite:PUB00085132]]. The four subunits are structurally related and are likely to derive from a single protein. They share a common fold made up of an α-helical A domain and a β-rich B domain. Sld5 and Psf1 possess the A domain at the N terminus and the B domain at the C terminus, whereas these two domains are swapped in Psf2 and Psf3 [[cite:PUB00085135]]. All subunits are essential for DNA replication.</p>\n\n<p>This family of proteins represents the Sld5 subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036224", "name" "GINS, helical bundle-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF007764" "GINS complex, Sld5 component"}, "panther" {"PTHR21206" "SLD5 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GINS complex subunit Sld5", "short" "GINS_Sld5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2495, "taxa" 8511, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3991, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3918, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2577}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008591", :literature {"PUB00085133" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Kamada K."], "ISO_journal" "Subcell.
