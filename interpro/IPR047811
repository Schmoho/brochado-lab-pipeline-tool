{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a proteobacterial family of small uncharacterised proteins, of about 40 amino acids in length. They contain a conserved region that is enriched of hydrophobic residues and it constitutes a probable transmembrane Î±-helix. Members of this family are regularly found encoded in the context of much larger cytochrome oxidase complex subunits, particularly in members of the Burkholderiales such as Bordetella pertussis and Burkholderia sp.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038351" "cytochrome oxidase small assembly protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative cytochrome C oxidase assembly protein", "short" "CytC_ox_assmbl_put"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 140, "taxa" 695, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 587, "sets" 0, "proteins" 587, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 414}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047811", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047811", "name" "Putative cytochrome C oxidase assembly protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
