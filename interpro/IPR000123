{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The use of an RNA template to produce DNA, for integration into the host genome and exploitation of a host cell, is a strategy employed in the replication of retroid elements, such as the retroviruses and bacterial retrons. The enzyme catalysing polymerisation is an RNA-directed DNA-polymerase, or reverse trancriptase (RT) ([ec:2.7.7.49]). Reverse transcriptase occurs in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses. The enzymatic reaction leads to the production of a unique RNA-DNA complex called msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA) in which a single-stranded DNA branches out from an RNA molecule via a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage [[cite:PUB00006269]].</p>\n\n<p>Retroviral reverse transcriptase is synthesised as part of the POL polyprotein that contains; an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. The discovery of retroelements in the prokaryotes raises intriguing questions concerning their roles in bacteria and the origin and evolution of reverse transcriptases and whether the bacterial reverse transcriptases are older than eukaryotic reverse transcriptases [[cite:PUB00006358]].</p>\n\n<p>This protein family includes a number of bacterial reverse transcriptases, including Retron Ec73 reverse transcriptase from Escherichia coli and Trt from Bacillus stearothermophilus ([swissprot:E2GM63]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043502", "name" "DNA/RNA polymerase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03487" "RT_Bac_retron_II"}, "prints" {"PR00866" "RNADNAPOLMS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), msDNA", "short" "Reverse_transcriptase_msDNA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1851, "taxa" 9721, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23918, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11229, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8647}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
