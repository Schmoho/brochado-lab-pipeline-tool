{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The novo purine biosynthesis proceeds by two divergent paths. In bacteria, yeasts, and plants, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) is converted to 4-carboxy-AIR (CAIR) by two enzymes: N5-carboxy-AIR (N5-CAIR) synthetase (PurK) and N5-CAIR mutase (class I PurE). In animals, the conversion of AIR to CAIR requires a single enzyme, AIR carboxylase (class II PurE) [[cite:PUB00065601]].
