{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is secreted by Gram-negative Gammaproteobacteria such as Pseudomonas syringae of tomato and Erwinia amylovora (Fire blight bacteria), amongst others. It is an essential pathogenicity factor of approximately 198kDa. Its injection into the host-plant is dependent upon the bacterial type III or Hrp secretion system [[cite:PUB00053336]]. The family is long and carries a number of predicted functional regions, including an ERMS or endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal at both the C- and the N termini, a leucine-zipper motif from residues 539-560, and a nuclear localisation signal at 1358-1361. This conserved AvrE-family of effectors is among the few that are required for full virulence of many phytopathogenic pseudomonads, erwinias and pantoeas [[cite:PUB00053337]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A double β-propeller structure is found towards the N terminus [[cite:PUB00091029]]. Furthermore, AvrE1, an AvrE-family T3E from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000, associates with specific PP2A B- subunit proteins from its susceptible host Arabidopsis. In a similar fashion, the WtsE (AvrE-family T3E from the maize pathogen Pantoea stewartii subsp. Stewartii) has been shown to target maize protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) heterotrimeric enzyme complexes via direct interaction with B- regulatory subunits. Taken together, it has been indicated that that sub-component specific PP2A complexes are targeted by bacterial T3Es, including direct targeting by members of the widely conserved AvrE-family. Additionally, DspE, a type-III effector encoded by the broad-host-range bacterial soft-rot pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc), has been indicated to be required and sufficient for disease-associated cell death in host plants [[cite:PUB00091028]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11725" "AvrE-family Type-III effector proteins (T3Es)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "AvrE-family Type-III effector protein", "short" "AvrE_T3Es"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 38, "taxa" 363, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 535, "sets" 0, "proteins" 500, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 64}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021085", :literature {"PUB00053336" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Bogdanove AJ" "Bauer DW" "Beer SV."], "ISO_journal" "J.
