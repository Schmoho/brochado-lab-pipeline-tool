{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes proteins with a hyaluronan/mRNA-binding protein domain, including HABP4 hyaluronan-binding proteins, PAI-RBP1 (also known as SERBP1) and related sequences.</p>\n\n<p>HABP4 binds hyaluronan (a glucosaminoglycan), but according to its intracellular localisation, it may not be relevant in vivo. It has binds RNA and regulates transcription and pre-mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00053771], [cite:PUB00053772], [cite:PUB00155126], [cite:PUB00076293], [cite:PUB00008623]].</p>\n\n<p>SERBP1 is a ribosome-binding protein that promotes ribosome hibernation, a process during which ribosomes are stabilised in an inactive state and preserved from proteasomal degradation [[cite:PUB00155128]]. It acts via its association with EEF2/eEF2 factor, sequestering EEF2/eEF2 at the A-site of the ribosome and promoting ribosome stabilisation and storage in an inactive state and it may also play a role in the regulation of mRNA stability: binds to the 3'-most 134 nt of the SERPINE1/PAI1 mRNA, a region which confers cyclic nucleotide regulation of message decay [[cite:PUB00008624]]. It seems to play a role in PML-nuclear bodies formation [[cite:PUB00155127]]. The orthologue from S. pombe, oga-1, is a ribosome preservation factor that protects a small pool of nontranslating, vacant ribosomes in cells under nutrient starvation conditions. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, cells reduce ribosome biogenesis and degrade ribosomes via autophagy (ribophagy) or proteasomal degradation. It binds specifically G4 quadruplex (these are four-stranded right-handed helices, stabilised by guanine base quartets) and purine motif triplex (characterised by a third, antiparallel purine-rich DNA strand located within the major groove of a homopurine stretch of duplex DNA) nucleic acid structures. These structures may be present at telomeres or in rRNAs. Extends chronological lifespan when overexpressed [[cite:PUB00151550]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12299" "HYALURONIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA binding protein HABP4/SERBP1-like", "short" "HABP4/SERBP1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 36, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2347, "taxa" 8156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6988, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6988, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4511}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039764", :literature {"PUB00076293" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Goncalves Kde A" "Bressan GC" "Saito A" "Morello LG" "Zanchin NI" "Kobarg J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.07.010", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "Evidence for the association of the human regulatory protein Ki-1/57 with the translational machinery.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "2556-60", "volume" "585", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21771594}, "PUB00155126" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Bressan GC" "Quaresma AJ" "Moraes EC" "Manfiolli AO" "Passos DO" "Gomes MD" "Kobarg J."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07092.x", "medline_journal" "FEBS J", "title" "Functional association of human Ki-1/57 with pre-mRNA splicing events.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3770-83", "volume" "276", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19523114}, "PUB00155127" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Saito A" "Souza EE" "Costa FC" "Meirelles GV" "Goncalves KA" "Santos MT" "Bressan GC" "McComb ME" "Costello CE" "Whelan SA" "Kobarg J."], "ISO_journal" "J Proteome Res", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00001", "medline_journal" "J Proteome Res", "title" "Human Regulatory Protein Ki-1/57 Is a Target of SUMOylation and Affects PML Nuclear Body Formation.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "3147-3157", "volume" "16", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28695742}, "PUB00155128" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Shetty S" "Hofstetter J" "Battaglioni S" "Ritz D" "Hall MN."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112344", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "TORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits the ribosomeÂ preservation factor Stm1 to activate dormant ribosomes.", "year" 2023, "raw_pages" "e112344", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36691768}, "PUB00008624" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Heaton JH" "Dlakic WM" "Dlakic M" "Gelehrter TD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
