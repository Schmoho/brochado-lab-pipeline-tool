{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes guanine deaminase, which hydrolyses guanine to xanthine and ammonia, the first step to utilize guanine as a nitrogen source. Xanthine can then be converted to urate by xanthine dehydrogenase. This reaction also removes the guanine base from the pool and therefore can play a role in the regulation of cellular GTP and the guanylate nucleotide pool [[cite:PUB00034599], [cite:PUB00081356], [cite:PUB00081357]]. In some bacteria, the guanine deaminase gene is found near the xdhABC genes for xanthine dehydrogenase. Non-homologous forms of guanine deaminase also exist, as well as more distantly related homologues which are not included in this entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6oh9", "name" "Yeast Guanine Deaminase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032466", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR011059", "name" "Metal-dependent hydrolase, composite domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01303" "GDEase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02967" "guanine deaminase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine deaminase", "short" "Guanine_deaminase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3443, "taxa" 13577, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11317, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11317, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8311}, "pathways" 12}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0698", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0698"} {"accession" "GenProp1469", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1469"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
