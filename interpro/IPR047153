{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of animal proteins defined by the TRIM/RBCC motif, including TRIM45/56/19 [[cite:PUB00102048], [cite:PUB00102049], [cite:PUB00102047]]. These protein have been shown to act as SUMO E3 ligases and play important roles in a variety of cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, development, oncogenesis, and apoptosis. TRIM45 may act as a transcriptional repressor in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway [[cite:PUB00102049]]; TRIM56 plays a key role in innate antiviral immunity by mediating ubiquitination of CGAS and STING1 [[cite:PUB00102050], [cite:PUB00102047]]. TRIM19, also known as PML, acts its association with PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in a wide range of important cellular processes, such as tumor suppression, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, senescence, DNA damage response, and viral defense mechanisms. It acts as the scaffold of PML-NBs allowing other proteins to shuttle in and out, a process which is regulated by SUMO-mediated modifications and interactions. PML exhibits antiviral activity as it stimulates the SUMOylation of a viral protein which is supposed to serve as a cellular mechanism to compromise specific functions of the viral effector IE1p72 [[cite:PUB00102048]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5yuf", "name" "Crystal Structure of PML RING tetramer"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR25462" "BONUS, ISOFORM C-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TRIM45/56/19-like", "short" "TRIM45/56/19-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1233, "taxa" 5028, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 20503, "sets" 0, "proteins" 20503, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10856}, "pathways" 31}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
