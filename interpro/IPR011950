Pyrococcus species appear to have three different forms of this enzyme, so it is unclear whether all members of this family have the same function. This family is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases which are characterised by three conserved sequence motifs.  By virtue of an Î± helical domain in-between the first and second conserved motif, this family is a member of subfamily IA  [[cite:PUB00003337]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1x42", "name" "Crystal structure of a haloacid dehalogenase family protein (PH0459) from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02253" "TIGR02253 family HAD-type hydrolase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HAD-superfamily hydrolase, subfamily IA, CTE7", "short" "HAD-SF_hydro_IA_CTE7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 536, "taxa" 2518, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1380, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1380, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 987}, "pathways" 39}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1737", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1737"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
