{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is found in eukaryotes, and is typically between 61 and 73 amino acids in length. They are suggested to be transcription factor proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Xenopus laevis, doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1a (dmrt1-a) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in male sex determination and differentiation by controlling testis development and germ cell proliferation. It acts both as a transcription repressor and activator [[cite:PUB00060804], [cite:PUB00060805]]. However, the other family member in Xenopus laevis, doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor DM-W (dm-w), is a transcription factor that plays a key role in female sex determination and primary ovary development. It acts as a sex-determining protein by antagonizing the transcriptional activity of male-determination protein dmrt1-a, acting as a dominant-negative type protein [[cite:PUB00060806], [cite:PUB00060805]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12374" "Double-sex mab3 related transcription factor 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1-like", "short" "DMRT1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 520, "taxa" 2121, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1308, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 924}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022114", :literature {"PUB00060804" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Yoshimoto S" "Okada E" "Oishi T" "Numagami R" "Umemoto H" "Tamura K" "Kanda H" "Shiba T" "Takamatsu N" "Ito M."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
