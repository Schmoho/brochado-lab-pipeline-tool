{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Siderophores are produced in various bacteria (and some plants) to extract iron from hosts. This entry represents a group of siderophore-interacting proteins, including ViuB and VuuB from Vibrio cholerae and YqjH from E. coli. ViuB is a putative siderophore-interacting protein (SIP) [[cite:PUB00089554]], functionally substituted for the E. coli ferric reductase YqjH, which promotes the release of iron from the siderophore in the bacterial cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00089553]]. VuuB is a ferric-siderophore reductase involved in iron removal from the siderophores after their transport into the cell. It acts as a major ferric-vulnibactin reductase catalysing the reduction of Fe3+-vulnibactin, a catecholate siderophore synthesized by V.vulnificus. It catalyses reduction of Fe3+-aerobactin, a citrate-hydroxamate siderophore produced by other bacteria, in the absence of IutB [[cite:PUB00151532], [cite:PUB00151533]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6tek", "name" "Structure of siderophore interaction domain of IrtAB"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30157" "FERRIC REDUCTASE, NADPH-DEPENDENT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Siderophore-interacting protein", "short" "SIP_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3152, "taxa" 11880, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21728, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21728, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17061}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
