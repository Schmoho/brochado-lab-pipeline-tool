{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This subset of the radical-SAM domain includes a number of probable activating proteins acting on different enzymes all requiring an amino-acid-centred radical. The closest relatives to this family are the pyruvate-formate lyase activating enzyme (PflA, [ec:1.97.1.4], [interpro:IPR012838]) and the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activating enzyme ([interpro:IPR012837]). Included within this subfamily are activators of hydroxyphenyl acetate decarboxylase (HdpA, [[cite:PUB00016705]]), benzylsuccinate synthase (BssD, [[cite:PUB00016708]]), gycerol dehydratase (DhaB2, [[cite:PUB00016707]]), trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase (pflE, [[cite:PUB00090957]]) as well as enzymes annotated in Escherichia coli as activators of different isozymes of pyruvate-formate lyase (PFLC and PFLE) however, these appear to lack characterisation and may activate enzymes with distinctive functions. Most of the sequence-level variability between these forms is concentrated within an N-terminal domain, which follows a conserved group of three cysteines and contains a variable pattern of 0 to 8 additional cysteines.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8fsi", "name" "The structure of a crystallizable variant of E. coli pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme bound to SAM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000371" "Predicted pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme with radical SAM domain, YjjW type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Organic radical enzyme activase", "short" "Organic_radical_activase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1904, "taxa" 9237, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19960, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16054, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12117}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
