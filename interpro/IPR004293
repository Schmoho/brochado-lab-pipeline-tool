{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are non-structural proteins that are found in alphacoronavirus, including Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). These proteins are found on the same mRNA as another product, designated ORF3a and they are referred to as 3a-like accessory proteins found in multiple alpha and betacoronavirus lineages that infect bats and humans. They are transmembrane proteins of the viroporin family that form ion channels in the host membrane and have been implicated in inducing apoptosis, pathogenicity, and virus release  [[cite:PUB00007472], [cite:PUB00007473], [cite:PUB00100945]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03053" "ORF3b coronavirus protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Coronavirus Orf3a/b", "short" "Coronavirus_Orf3a/b"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 20, "taxa" 246, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1365, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1364, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004293", :literature {"PUB00007472" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Kim L" "Hayes J" "Lewis P" "Parwani AV" "Chang KO" "Saif LJ."], "ISO_journal" "Arch.
