{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry consists of proteins from eukaryotes and prokarytotes. It includes Escherichia coli autoinducer-2 (AI-2) transport protein TqsA (YdgG), which controls the transport of the quorum-sensing signal AI-2 either by enhancing its secretion or inhibiting its uptake and consequently represses biofilm formation and motility and affects the global gene expression in biofilms [[cite:PUB00076990]]. TqsA exhibit a uniform topology with 8 putative transmembrane segments (TMSs), a structure shared by proteins in this family. The function of proteins in this family are mostly unknown, however, it has been suggested that they may transport a variety of compounds, possibly all related in structure [[cite:PUB00076989]]. This entry also includes transport proteins such as sodium-lithium/proton antiporter from Halobacillus [[cite:PUB00086646]] and sporulation protein YtvI from Bacillus subtilis, a putative permease [[cite:PUB00012907]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised transmembrane protein 245 (TMEM245) from eukaryotes.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01594" "AI-2E family transporter"}, "panther" {"PTHR21716" "TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transmembrane protein TqsA-like", "short" "AI-2E-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 142, "proteomes" 10525, "taxa" 42591, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 117323, "sets" 0, "proteins" 116333, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 88888}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002549", :literature {"PUB00076989" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Rettner RE" "Saier MH Jr."], "ISO_journal" "J.
