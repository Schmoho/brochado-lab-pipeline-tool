{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins (previously known as FAM72) that is distantly related to and named after the drosophila Yippee, a zinc-binding protein [[cite:PUB00020578]].  In contrast to the other Yippee-like proteins ([interpro:IPR004910] , [interpro:IPR021673], [interpro:IPR007515]) [[cite:PUB00078711]], this family of proteins possesses some distinct features such as the presence of a second putative zinc binding site that is unique to them. The constituent zinc coordinating residues of this second site are invariant within the family suggesting that this is likely a genuine zinc binding site.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14976" "Yippee homolog 2 zinc finger protein"}, "panther" {"PTHR31841" "PROTEIN FAM72A-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Yippee homolog double zinc finger protein", "short" "YPEH2ZP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 23, "proteomes" 973, "taxa" 3272, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1623, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1599, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1039}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026768", :literature {"PUB00020578" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Roxstrom-Lindquist K" "Faye I."], "ISO_journal" "Insect Mol.
