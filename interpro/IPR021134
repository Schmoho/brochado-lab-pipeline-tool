{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bestrophin is a 68kDa basolateral plasma membrane protein expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). It is encoded by the VMD2 gene, which is mutated in Best macular dystrophy, a disease characterised by a depressed light peak in the electrooculogram [[cite:PUB00011864]]. VMD2 encodes a 585-amino acid protein with an approximate mass of 68kDa which has been designated bestrophin. Bestrophin shares homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans RFP gene family, named for the presence of a conserved arginine (R), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), amino acid sequence motif. Bestrophin is a plasma membrane protein, localised to the basolateral surface of RPE cells consistent with a role for bestrophin in the generation or regulation of the EOG light peak. Bestrophin and other RFP family members represent a new class of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC) [[cite:PUB00096752]], indicating a direct role for bestrophin in generating the light peak [[cite:PUB00011864], [cite:PUB00096747], [cite:PUB00096748]]. Bestrophins are also permeable to other monovalent anions including bicarbonate, bromine, iodine, thiocyanate an nitrate [[cite:PUB00096752], [cite:PUB00096748]]. Structural analysis revealed that N-terminal region of the proteins is highly conserved and sufficient for its CaCC activity. The C-terminal region has low sequence identity. The VMD2 gene underlying Best disease was shown to represent the first human member of the RFP-TM protein family. More than 97% of the disease-causing mutations are located in the N-terminal domain altering the electrophysiological properties of the channel [[cite:PUB00096752], [cite:PUB00011865]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry also includes bestrophin homologues from bacteria and plants, formerly known as UPF0187 family members, including Voltage-dependent anion channel-forming protein YneE from E.coli and VCCN1/2 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00103560], [cite:PUB00103559]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8d1n", "name" "bBest2_345 Ca2+-bound open state"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01062" "Bestrophin, RFP-TM, chloride channel"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bestrophin-like", "short" "Bestrophin-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 52, "domain_architectures" 294, "proteomes" 4100, "taxa" 16228, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 30318, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28159, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19888}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR021134", :literature {"PUB00011864" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Stohr H" "Marquardt A" "Nanda I" "Schmid M" "Weber BH."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
