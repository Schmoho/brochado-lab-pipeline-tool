{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Amidated peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria is essential for peptidoglycan (PG) cross-linking, playing an important role in homeostasis, antibiotic resistance and cell survival. The bi-enzymatic complex MurT-GatD catalyses the amidation process in PG stem peptides, in which GatD is the glutamine amidotransferase member. GatD metabolises glutamine and provides ammonia to MurT, the ligase that catalises the convertion of D-glutamate residue in Lipid II to D-isoglutamine. Sequence analysis of this subunit from S. aureus is similar to the catalytic domain in CobB/CobQ-like glutamine amidotransferases (GatD) (enzymes involved in cobalamin biosynthesis), being grouped in a new sub-family of glutamine amidotransferases [[cite:PUB00094477], [cite:PUB00094478]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5n9m", "name" "Crystal structure of GatD - a glutamine amidotransferase from Staphylococcus aureus involved in peptidoglycan amidation"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029062", "name" "Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_02213" "Lipid II isoglutaminyl synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) subunit GatD [gatD]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipid II isoglutaminyl synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) subunit GatD", "short" "Lipid_II_synth_GatD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2137, "taxa" 8134, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8170, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8170, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6323}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
