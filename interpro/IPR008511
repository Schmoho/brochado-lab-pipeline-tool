{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes a family of proteins such as protein BYPASS1-LIKE [[cite:PUB00151119]], protein ROH1 [[cite:PUB00093724]] and related proteins that are involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. ROH1 is an interactor of the exocyst subunit Exo70A1, and has been shown to be required for seed coat mucilage deposition [[cite:PUB00151121]]. BYPASS1-LIKE prevents plant growth and development and regulates positively cold tolerance [[cite:PUB00151122]]. It also regulates lateral root initiation via exocytic vesicular trafficking-mediated PIN recycling [[cite:PUB00151120]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05633" "Protein ROH1-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein ROH1-like", "short" "ROH1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 58, "proteomes" 247, "taxa" 1249, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3396, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3059, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1768}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008511", :literature {"PUB00093724" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kulich I" "Cole R" "Drdova E" "Cvrckova F" "Soukup A" "Fowler J" "Zarsky V."], "ISO_journal" "New Phytol.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "New Phytol", "title" "Arabidopsis exocyst subunits SEC8 and EXO70A1 and exocyst interactor ROH1 are involved in the localized deposition of seed coat pectin.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "615-25", "volume" "188", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20618910}, "PUB00151122" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chen T" "Zhang W" "Yang G" "Chen JH" "Chen BX" "Sun R" "Zhang H" "An LZ."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "BMC Plant Biol", "title" "TRANSTHYRETIN-LIKE and BYPASS1-LIKE co-regulate growth and cold tolerance in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "332", "volume" "20", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32664862}, "PUB00151120" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Yang G" "Chen BX" "Chen T" "Chen JH" "Lin XY" "Yue XL" "An LZ" "Zhang H."], "ISO_journal" "J Integr Plant Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Integr Plant Biol", "title" "BYPASS1-LIKE regulates lateral root initiation via exocytic vesicular trafficking-mediated PIN recycling in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "965-978", "volume" "64", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35249253}, "PUB00151121" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Saccomanno A" "Potocky M" "Pejchar P" "Hala M" "Shikata H" "Schwechheimer C" "Zarsky V."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "Regulation of Exocyst Function in Pollen Tube Growth by Phosphorylation of Exocyst Subunit EXO70C2.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "609600", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33519861}, "PUB00151119" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Chen T" "Chen JH" "Zhang W" "Yang G" "Yu LJ" "Li DM" "Li B" "Sheng HM" "Zhang H" "An LZ."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "BYPASS1-LIKE, A DUF793 Family Protein, Participates in Freezing Tolerance <i>via</i> the CBF Pathway in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "807", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31297122}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR008511", "name" "Protein ROH1-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 1719}}}
