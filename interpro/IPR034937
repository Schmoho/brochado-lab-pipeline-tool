Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase is an aromatic ring opening dioxygenase belonging to the class III extradiol enzyme family, a group of enyzmes that cleaves aromatic rings between a hydroxylated carbon and an adjacent non-hydroxylated carbon using a non-heme Fe(II) [[cite:PUB00080817]]. LigAB is composed of two subunits, designated A and B, which form a tetramer composed of two copies of each subunit. The B subunit (LigB) is the catalytic subunit of LigAB  [[cite:PUB00011779]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07364" "Subunit B of the Class III extradiol dioxygenase, Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidization and subsequent ring-opening of protocatechuate"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase beta chain", "short" "PCA_45_Dioxygenase_B"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 178, "taxa" 782, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 617, "sets" 0, "proteins" 617, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 445}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
