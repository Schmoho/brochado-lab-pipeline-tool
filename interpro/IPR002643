{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of the DNA-binding protein or agnoprotein from various polyomaviruses. This protein is highly basic and can bind single stranded and double stranded DNA [[cite:PUB00003976]]. Mutations in the agnoprotein produce smaller viral plaques, hence its function is not essential for growth in tissue culture cells but something has slowed in the normal replication cycle [[cite:PUB00003480]]. There is also evidence suggesting that the agnogene and agnoprotein act as regulators of structural protein synthesis [[cite:PUB00003480]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01736" "Polyomavirus agnoprotein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyomavirus agnoprotein", "short" "Polyoma_agno"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 27, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 163, "sets" 0, "proteins" 163, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002643", :literature {"PUB00003976" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5813", "authors" ["Jay G" "Nomura S" "Anderson CW" "Khoury G."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/291346a0", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Identification of the SV40 agnogene product: a DNA binding protein.", "year" 1981, "raw_pages" "346-9", "volume" "291", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 6262654}, "PUB00003480" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Hou-Jong MH" "Larsen SH" "Roman A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
