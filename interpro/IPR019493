{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacteriocins are proteinaceous toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of similar or closely related strains. The producer bacteria are protected from the effects of their own bacteriocins by production of a specific immunity protein which is co-transcribed with the genes encoding the bacteriocins, e.g. [interpro:IPR015046]. The bacteriocins are structurally more specific than their immunity-protein counterparts. Typically, production of the bacteriocin gene is from within an operon carrying up to 6 genes including a typical two-component regulatory system (R and H), a small peptide pheromone (C), and a dedicated ABC transporter (A and -B) as well as an immunity protein [[cite:PUB00044165]]. The ABC transporter is thought to recognise the N termini of both the pheromone and the bacteriocins and to transport these peptides across the cytoplasmic membrane, concurrent with cleavage at the conserved double-glycine motif. Cleaved extracellular C can then bind to the sensor kinase, H, resulting in activation of R and up-regulation of the entire gene cluster via binding to consensus sequences within each promoter [[cite:PUB00044166]]. It seems likely that the whole regulon is carried on a transmissible plasmid which is passed between closely related Firmicute species since many clinical isolates from different Firmicutes can produce at least two bacteriocins, and the same bacteriocins can be produced by different species.</p>\n\n<p>The proteins in this entry include amylovorin-L, lactacin-F subunit LafA and  subunit LafX all of them class IIb two-peptide bacteriocins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10439" "Bacteriocin class II with double-glycine leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriocin, class IIb, lactacin-related", "short" "Bacteriocin_IIb_lactacin-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 51, "taxa" 540, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 859, "sets" 0, "proteins" 859, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 711}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019493", :literature {"PUB00044165" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Dawid S" "Roche AM" "Weiser JN."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
