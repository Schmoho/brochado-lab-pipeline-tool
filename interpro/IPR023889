{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins of around 1350 in length. They are found in multiple species of Burkholderia, in Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli AAC00-1 and Delftia acidovorans SPH-1, and in multiple copies in Sorangium cellulosum, in genomic neighbourhoods that include a cyclodehydratase/docking scaffold fusion protein and a member of the thiazole/oxazole modified metabolite (TOMM) precursor family. The proteins have a kinase domain in their N-terminal 300 amino acids, followed by a cyclase homology domain, followed by regions without named domain definitions. They are probable bacteriocin-like metabolite biosynthesis proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03903" "TOMM system kinase/cyclase fusion protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "TOMM system kinase/cyclase fusion protein", "short" "TOMM_kin_cyc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 51, "taxa" 369, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 310, "sets" 0, "proteins" 310, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0901", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0901"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023889", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR023889", "name" "TOMM system kinase/cyclase fusion protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
