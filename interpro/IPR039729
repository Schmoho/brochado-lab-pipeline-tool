{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>One of the hallmarks of the terminal stages of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA breakdown. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) are responsible for this process. DFF exists in the nucleus as a heterodimer composed of a 45kDa chaperone and inhibitor subunit (DFF45, also called ICAD-L) and a 40kDa latent nuclease subunit (DFF40/CAD). Apoptotic activation of caspase-3 or -7 results in the cleavage of DFF45 and release of active DFF40 nuclease, which forms homo-oligomers. DFF40's nuclease activity is further activated by proteins such as histone H1, HMGB1/2, and topoisomerase II [[cite:PUB00090023]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents DFF40 (also known as DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta), which is an apoptotic nuclease that digests chromatin to yield 3'-hydroxyl groups and 5'-phosphate residues [[cite:PUB00090023]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5xpc", "name" "Crystal Structure of Drep4 CIDE domain"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044925", "name" "His-Me finger superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13067" "CASPASE-ACTIVATED DNASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA fragmentation factor 40", "short" "DFF40"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 789, "taxa" 3190, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1379, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1379, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 914}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039729", :literature {"PUB00090023" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Widlak P" "Garrard WT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
