These functions depend on the various FeS cluster prosthetic groups, the most common being [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] [[cite:PUB00035635]]. FeS cluster assembly is a complex process involving the mobilisation of Fe and S atoms from storage sources, their assembly into [Fe-S] form, their transport to specific cellular locations, and their transfer to recipient apoproteins. So far, three FeS assembly machineries have been identified, which are capable of synthesising all types of [Fe-S] clusters: ISC (iron-sulphur cluster), SUF (sulphur assimilation), and NIF (nitrogen fixation) systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SUF system is an alternative pathway to the ISC system that operates under iron starvation and oxidative stress. It is found in eubacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (plastids). The SUF system is encoded by the suf operon (sufABCDSE), and the six encoded proteins are arranged into two complexes (SufSE and SufBCD) and one protein (SufA). SufS is a pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) protein displaying cysteine desulphurase activity. SufE acts as a scaffold protein that accepts S from SufS and donates it to SufA [[cite:PUB00035639]]. SufC is an ATPase with an unorthodox ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-like component. SufA is homologous to IscA [[cite:PUB00035640]], acting as a scaffold protein in which Fe and S atoms are assembled into [FeS] cluster forms, which can then easily be transferred to apoproteins targets.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1vh4", "name" "Crystal structure of a stabilizer of iron transporter"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037284", "name" "SUF system FeS cluster assembly, SufBD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30508" "FES CLUSTER ASSEMBLY PROTEIN SUF", "PTHR43575" "PROTEIN ABCI7, CHLOROPLASTIC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "SUF system FeS cluster assembly, SufBD", "short" "Fe-S_cluster_assembly_SufBD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8009, "taxa" 32475, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 70212, "sets" 0, "proteins" 70212, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 53739}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055346", :literature {"PUB00035635" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Barras F" "Loiseau L" "Py B."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
