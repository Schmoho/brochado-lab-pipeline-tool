{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group uncharacterised proteins that show sequence similarity to Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) [[cite:PUB00102370]]. Members of this group contain a conserved cysteine that aligns to the first cysteine in the CXXC motif of TRX. This does not correspond to the peroxidatic cysteine found in PRXs, which aligns to the second cysteine in the CXXC motif of TRX. In addition, these proteins do not contain the other two conserved residues of the catalytic triad of PRX. PRXs confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ywi", "name" "Crystal structure of uncharacterized conserved protein from Geobacillus kaustophilus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036249", "name" "Thioredoxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd02969" "PRX_like1"}, "panther" {"PTHR43640" "OS07G0260300 PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peroxiredoxin-like 1", "short" "PRX-like1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2875, "taxa" 12048, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 18452, "sets" 0, "proteins" 18442, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13487}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047262", :literature {"PUB00102370" {"URL" nil, "issue" "38", "authors" ["Fomenko DE" "Gladyshev VN."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Identity and functions of CxxC-derived motifs.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "11214-25", "volume" "42", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14503871}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047262", "name" "Peroxiredoxin-like 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
