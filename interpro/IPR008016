{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the upper collar protein (also known as portal protein Gp10) from various bacteriophage. The upper collar protein of Bacteriophage phi-29 is composed of twelve 36kDa subunits with 12-fold symmetry. It consists of two domains: an α-helical bundle domain and a β-barrel domain. This protein is located between the head and the tail of the bacteriophage and acts as the central component of a rotary motor that packages the genomic dsDNA into pre-formed proheads. This motor consists of the upper collar protein, surrounded by a 29-encoded, 174-base, RNA and a viral ATPase protein [[cite:PUB00010495], [cite:PUB00077561]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036199", "name" "Portal protein Gp10 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05352" "Phage Connector (GP10)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Portal protein Gp10", "short" "Gp10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 68, "taxa" 557, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 413, "sets" 0, "proteins" 413, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 131}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008016", :literature {"PUB00010495" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Ackermann HW."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
