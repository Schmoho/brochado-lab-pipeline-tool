{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX29 is a DExH-box protein involved in eukaryotic translation initiation. Eukaryotic translation initiation begins with assembly of a 43S preinitiation complex which then attaches to the mRNA and starts scanning the 5'-UTR to the initiation codon. DHX29 is required to bind to the 40S subunit of the 43S preinitiation complex to allow highly structured 5'-UTRs to be scanned. DHX29 has been shown to hydrolyze ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP, and promotes 48S complex formation [[cite:PUB00084240], [cite:PUB00084241]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03068" "ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX29 [DHX29]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX29", "short" "DHX29"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 459, "taxa" 1659, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 864, "sets" 0, "proteins" 864, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 74}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
