{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gluconate kinase ([ec:2.7.1.12]) has an α/β structure consisting of a twisted parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices with overall topology similar to nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases, such as adenylate kinase. Significant conformational changes are induced upon binding of ATP to the enzyme. The largest changes involve a hinge-bending motion of the NMP(bind) part and a motion of the LID with adjacent helices, which opens the cavity to the second substrate, gluconate. The opening of the active site cleft upon ATP binding is the opposite of what has been observed in the NMP kinase family so far, which usually close their active site to prevent fortuitous hydrolysis of ATP. The beta and gamma-phosphate groups of ATP bind in the predicted P-loop. A conserved lysine side-chain interacts with the gamma-phosphate group, and might promote phosphoryl transfer. <reaction>ATP + D-gluconate = ADP + 6-phospho-D-gluconate.</reaction>Gluconate-6-phosphate binds with its phosphate group in a similar position as the gamma-phosphate of ATP, consistent with inline phosphoryl transfer [[cite:PUB00007925]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01314" "gluconokinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gluconate kinase", "short" "Gluconate_kinase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 422, "taxa" 1719, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2013, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2013, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1397}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
