{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of the nucleic acid/nucleotide deaminase superfamily prototyped by Burkholderia BURPS668_1122 [[cite:PUB00057473]]. Members of this family are found as toxins in polymorphic toxin systems in a wide range of bacteria and in the eukaryote Perkinsus. Members of this family typically possess a DxE catalytic motif in Helix-2 of the core fold instead of the more common C[H]xE motif.  The Perkinsus versions are predicted to be inactive [[cite:PUB00057473]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF14424" "The BURPS668_1122 family of deaminases"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deaminases, BURPS668_1122 family", "short" "Toxin-deaminase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 86, "proteomes" 172, "taxa" 1242, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 885, "sets" 0, "proteins" 885, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 489}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR032721", :literature {"PUB00057473" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Iyer LM" "Zhang D" "Rogozin IB" "Aravind L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr691", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Evolution of the deaminase fold and multiple origins of eukaryotic editing and mutagenic nucleic acid deaminases from bacterial toxin systems.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "9473-97", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21890906}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR032721", "name" "Deaminases, BURPS668_1122 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 6, "alignment:full" 198}}}
