{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Synucleins are small, soluble proteins expressed primarily in neural tissue and in certain tumors [[cite:PUB00001947], [cite:PUB00007113]]. The family includes three known proteins: alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein, and gamma-synuclein. All synucleins have in common a highly conserved Î±-helical lipid-binding motif with similarity to the class-A2 lipid-binding domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins [[cite:PUB00007114]].</p>\n\n<p>Synuclein family members are not found outside vertebrates, although they have some conserved structural similarity with plant 'late-embryo-abundant' proteins. The alpha- and beta-synuclein proteins are found primarily in brain tissue, where they are seen mainly in presynaptic terminals [[cite:PUB00007115], [cite:PUB00007116]]. The gamma-synuclein protein is found primarily in the peripheral nervous system and retina, but its expression in breast tumors [[cite:PUB00006535]] is a marker for tumor progression [[cite:PUB00007117]]. Normal cellular functions have not been determined for any of the synuclein proteins, although some data suggest a role in the regulation of membrane stability and/or turnover. Mutations in alpha-synuclein are associated with rare familial cases of early-onset Parkinson's disease, and the protein accumulates abnormally in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and several other neurodegenerative illnesses [[cite:PUB00007118]].</p>\n\n<p>Beta-synuclein, also known as PNP 14, is expressed in the brain, specifically in synapses around neurons, but not in glial cells. The protein, which has been designated a phosphoneuroprotein, has been found to be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo [[cite:PUB00006114]]. It is believed that the physiological functions of beta-synuclein may be controlled by the phosphorylation reaction.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01213" "BSYNUCLEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-synuclein", "short" "Synuclein_beta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 541, "taxa" 1848, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 842, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 582}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002461", :literature {"PUB00007118" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Goedert M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
