{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gap junction alpha-3 protein (also called connexin46, or Cx46) is a connexin of ~415 amino acid residues. The bovine form is slightly shorter (401 residues) and is hence known as Cx44, having a molecular mass of ~44 kD. Cx46 (together with Cx50) is a connexin isoform expressed in the lens fibres of the eye. Here, gap junctions join the cells into a functional syncytium, and also couple the fibres to the epithelial cells on the anterior surface of the lens. The lens fibres depend on this epithelium for their metabolic support, since they lose their intra-cellular organelles, and accumulate high concentrations of crystallins, in order to produce their optical transparency. Genetically-engineered mice deficient in Cx46 demonstrate the importance of Cx46 in forming lens fibre gap junctions; these mice develop normal lenses, but subsequently develop early onset senile-type cataracts that resemble human nuclear cataracts. Aberrant proteolysis of crystallin proteins was observed in the lenses of Cx46-null mice [[cite:PUB00087465]]. A Cx46 mutant in a highly conserved threonine has been linked to autosomal dominant cataracts. This mutation causes loss of gap junction function and alters hemi-channel gating [[cite:PUB00087466]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038359", "name" "Connexin, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR034634", "name" "Connexin, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01133" "CONNEXINA3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gap junction alpha-3 protein (Cx46)", "short" "Connexin46"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 97, "taxa" 402, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 340, "sets" 0, "proteins" 131, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 81}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002262", :literature {"PUB00087465" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Gong X" "Li E" "Klier G" "Huang Q" "Wu Y" "Lei H" "Kumar NM" "Horwitz J" "Gilula NB."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80471-7", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Disruption of alpha3 connexin gene leads to proteolysis and cataractogenesis in mice.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "833-43", "volume" "91", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9413992}, "PUB00087466" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tong JJ" "Minogue PJ" "Kobeszko M" "Beyer EC" "Berthoud VM" "Ebihara L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
