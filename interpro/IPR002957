{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Keratins are a well known group of intermediate filament proteins. Like actin filaments, keratins are flexible but provide a firm cell skeleton [[cite:PUB00101480]]. Unlike actin, however, no known keratins are associated with motor functions. Approximately 10 keratins form the basis of hair or claw, with a further 20 found in internal body cavity epithelia. They are also found at desmosomes and hemi-desmosomes (cell/cell and cell/matrix contacts respectively). Type I keratins are a group of acidic intermediate filament proteins that exist as chains of hetero-dimers with basic type II keratins. Each type I keratin consists of head-, rod- and tail-like structures, the rod being constructed from three linked coils: 1A, 1B and 2. Type I proteins are associated with a number of inherited developmental disorders, such as baldness, beading of hair, and skin blistering.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23239" "INTERMEDIATE FILAMENT"}, "prints" {"PR01248" "TYPE1KERATIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Keratin, type I", "short" "Keratin_I"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 665, "taxa" 2518, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 2, "matches" 29851, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21316, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14182}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002957", :literature {"PUB00101480" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Zernov NV" "Skoblov MY" "Marakhonov AV" "Shimomura Y" "Vasilyeva TA" "Konovalov FA" "Abrukova AV" "Zinchenko RA."], "ISO_journal" "J Invest Dermatol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Invest Dermatol", "title" "Autosomal Recessive Hypotrichosis with Woolly Hair Caused by a Mutation in the Keratin 25 Gene Expressed in Hair Follicles.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "1097-1105", "volume" "136", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26902920}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005198", "name" "structural molecule activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR002957", "name" "Keratin, type I", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
