{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI or TFPI1), also called lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) or extrinsic pathway inhibitor, is an anti-coagulation plasma protein that acts as a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. Though TFPI lacks a membrane attachment signal, it remains associated with the endothelial surface through its association with a GPI-anchored co-receptor, which acts as a molecular chaperone to move TFPI to the cell surface [[cite:PUB00033202]]. TFPI is a dual inhibitor, binding directly to factor Xa (FXa), and to tissue factor/factor VIIa (TF/FVIIa) in a FXa-dependent way, presumably by forming a quaternary FXa/TFPI/FVIIa/TF complex, thereby blocking the continuation of the coagulation pathway. TFPI is thought to be important in modulating tissue factor-induced thrombogenesis [[cite:PUB00033197]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The homologous tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI-2) has a similar structure and is thought to play a role in the regulation of extracellular matrix digestion and remodelling [[cite:PUB00033203]].
