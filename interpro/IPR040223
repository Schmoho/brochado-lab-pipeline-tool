{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>PAR basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factors constitute a group of circadian transcription factors that have conserved basic regions flanked by proline- and acidic-amino-aci-rich (PAR) domains and functionally compatible leucine zipper dimerization domains [[cite:PUB00090713]]. PARbZip proteins are transcriptionally controlled by the circadian molecular oscillator, and in turn control expression of transcription factors and enzymes involved in metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification [[cite:PUB00090716]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry includes vertebrates PARbZip proteins thyrotroph embryonic factor TEF/VBP, D site-binding protein (DBP), and hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), and Drosophila giant bZIP factor.
