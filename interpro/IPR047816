{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents proteins related to SCO1431 from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), which are small and extremely hydrophobic proteins that lack an N-terminal signal peptide.  Toward the C terminus they are predicted to contain a single transmembrane helix that is sufficient for localization, suggesting a targeting pathway that is independent of the SRP (signal recognition particle) [[cite:PUB00105133]]. Members of this family are restricted to the genus Streptomyces.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033485" "SCO1431 family membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Membrane protein SCO1431-like", "short" "SCO1431-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 187, "taxa" 704, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 659, "sets" 0, "proteins" 659, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 403}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047816", :literature {"PUB00105133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Craney A" "Tahlan K" "Andrews D" "Nodwell J."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Bacterial transmembrane proteins that lack N-terminal signal sequences.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e19421", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21573234}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047816", "name" "Membrane protein SCO1431-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
