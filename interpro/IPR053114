{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes histone-lysine N-methyltransferases that are responsible for the monomethylation of 'Lys-27' on histone H3 (H3K27me1). These enzymes exhibit a preference for nucleosomes containing the H3.1 variant over H3.3 [[cite:PUB00155251]]. They play a crucial role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin, contributing to the silencing of heterochromatic regions [[cite:PUB00149327], [cite:PUB00149328]]. Additionally, they are involved in the regulation of rRNA gene expression by influencing the expression or silencing of specific rRNA gene variants [[cite:PUB00149329]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5vac", "name" "Crystal Structure of ATXR5 SET domain in complex with K36me3 histone H3 peptide"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046341", "name" "SET domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR48458" "SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN", "PTHR48442" "SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase ATXR5/ATXR6", "short" "ATXR5/ATXR6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 266, "taxa" 1069, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1211, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1211, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 718}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
