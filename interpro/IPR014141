{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA repair is accomplished by several different systems in prokaryotes. Recombinational repair of double-stranded DNA breaks involves the RecBCD pathway in some lineages, and AddAB (also called RexAB) in other. The AddA is conserved between the firmicutes and the alphaproteobacteria, while its partner protein (RexB) is not. The partner may be designated AddB, as in Bacillus and in alphaproteobacteria, or RexB as in Streptococcus and Lactococcus. Note, however, that RexB proteins lack an N-terminal GxxGxGK[ST] ATP-binding motif found in Bacillus subtilis and related species, and this difference may be important. This entry represents RexB proteins as found in Streptococcus and Lactococcus.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02774" "ATP-dependent nuclease subunit B"}, "hamap" {"MF_01453" "ATP-dependent helicase/deoxyribonuclease subunit B [rexB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA helicase subunit RexB", "short" "DNA_helicase_suRexB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 145, "taxa" 863, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1290, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1290, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 958}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0493", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0493"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014141", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0016788", "name" "hydrolase activity, acting on ester bonds", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016817", "name" "hydrolase activity, acting on acid anhydrides", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014141", "name" "DNA helicase subunit RexB", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
