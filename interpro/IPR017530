{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The sequences in this family contain the pyridoxal binding domain and C-terminal sheet domain of a family of Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases. Characterised enzymes in this family decarboxylate substrates such as ornithine, diaminopimelate and arginine. \r\n\r\nThe proteins found in tyhis entry, with the exception of those observed in certain Burkholderia species, are all found in the context of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis loci containing the exosortase/PEP-CTERM protein sorting system [[cite:PUB00034422]]. More specifically, these are characteristic of the type 1 exosortase system represented by [genprop:GenProp0652]. The substrate of these enzymes may be a precursor of the carrier or linker which is hypothesized to release the PEP-CTERM protein from the exosortase enzyme. These enzymes are apparently most closely related to the diaminopimelate decarboxylase found in [interpro:IPR002986], which may suggest a similarity (or identity) of substrate.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029066", "name" "PLP-binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009006", "name" "Alanine racemase/group IV decarboxylase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03099" "pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase, exosortase A system-associated"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase, exosortase system type 1 associated", "short" "DCO2ase_PEP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 633, "taxa" 1929, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1625, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1625, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1310}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0652", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0652"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017530", :literature {"PUB00034422" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Haft DH" "Paulsen IT" "Ward N" "Selengut JD."], "ISO_journal" "BMC Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-4-29", "medline_journal" "BMC Biol", "title" "Exopolysaccharide-associated protein sorting in environmental organisms: the PEP-CTERM/EpsH system.
