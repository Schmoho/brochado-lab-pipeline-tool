{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Caseins are the major protein component of milk, functioning as nutritive carriers of both amino acids and minerals in milk. They are phosphoproteins that can be classified into two families, the kappa-casein family and the alpha-s1, alpha-s2 and beta-casein family, the later displaying considerable species variation [[cite:PUB00014749]]. This entry represents the alpha-s2 caseins, highly phosphorylated peptides that occur as different isoforms.
