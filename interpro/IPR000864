{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteinase inhibitors belong to MEROPS inhibitor family I13, clan IG.  They inhibit peptidases of the S1 ([interpro:IPR001254]) and S8 ([interpro:IPR000209]) families [[cite:PUB00014133]].  Potato inhibitor type I sequences are not solely restricted to potatoes but are found in other plant species for example: barley endosperm chymotrypsin inhibitor [[cite:PUB00001351]], and pumpkin trypsin inhibitor. Apart from leeches, e.g.Hirudo medicinalis (Medicinal leech), homologues are not found in metazoa [[cite:PUB00001150]]. In general, the proteins have retained a specificity towards chymotrypsin-like and elastase-like proteases. Structurally these inhibitors are small (60 to 90 residues) and in contrast with other families of protease inhibitors, they lack disulphide bonds. The inhibitor is a wedge-shaped molecule, its pointed edge formed by the protease-binding loop, which contains the scissile bond. The loop binds tightly to the protease active site, subsequent cleavage of the scissile bond causing inhibition of the enzyme [[cite:PUB00001150]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inhibitors (designated type I and II) are synthesised in potato tubers, increasing in concentration as the tuber develops. Synthesis of the inhibitors throughout the plant is also induced by leaf damage; this systemic response being triggered by the release of a putative plant hormone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples found in the bacteria and archaea are probable false positives.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7a3m", "name" "Synergistic stabilization of a double mutant in CI2 from an in-cell library screen"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036354", "name" "Proteinase inhibitor I13, potato inhibitor I superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33091" "PROTEIN, PUTATIVE, EXPRESSED-RELATED"}, "prosite" {"PS00285" "Potato inhibitor I family signature"}, "prints" {"PR00292" "POTATOINHBTR"}, "pfam" {"PF00280" "Potato inhibitor I family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Proteinase inhibitor I13, potato inhibitor I", "short" "Prot_inh_pot1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 88, "proteomes" 356, "taxa" 1829, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4959, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4808, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3258}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00257", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00257"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000864", :literature {"PUB00014133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 3", "authors" ["Rawlings ND" "Tolle DP" "Barrett AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
