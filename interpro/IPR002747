{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) hydroxide adenosyltransferase family groups several fluorinase and chlorinase enzymes whose common feature is that they mediate nucleophilic reactions of their respective halide ions to the C-5' carbon of SAM [[cite:PUB00054078]]. These enzymes utilise a rigorously conserved amino acid side chain triad (Asp-Arg-His) which may have a role in activating water to hydroxide ion. Structural studies indicate that the protein is a homotrimer, with each monomer being composed of N- and C-terminal domains [[cite:PUB00030772], [cite:PUB00048880], [cite:PUB00151506]]. The N-terminal domain has a central seven-stranded β-sheet, which combines parallel and antiparallel strands sandwiched between α-helices. The C-terminal domain forms a β-barrel with a greek-key topology. SAM is bound at the interface between the C-terminal domain of one monomer and the N-terminal domain of the neighbouring monomer, with a total of three molecules bound by the trimer. This group of proteins, which are predominantly found in prokaryotes, used to be known as DUF62 [[cite:PUB00101218]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wr8", "name" "Structure of Pyrococcus horikoshii SAM hydroxide adenosyltransferase in complex with SAH"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023227", "name" "S-adenosyl-l-methionine hydroxide adenosyltransferase, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023228", "name" "S-adenosyl-l-methionine hydroxide adenosyltransferase, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35092" "CHLORINASE MJ1651"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006779" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP006779 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "S-adenosyl-l-methionine hydroxide adenosyltransferase", "short" "SAM_OH_AdoTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 32, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2212, "taxa" 10418, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13306, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13165, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 10126}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
