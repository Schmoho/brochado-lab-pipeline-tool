{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The structural and functional relationships among independently cloned segments of the plasmid ColE1 region that regulates and codes for colicin E1 (cea), immunity (imm) and the mitomycin C-induced lethality function (lys) have been analysed [[cite:PUB00006233]]. A model for the structure and expression of the colicin E1 operon has been proposed in which the cea and lys genes are expressed from a single inducible promoter that is controlled by the lexA repressor in response to the SOS system of Escherichia coli [[cite:PUB00006233]]. The imm gene lies between the cea and lys genes and is expressed by transcription in the opposite direction from a promoter located within the lys gene [[cite:PUB00006233]]. This arrangement indicates that the transcriptional units for all three genes overlap. It is proposed that the formation of anti-sense RNA may be an important element in the coordinate regulation of gene expression in this system [[cite:PUB00006233]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03526" "Colicin E1 (microcin) immunity protein"}, "prints" {"PR01298" "MICROCIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Colicin E1 (microcin) immunity protein", "short" "Microcin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 264, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 479, "sets" 0, "proteins" 355, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 305}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003061", :literature {"PUB00006233" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Waleh NS" "Johnson PH."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
