Mate attraction in Aplysia involves a long-distance water-borne signal in the form of the attractin peptide that is released during egg laying.

The second helix contains the IEECKTS sequence conserved in Aplysia attractins [[cite:PUB00016447]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036585", "name" "Attractin superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08037" "Attractin family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Attractin", "short" "Attractin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 24, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012529", :literature {"PUB00016447" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Painter SD" "Cummins SF" "Nichols AE" "Akalal DB" "Schein CH" "Braun W" "Smith JS" "Susswein AJ" "Levy M" "de Boer PA" "ter Maat A" "Miller MW" "Scanlan C" "Milberg RM" "Sweedler JV" "Nagle GT."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
