{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interleukins (IL) are a group of cytokines that play an important role in the immune system.

The IL-17 family (of which there are 6 known members, termed IL-17A to IL-17F) is thought to represent a distinct signalling system that appears to have been highly conserved across vertebrate evolution [[cite:PUB00012254]].
