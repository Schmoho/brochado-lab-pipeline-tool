{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes protein GL2-INTERACTING REPRESSOR 1/2 (GIR1/2) and their paralogue, protein salt-induced and EIN3/EIL1-dependent 1 (SIED1), which regulators of plant development and stress responses. GIR1/2 are involved in the modulation of root hair development and act as negative regulators in this process. They may function as adapter proteins, interacting with other proteins to control gene expression related to root hair formation [[cite:PUB00155291], [cite:PUB00155292]]. SIED1 is implicated in ethylene-dependent salt stress responses, where they play a role in reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting the plant from oxidative damage [[cite:PUB00155290]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR33177" "PUTATIVE-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GIR1-2/SIED1", "short" "GIR1-2/SIED1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 239, "taxa" 899, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2729, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2729, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1633}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055281", :literature {"PUB00155291" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Wu R" "Citovsky V."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.05.084", "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "Adaptor proteins GIR1 and GIR2.
