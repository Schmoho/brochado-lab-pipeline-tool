Critical roles of the PATE (Pate)-like proteins in activities related not only to fertility and reproduction but also to neuronal activity. Neurons and sperm share many common \"neuron specific\" receptors. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHR) subunits alpha7, 9, 3, 5 and beta 4 have all been demonstrated to be present in human sperm and the alpha-7 subunit likely exists as a homomer in the posterior post-acrosomal and neck regions of sperm. Human acrosome reaction initiated by acetylcholine involves the alpha-7 nAChR [[cite:PUB00093810]]. Common functionality of nAChR in both reproductive and neuronal tissues thus reconciles the neuro-modulatory activity of the PATE (Pate)-like proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47884" "PROSTATE AND TESTIS EXPRESSED PROTEIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Prostate and testis expressed protein 2", "short" "PATE2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 115, "taxa" 412, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 201, "sets" 0, "proteins" 201, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 125}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029691", :literature {"PUB00070651" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Levitin F" "Weiss M" "Hahn Y" "Stern O" "Papke RL" "Matusik R" "Nandana SR" "Ziv R" "Pichinuk E" "Salame S" "Bera T" "Vincent J" "Lee B" "Pastan I" "Wreschner DH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
