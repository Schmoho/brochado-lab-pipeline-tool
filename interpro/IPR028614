{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GDP-L-fucose synthase is responsible for the last step of the major metabolic pathway resulting in GDP-L-fucose synthesis from GDP-D-mannose. It catalyses a combined epimerase and NADPH-dependent reductase reaction, converting GDP-4-keto-6-D-deoxymannose to GDP-L-fucose [[cite:PUB00068854]]. Since several cell-surface antigens, including the leukocyte Lewis system and cell-surface antigens in pathogenic bacteria, depend on the availability of GDP-L-fucose for their expression, the enzyme is a potential target for therapy in pathological states depending on selectin-mediated cell-to-cell interactions [[cite:PUB00024463]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry also includes ColC from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. ColC is a GDP-L-colitose synthase, which is a bifunctional enzyme catalysaing the C-5 epimerization of GDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxy-D-mannose and the subsequent C-4 keto reduction of the resulting L-epimer to give GDP-L-colitose [[cite:PUB00078586]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7anc", "name" "MlghC, GDP-mannoheptose C4 reductase from Campylobacter jejuni with NADP bound"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05239" "GDP-fucose synthetase, extended (e) SDRs"}, "hamap" {"MF_00956" "GDP-L-fucose synthase [fcl]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GDP-L-fucose synthase/GDP-L-colitose synthase", "short" "GDP_fucose/colitose_synth"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4625, "taxa" 20288, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19568, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19565, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14676}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
