{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents tRNA (guanine-N-7) methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.33]), which catalyses the formation of N(7)-methylguanine at position 46 (m7G46) in tRNA. Capping of the pre-mRNA 5' end by addition a monomethylated guanosine cap (m(7)G) is an essential and the earliest modification in the biogenesis of mRNA [[cite:PUB00044795]]. The reaction is catalysed by three enzymes: triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and tRNA (guanine-N-7) methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00017356], [cite:PUB00043301]].

They transfer a methyl group most frequently from S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) to a nucleophilic acceptor such as oxygen leading to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and a methylated molecule [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]]. All these enzymes have in common a conserved region of about 130 amino acid residues that allow them to bind SAM [[cite:PUB00006319]]. The substrates that are methylated by these enzymes cover virtually every kind of biomolecules ranging from small molecules, to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00006319]]. Methyltransferase are therefore involved in many essential cellular processes including biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein repair, chromatin regulation and gene silencing [[cite:PUB00057957], [cite:PUB00057958], [cite:PUB00054125]].
