The maternally expressed Pat1a protein acts as a translational repressor, while Pat1b functions in mRNA decay in somatic cells. Pat1b is localised to P-body and is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that may perform various nuclear functions upstream of their multiple posttranscriptional regulatory roles in the cytoplasm [[cite:PUB00090283]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5lmg", "name" "Structure of C-terminal domain from S. cerevisiae Pat1 decapping activator bound to Dcp2 HLM10 peptide (region 954-970)"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR21551" "TOPOISOMERASE II-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PAT1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pat1-like", "short" "Pat1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2453, "taxa" 8249, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6259, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6259, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3948}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039900", :literature {"PUB00090283" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Marnef A" "Weil D" "Standart N."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
