{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents type II secretion system protein H (GspH) found predominantly in gammaproteobacteria. The proteins of the type II secretion system (T2SS) are named Gsp in general and Eps in V. cholerae. EpsH is a GspH homologue and one of the minor pseudopilin components of the T2SS. This protein has been structurally characterised [[cite:PUB00049160], [cite:PUB00094008]]. It adopts an α/β structure, in which a hydrophobic helix is cradled by a pair of four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The type II secretion system (T2SS) is one of several extracellular secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria. It delivers toxins and a range of hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-active enzymes to the cell surface or extracellular space [[cite:PUB00093998]]. T2SS systems are composed of 11 to 15 different proteins, which are generally called GspA to GspO and GspS. The T2SS spans the two bacterial membranes and ensures secretion of folded proteins across the outer membrane pore formed by GspD. The inner membrane complex contains GspC, GspL, GspM, and GspF. The cytoplasmic domains of GspL and GspF interact with an ATPase, GspE. GspE is thought to energize the formation of a short pseudopilus by several pilin-like proteins, GspG to GspK [[cite:PUB00094004]]. GspD has been shown to interact with the inner membrane component GspC [[cite:PUB00051842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01708" "type II secretion system minor pseudopilin GspH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II secretion system minor pseudopilin GspH", "short" "TypeII_GspH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 480, "taxa" 2707, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3075, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3075, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2316}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049875", :literature {"PUB00051842" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Korotkov KV" "Pardon E" "Steyaert J" "Hol WG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2008.11.011", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the secretin GspD from ETEC determined with the assistance of a nanobody.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "255-65", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19217396}, "PUB00093998" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Korotkov KV" "Sandkvist M."], "ISO_journal" "EcoSal Plus", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "EcoSal Plus", "title" "Architecture, Function, and Substrates of the Type II Secretion System.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 30767847}, "PUB00094004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Wang X" "Pineau C" "Gu S" "Guschinskaya N" "Pickersgill RW" "Shevchik VE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
