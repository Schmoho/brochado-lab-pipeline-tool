{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents coat proteins found in several satellite viruses, including satellite panicum mosaic virus [[cite:PUB00020147]], satellite tobacco necrosis virus, and satellite St. Augustine decline virus. The coat proteins of satellite viruses consist of a Î²-sandwich jelly-roll fold, with usually eight strands making up the two sheets, although some members can have an extra 1-2 strands. The characteristic interaction between the domains of this fold allows the formation of five-fold and pseudo six-fold assemblies. Although the satellite virus coat proteins share the same jelly-roll fold, they differ in the arrangement of their secondary structural elements and in the interactions of adjacent subunits [[cite:PUB00007874]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4v4m", "name" "1.45 Angstrom Structure of STNV coat protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037164", "name" "Satellite virus coat domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF03898" "Satellite tobacco necrosis virus coat protein", "PF06184" "Potexvirus coat protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Satellite virus coat", "short" "Satellite_virus_coat"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 131, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 283, "sets" 0, "proteins" 283, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010392", :literature {"PUB00020147" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Ban N" "McPherson A."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
