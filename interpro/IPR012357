{:metadata {:description [{"text" "This is a small family of archaeal proteins. Their genes are located in an operon containing two genes of box C/D RNA protein complexes. These proteins adopt α/β structure consisting of two subdomains. The N-terminal subdomain contains a HTH motif whereas the C-terminal subdomain shows a partial structural similarity to several nucleic acid binding proteins such as tRNA intron endonucleases , DNA mismatch repair protein MutS, etc. [[cite:PUB00098020]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF024484" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP024484 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP024484", "short" "UCP024484"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 52, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 27}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012357", :literature {"PUB00098020" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhou T" "Yao X" "Wang J" "Feng Y."], "ISO_journal" "J Struct Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Struct Biol", "title" "Solution structure of an archaeal DUF61 family protein SSO0941 encoded by a gene in the operon of box C/D RNA protein complexes.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "179-184", "volume" "203", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29526782}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR012357", "name" "Uncharacterised conserved protein UCP024484", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
