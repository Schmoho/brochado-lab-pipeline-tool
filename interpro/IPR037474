{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ScaA/Sca1 is a component of the Sca1 complex, a regulator of cell motility, chemotaxis and signal relay (cAMP production) in Dictyostelium. The Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex controls the RasC-TORC2-PKB/PKBR1 pathway at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. The Sca1 complex is recruited to the plasma membrane upon chemoattractant stimulation. ScaA acts as a molecular scaffold, bringing together GEFA, GEFH and PHR with PP2A [[cite:PUB00087010]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37516" "SCA1 COMPLEX SCAFFOLD PROTEIN SCAA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sca1 complex scaffold protein ScaA", "short" "ScaA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 91, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 162, "sets" 0, "proteins" 162, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 45}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR037474", :literature {"PUB00087010" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Charest PG" "Shen Z" "Lakoduk A" "Sasaki AT" "Briggs SP" "Firtel RA."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
