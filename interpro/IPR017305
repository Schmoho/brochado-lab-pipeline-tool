Extensive tyrosine phosphorylation occurs during integrin-mediated cell adhesion, embryonic development, fibroblast transformation and following stimulation of cells by mitogens that operate through the 7TM family of G-protein-coupled receptors [[cite:PUB00003091]]. Paxillin binds in vitro to the focal adhesion protein vinculin, as well as to the SH3 domain of c-Src, and, when tyrosine phosphorylated, to the SH2 domain of v-Crk [[cite:PUB00003091]]. An N-terminal region has been identified that supports the binding of both vinculin and the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, pp125Fak [[cite:PUB00003091]].</p>\r\n<p>Paxillin is a 68kDa protein containing multiple domains, including four tandem C-terminal LIM domains (each of which binds 2 zinc ions); an N-terminal proline-rich domain, which contains a consensus SH3 binding site; and three potential Crk-SH2 binding sites [[cite:PUB00002943]]. The predicted structure of paxillin suggests that it is a unique cytoskeletal protein capable of interaction with a variety of intracellular signalling and structural molecules important in growth control and the regulation of cytoskeletal organisation [[cite:PUB00002943], [cite:PUB00003091]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037881" "Leupaxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Leupaxin/Paxillin/TGFB1I1", "short" "Tgfb1i1/Leupaxin/TGFB1I1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 479, "taxa" 1869, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1385, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1333, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 910}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017305", :literature {"PUB00003091" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Turner CE" "Miller JT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
