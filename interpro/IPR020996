{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacterial effector protein AvrPto, from Pseudomonas syringae and in particular the central core region of the protein that consists of a three-helix bundle motif. AvrPto is part of a type III secretion system from P.syringae which is involved in the bacterial speck disease of tomato. In resistant plants, AvrPto interacts with the host Pto kinase, which elicits an antibacterial defence response. In plants lacking resistance, the Pto kinase is not present and AvrPto acts as a virulence factor, promoting bacterial growth [[cite:PUB00030532]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036532", "name" "AvrPto superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11592" "Central core of the bacterial effector protein AvrPto"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type III secretion system, AvrPto", "short" "T3SS_AvrPto"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 1, "taxa" 57, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 50, "sets" 0, "proteins" 50, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 38}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020996", :literature {"PUB00030532" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Wulf J" "Pascuzzi PE" "Fahmy A" "Martin GB" "Nicholson LK."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2004.04.017", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The solution structure of type III effector protein AvrPto reveals conformational and dynamic features important for plant pathogenesis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "1257-68", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15242602}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020996", "name" "Type III secretion system, AvrPto", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 1, "alignment:full" 1}}}
