{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Lon protease is an ATP-dependent serine proteases that mediates the selective degradation of misfolded, unassembled or oxidatively damaged polypeptides as well as certain short-lived regulatory proteins [[cite:PUB00062807]]. Proteins in this entry are the eukaryotic homologues of the Lon protease that localise at the mitochondrial matrix. They may also have a chaperone function in the assembly of inner membrane protein complexes. They may participate in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and in the maintenance of the integrity of the mitochondrial genome [[cite:PUB00064768]]. In plants, they also localise at the chloroplast [[cite:PUB00064774]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03120" "Lon protease homolog, mitochondrial [LONP1]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lon protease homologue, chloroplastic/mitochondrial", "short" "Lonm_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2128, "taxa" 7147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3913, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3913, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2375}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
