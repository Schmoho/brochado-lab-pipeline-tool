{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the biotin carboxylase subunit found usually as a component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase ([ec:6.4.1.2]) is a heterohexamer of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase ([ec:6.3.4.14]), and two subunits of carboxyl transferase in a 2:2 complex. In the first step of long-chain fatty acid synthesis, biotin carboxylase catalyses the carboxylation of the carrier protein and then the transcarboxylase transfers the carboxyl group to form malonyl-coA. Homologous domains are found in eukaryotic forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in a number of other carboxylases (e.g. pyruvate carboxylase). In some systems, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein and this protein (biotin carboxylase) may be shared by different carboxyltransferases. However, this model is not intended to identify the biotin carboxylase domain of propionyl-coA carboxylase. The model should hit the full length of proteins, except for chloroplast transit peptides in plants. If it hits a domain only of a longer protein, there may be a problem with the identification.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3g8d", "name" "Crystal structure of the biotin carboxylase subunit, E296A mutant, of acetyl-COA carboxylase from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00514" "acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxylase subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, biotin carboxylase", "short" "Acetyl_CoA_COase_biotin_COase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 49, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6517, "taxa" 26028, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31834, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31834, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 24482}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0214", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0214"} {"accession" "GenProp1111", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1111"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
