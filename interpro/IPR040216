{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>T cell-dependent immune processes require cell-surface interactions that mediate the initiation, modulation and the ultimate course of the response. The specificity of T cell recognition is determined by the engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) on T cells with cognate peptide-MHC complexes presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Additional signals are required to sustain and enhance T cell activity, the most important of which is provided by the engagement of CD28 on T cells with its ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). By contrast, the interaction of B7 isoforms with cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 CTLA-4, a CD28 homologue receptor on T cells (31% identity), provides inhibitory signals required for down-regulation of the response, while it may also prevent T cell activation by weak TCR signals [[cite:PUB00010260], [cite:PUB00010330], [cite:PUB00010376], [cite:PUB00010415], [cite:PUB00010408]].</p>\n\n<p>Sequence comparison between human CTLA-4 and CD28 proteins suggests they are homologous, with the highest of degree of similarity being in the juxta- membrane and cytoplasmic regions. In addition, the cytoplasmic domains of human and murine CTLA-4 are identical, suggesting that this region has important functional properties [[cite:PUB00010260]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5e56", "name" "Crystal structure of mouse CTLA-4"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11494" "CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTE PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4/CD28", "short" "CTLA4/CD28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 630, "taxa" 2117, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1833, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1833, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1281}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040216", :literature {"PUB00010260" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Linsley PS" "Brady W" "Urnes M" "Grosmaire LS" "Damle NK" "Ledbetter JA."], "ISO_journal" "J.
