{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferases (GGCTs) are ubiquitous enzymes found in bacteria, plants, and metazoans. This family includes AIG2 proteins from Arabidopsis, which exhibit RPS2- and avrRpt2-dependent induction early after infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola strain ES4326 carrying avrRpt2 [[cite:PUB00007984]]. Its structure consists of a five-stranded β-barrel surrounded by two α-helices and a small β-sheet. A long flexible α-helix protrudes from the structure at the C-terminal end. Conserved residues in a hydrophilic cavity, which are able to bind small ligands, may act as an active site in AIG2-like proteins [[cite:PUB00040892]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036568", "name" "Gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31544" "AIG2-LIKE PROTEIN D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein AIG2-like", "short" "AIG2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1658, "taxa" 5739, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5125, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5125, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3353}, "pathways" 10}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
