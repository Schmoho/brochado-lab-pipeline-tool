{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this entry include YlbJ, from Bacillus subtilis. They are found exclusively in the Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive bacteria) and are known from studies in B. subtilis to be part of the sigma-E regulon [[cite:PUB00012907]]. Mutation leads to a sporulation defect, confirming that members of this entry are involved in sporulation. The protein appears to be universal among endospore-forming bacteria, and in Symbiobacterium thermophilum IAM 14863, there are two ORFs encoding YlbJ that are distant from each other.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02871" "sporulation integral membrane protein YlbJ"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation integral membrane protein YlbJ", "short" "Spore_IM_YlbJ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 711, "taxa" 2112, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2007, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2007, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1503}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014226", :literature {"PUB00012907" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Eichenberger P" "Jensen ST" "Conlon EM" "van Ooij C" "Silvaggi J" "Gonzalez-Pastor JE" "Fujita M" "Ben-Yehuda S" "Stragier P" "Liu JS" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
