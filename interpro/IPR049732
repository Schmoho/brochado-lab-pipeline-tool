{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes Smlt3025 ([swissprot:B2FJJ6]), an immunity protein of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) found in the multi-drug-resistant opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Experiments show that Smlt3025 counteracts Smlt3024, an effector protein transferred by the T4SS into target cells. The crystal structure of Smlt3025 reveals a topology similar to the iron-regulated protein FrpD from Neisseria meningitidis which has been shown to interact with the RTX protein FrpC, while its counterpart Smlt3024 is homologous to the N-terminal domain of large Ca2-binding RTX proteins [[cite:PUB00145713]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6pdk", "name" "The Structure of Smlt3025, an immunity protein of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia type IV secretion system"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd20897" "S. maltophilia immunity protein with unknown function (Smlt3025) and similar proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Smlt3025-like", "short" "Smlt3025-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 350, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 401, "sets" 0, "proteins" 401, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049732", :literature {"PUB00145713" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Bayer-Santos E" "Cenens W" "Matsuyama BY" "Oka GU" "Di Sessa G" "Mininel IDV" "Alves TL" "Farah CS."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "The opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia utilizes a type IV secretion system for interbacterial killing.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "e1007651", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31513674}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049732", "name" "Smlt3025-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
