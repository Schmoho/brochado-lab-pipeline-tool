{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes serine proteases such as L. pneumophila effector Lpg1137 [[cite:PUB00091390]].  Lpg1137, is a serine protease that targets the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) and degrades STX17 (syntaxin 17), a SNARE implicated in macroautophagy/autophagy as well as mitochondria dynamics and membrane trafficking in fed cells. Lpg1137 has a sequence (-Gly-Leu-Ser68-Gly-Gly-) that matches the consensus sequence for the active site of serine proteases (Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly/Ala, where X is any residue). It exhibits proteolytic activity toward STX17 in vitro, whereas an active site mutant in which Ser68 is replaced by Ala does not. Expressed Lpg1137 localizes to the MAM and mitochondria, in addition to the cytosol, and binds to STX17 [[cite:PUB00091391]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF18405" "Mitochondrial SLC25 homolog"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gammaproteobacterial serine protease", "short" "Serine_protease"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 63, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 68, "sets" 0, "proteins" 67, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 59}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
