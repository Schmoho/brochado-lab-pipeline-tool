{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a protein family which is homologous to the HlyD membrane fusion protein of type I secretion systems. The genes encoding these proteins within prokaryotic genomes are associated with genes encoding a novel class of microcin (small bacteriocin) which has a propeptide region related to nitrile hydratase. The bacteriocin has been designated as Nitrile Hydratase Propeptide Microcin, or NHPM. On this basis, therefore, proteins in this entry are designated as NHPM bacteriocin system secretion proteins. Some, but not all, NHPM-class putative microcins belong to the TOMM (thiazole/oxazole modified microcin) class as assessed by the presence of the scaffolding protein and/or cyclodehydratase in the same gene clusters.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03794" "NHLP bacteriocin system secretion protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NHPM bacteriocin system secretion protein, HylD", "short" "NHPM_bacteriocin_SS_HylD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 231, "taxa" 1579, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1062, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1060, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 820}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0861", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0861"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022275", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022275", "name" "NHPM bacteriocin system secretion protein, HylD", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
