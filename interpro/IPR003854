{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is the GASA gibberellin regulated cysteine rich protein (GRPs) family. The expression of these proteins is up-regulated by the plant hormone gibberellin, most of these proteins have a role in plant development and some of its members have antimicrobial activity [[cite:PUB00096617], [cite:PUB00096618]]. There are 12 cysteine residues conserved within the alignment giving the potential for these proteins to possess 6 disulphide bonds.</p>\n\n<p>Included in this family are some GRPs found in fruits and pollens that have been identified as allergens, including peach Pru p 7, Japanese apricot Pru m 7, orange Cit s 7, pomegranate Pun g 7, and cypress pollen GRP [[cite:PUB00096617], [cite:PUB00096615], [cite:PUB00096616]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5e5y", "name" "Quasi-racemic snakin-1 in P1 before radiation damage"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02704" "Gibberellin regulated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Gibberellin regulated protein", "short" "GASA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 64, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 1028, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5600, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5581, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3392}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003854", :literature {"PUB00096618" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Berrocal-Lobo M" "Segura A" "Moreno M" "Lopez G" "Garcia-Olmedo F" "Molina A."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "Snakin-2, an antimicrobial peptide from potato whose gene is locally induced by wounding and responds to pathogen infection.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "951-61", "volume" "128", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11891250}, "PUB00096617" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Inomata N."], "ISO_journal" "Allergol Int", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Allergol Int", "title" "Gibberellin-regulated protein allergy: Clinical features and cross-reactivity.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "11-18", "volume" "69", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31784246}, "PUB00096615" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Ehrenberg AE" "Klingebiel C" "Ostling J" "Larsson H" "Mattsson L" "Vitte J" "Lidholm J."], "ISO_journal" "Clin Exp Allergy", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Clin Exp Allergy", "title" "Characterization of a 7 kDa pollen allergen belonging to the gibberellin-regulated protein family from three Cupressaceae species.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "964-972", "volume" "50", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32506709}, "PUB00096616" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tuppo L" "Alessandri C" "Pomponi D" "Picone D" "Tamburrini M" "Ferrara R" "Petriccione M" "Mangone I" "Palazzo P" "Liso M" "Giangrieco I" "Crescenzo R" "Bernardi ML" "Zennaro D" "Helmer-Citterich M" "Mari A" "Ciardiello MA."], "ISO_journal" "Clin Exp Allergy", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Clin Exp Allergy", "title" "Peamaclein--a new peach allergenic protein: similarities, differences and misleading features compared to Pru p 3.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "128-40", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23278887}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR003854", "name" "Gibberellin regulated protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 73, "alignment:full" 3129}}}
