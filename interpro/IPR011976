{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of probable oligoendopeptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family M3, subfamily M3B (clan MA(E)). The family is related to lactococcal PepF and group B streptococcal PepB ([interpro:IPR004438]) but in a distinct clade with considerable sequence differences not only to [interpro:IPR004438] but also to [interpro:IPR011977].  Likely substrates are small peptides and not whole proteins, as with PepF, but members are not characterised and the activity profile may differ. Several bacteria have both a member of this family and a member of the PepF family.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ahn", "name" "PZ PEPTIDASE A with Inhibitor 1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02289" "M3 family oligoendopeptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase M3B, oligoendopeptidase-related", "short" "Pept_M3B_oligopep-rel"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1138, "taxa" 4263, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5208, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5208, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3679}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011976", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045090", "name" "Peptidase M3A/M3B", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR004438", "name" "Peptidase M3B, oligoendopeptidase F", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR034009", "name" "Oligopeptidase F type 4", "type" "Family", "children" []}]} {"accession" "IPR011976", "name" "Peptidase M3B, oligoendopeptidase-related", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011977", "name" "Peptidase M3B, oligoendopeptidase-related clade 3", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR034006", "name" "Oligopeptidase F type 2", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
