{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Birt-Hogg-Dube' syndrome, a disorder characterised by benign tumours of the hair follicle, lung cysts and renal neoplasia, is caused by germline mutations in the BHD(FLCN) gene; this encodes a tumour suppressor protein, folliculin (FLCN), of unknown function [[cite:PUB00060267]]. The folliculin- interacting protein, FNIP1, has also been identified and shown to interact with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a vital role in energy sensing [[cite:PUB00060267]]. Together, then, it is thought that folliculin (mutated in Birt-Hogg-Dube' syndrome) and its interaction partner, FNIP1, may be involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing via the AMPK and mTOR signalling pathways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FNIP1 has a homologue, FNIP2, which also interacts with FLCN and AMPK. C-terminally-deleted FLCN mutants, like those produced by germline mutations in BHD patients, do not bind FNIP2, suggesting that FLCN tumour-suppressor function may be facilitated by interactions with both FNIP1 and FNIP2 via its C terminus [[cite:PUB00060268]]. FNIP1 and FNIP2 are able to form homo- or heteromeric multimers, and may hence function either independently or cooperatively with FLCN [[cite:PUB00060268]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry represents the FNIP family, including FNIP1 and FNIP2.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02073" "Folliculin-interacting protein 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Folliculin-interacting protein family", "short" "FNIP_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 843, "taxa" 3066, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12904, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2873, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1757}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026156", :literature {"PUB00060267" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Brown PR" "Miki K" "Harper DB" "Eddy EM."], "ISO_journal" "Biol.
