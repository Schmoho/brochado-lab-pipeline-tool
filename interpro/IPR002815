{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Spo11, a meiotic recombination protein found in eukaryotes, and subunit A of topoisomerase VI, a type IIB topoisomerase found predominantly in archaea [[cite:PUB00007202], [cite:PUB00020804], [cite:PUB00083725], [cite:PUB00075470]]. These two types of proteins share structural homology.</p>\n\n<p>DNA topoisomerases regulate the number of topological links between two DNA strands (i.e. change the number of superhelical turns) by catalysing transient single- or double-strand breaks, crossing the strands through one another, then resealing the breaks. They can be divided into two classes: type I enzymes ([ec:5.6.2.1], topoisomerases I, III and V) break single-strand DNA, and type II enzymes ([ec:5.6.2.2], topoisomerases II, IV and VI) break double-strand DNA [[cite:PUB00020793]]. Topoisomerase VI is a type IIB enzymes that assembles as a heterotetramer, consisting of two A subunits required for DNA cleavage and two B subunits required for ATP hydrolysis. The B subunit is structurally similar to the ATPase domain of type IIA topoisomerases, but the A subunit is distinct, and instead shares homology with the Spo11 protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1d3y", "name" "STRUCTURE OF THE DNA TOPOISOMERASE VI A SUBUNIT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036078", "name" "Spo11/DNA topoisomerase VI subunit A superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01550" "TOP6AFAMILY"}, "panther" {"PTHR10848" "MEIOTIC RECOMBINATION PROTEIN SPO11"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Spo11/DNA topoisomerase VI subunit A", "short" "Spo11/TopoVI_A"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2848, "taxa" 11359, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10817, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10024, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7211}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
