{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RAD52 motif-containing protein 1 (RDM1) is involved in DNA damage repair pathway and the cell response to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin [[cite:PUB00090717], [cite:PUB00082860]]. RDM1 contains a small RD motif that is shared with the recombination and repair protein RAD52, and an RNA recognition motif (RRM). The RD motif is responsible for the acidic pH-dependent DNA-binding properties of RDM1. It interacts with ss- and dsDNA, and may act as a DNA-damage recognition factor by recognizing the distortions of the double helix caused by cisplatin-DNA adducts in vitro. In addition, due to the presence of RRM, RDM1 can bind to RNA as well as DNA [[cite:PUB00082861]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR31164" "RAD52 MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RAD52 motif-containing protein 1", "short" "RDM1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 475, "taxa" 1913, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 970, "sets" 0, "proteins" 970, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 610}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040224", :literature {"PUB00082861" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hamimes S" "Bourgeon D" "Stasiak AZ" "Stasiak A" "Van Dyck E."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
