{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The 34kDa protein encoded by the I3 gene of vaccinia virus, named Protein OPG079, is expressed at early and intermediate times post-infection and is phosphorylated on serine residues. I3 protein demonstrates a striking affinity for single-stranded, but not for double-stranded, DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that numerous I3 molecules can bind to a template, reflecting the stoichiometric interaction of I3 with DNA. Sequence analysis reveals that a pattern of aromatic and charged amino acids common to many replicative single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) is conserved in I3 [[cite:PUB00007993]]. This protein plays an essential role in viral DNA replication [[cite:PUB00103586]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04661" "Poxvirus I3 ssDNA-binding protein"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF003767" "ssDNA-binding protein, vaccinia I3L type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus I3 ssDNA-binding", "short" "Poxvirus_I3_ssDNA-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 32, "taxa" 148, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 194, "sets" 0, "proteins" 194, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006754", :literature {"PUB00007993" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Rochester SC" "Traktman P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
