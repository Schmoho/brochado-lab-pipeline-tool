{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14 (UBP14) and its homologues, such as Ubp2/6 from fungi and Ubp6/7 from Arabidopsis. They are ubiquitin-specific proteases responsible for disassembling ubiquitin chains at the proteasome, cleaving ubiquitin precursors, and editing ubiquitin side chains [[cite:PUB00096582]]. It has been shown that an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of USP14 associates with the base of the 26S proteasome and the interaction of USP14 with the proteasome activates the catalytic activity of USP14 [[cite:PUB00096582], [cite:PUB00039452]]. It has also be shown that Ubp6 has both deubiquitinating activity and proteasome-inhibitory activity [[cite:PUB00096584]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6iik", "name" "USP14 catalytic domain with IU1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038765", "name" "Papain-like cysteine peptidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR43982" "UBIQUITIN CARBOXYL-TERMINAL HYDROLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14-like", "short" "UBP14-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 28, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2665, "taxa" 9108, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8327, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8327, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4874}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
