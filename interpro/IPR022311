{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents DNA polymerase/3'-5' exonuclease PolX from Bacillus subtilis and similar proteins from bacteria and archaea. PolX is a strictly DNA-template-directed DNA polymerase, preferentially acting on DNA structures containing gaps from one to a few nucleotides and bearing a phosphate group at the 5' end of the downstream DNA. This enzyme has 3'-5' exonuclease activity, and edits unpaired 3'-termini in a gapped DNA substrate. It is also likely involved in resecting unannealed 3'-termini during DNA repair. The same PolX molecule could perform the subsequent gap-filling step [[cite:PUB00100853], [cite:PUB00100852]]. Members of this family have DNA polymerase X (POLIIIAc) and PHP hydrolase domains.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3b0x", "name" "K263A mutant of PolX from Thermus thermophilus HB8 complexed with Ca-dGTP"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005047" "Uncharacterised protein with DNA polymerase family X (POLIIIAc) and PHP domains"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase/3'-5' exonuclease PolX-like", "short" "PolX-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1841, "taxa" 8477, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10120, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9616, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7373}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
