{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>IreB is a cytosolic 10.5kDa protein that is highly conserved among low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Studies of E. faecalis mutants lacking ireB revealed that IreB acts downstream of IreK as a negative regulator of cephalosporin resistance in E. faecalis. IreB can be modified by phosphorylation in vivo, and mutations that prevent modification at the known sites of phosphorylation (T4 and T7) influence the ability of IreB to modulate cephalosporin resistance. Furthermore, mutations that impair dimerization abolish the regulation of cephalosporin resistance [[cite:PUB00091063]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7y8z", "name" "CcpS"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06135" "IreB regulatory phosphoprotein"}, "panther" {"PTHR40067" "UPF0297 PROTEIN YRZL"}, "hamap" {"MF_01507" "UPF0297 protein <locus_tag>"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF037258" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP037258 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "IreB regulatory phosphoprotein", "short" "IreB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 1718, "taxa" 6125, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5778, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5777, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4434}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009309", :literature {"PUB00091063" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Hall CL" "Lytle BL" "Jensen D" "Hoff JS" "Peterson FC" "Volkman BF" "Kristich CJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
