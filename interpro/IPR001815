{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>ORF2 of the capilloviruses (trichoviruses) contain a serine peptidase signature which belongs to the MEROPS peptidase family S35 (clan PA(S)). In a number of capilloviruses that have been sequenced to date ORF2 has been identified as the putative movement protein, though it also contains the consensus sequence Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly common to the active site of a number of serine proteases [[cite:PUB00005590]]. This family also contains proteins classified as non-peptidase homologues which have either been found experimentally to be without peptidase activity, or lack amino acid residues that are believed to be essential for the catalytic activity of peptidases in the family. Capilloviruses infect a number of different plant species, and can be detected by the presence of virions in leaf sap.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00995" "CAPILLOPTASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trichovirus movement protein", "short" "Trichovirus_mp"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 81, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3358, "sets" 0, "proteins" 744, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
