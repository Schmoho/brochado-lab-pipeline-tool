Metylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase Na+ pump is a representative of a class of Na transport decarboxylases that couples the energy derived by decarboxylation of carboxylic acid substrates to drive the extrusion of Na+ ion across the membrane, thereby creating a sodium ion motive force that is used for ATP synthesis [[cite:PUB00016214]]. This subunit may catalyse the Na-independent carboxyl transfer from methylmalonyl-CoA to the prosthetic biotin group located on the gamma subunit.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029045", "name" "ClpP/crotonase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01117" "methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase subunit alpha"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, alpha subunit", "short" "MemalonylCoA_decase_suA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 56, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 24, "sets" 0, "proteins" 24, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
