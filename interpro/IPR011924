{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents LolD, a member of the ABC transporter family. LolD is involved in localization of lipoproteins in some bacteria. It works with a transmembrane protein LolC, which in some species is a paralogous pair LolC and LolE. Depending on the residue immediately following the modified N-terminal Cys residue, the nascent lipoprotein may be carried further by LolA and LolB to the outer membrane, or remain at the inner membrane [[cite:PUB00015507]]. The LolCDE complex differs mechanistically from all other ABC transporters as it is not involved in the transmembrane transport of substrates [[cite:PUB00072505]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02211" "lipoprotein-releasing ABC transporter ATP-binding protein LolD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lipoprotein releasing system, ATP-binding protein", "short" "LolD_lipo_ATP-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1416, "taxa" 6898, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7071, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7071, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5488}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0207", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0207"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
