{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Four genes from the major Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis locus have been shown to encode proteins that are similar to the Salmonella typhimurium FlgB, FlgC, FlgG and FliF proteins; a further gene product is similar to the Escherichia coli FliE protein [[cite:PUB00001805]]. All of these proteins are thought to form part of the hook-basal body complex of the bacterial flagella [[cite:PUB00001805]]. The FlgB, FlgC and FlgG proteins are components of the proximal and distal rods; FliF forms the M-ring that anchors the rod assembly to the membrane; but the role of FliE has not yet been determined [[cite:PUB00001805]]. The similarity between the proteins in these two organisms suggests that the structures of the M-ring and the rod may be similar [[cite:PUB00001805]]. Nevertheless, some differences in size and amino acid composition between some of the homologues suggest the basal body proteins may be organised slightly differently within B. subtilis [[cite:PUB00001805]].</p>\r\n<p>From gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of 35S-labelled S. typhimurium hook-basal body complexes and the deduced number of sulphur-containing residues in FliE, the stoichiometry of the protein in the hook-basal body complex has been estimated to be about nine subunits [[cite:PUB00002168]]. FliE does not undergo cleavage of a signal peptide, nor does it show any similarity to the axial components like the rod or hook proteins, which are thought to be exported by the flagellum-specific export pathway [[cite:PUB00002168]]. On this evidence, it has been suggested that FliE may be in the vicinity of the MS ring, perhaps acting as an adaptor protein between ring and rod substructures [[cite:PUB00002168]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34653" "PTHR34653"}, "hamap" {"MF_00724" "Flagellar hook-basal body complex protein FliE [fliE]"}, "pfam" {"PF02049" "Flagellar hook-basal body complex protein FliE"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00205" "flagellar hook-basal body complex protein FliE"}, "prints" {"PR01006" "FLGHOOKFLIE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flagellar hook-basal body complex protein FliE", "short" "FliE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 4444, "taxa" 17456, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19262, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19262, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15031}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0880", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0880"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001624", :literature {"PUB00001805" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Zuberi AR" "Ying C" "Bischoff DS" "Ordal GW."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1119(91)90220-6", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Gene-protein relationships in the flagellar hook-basal body complex of Bacillus subtilis: sequences of the flgB, flgC, flgG, fliE and fliF genes.", "year" 1991, "raw_pages" "23-31", "volume" "101", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1905667}, "PUB00002168" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Muller V" "Jones CJ" "Kawagishi I" "Aizawa S" "Macnab RM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
