{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents the protease responsible for the proteolysis of head proteins, a critical step in the morphogenesis of many tailed phages. Cleavage facilitates the conversion of the prohead to the mature capsid. All these cleavages are carried out by action at consensus S/A/G-X-E recognition sequences at 39 cleavage sites. Evidence of multiple processing sites in nine phiKZ proteins appears to represent a built-in mechanism by which the phage ensures that the majority of the propeptide regions are removed, and emphasizes the essential nature of processing in phiKZ-head morphogenesis [[cite:PUB00066735]]. The family is classified by MEROPS as a serine peptidase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20034" "Peptidase S80 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S80 family", "short" "Peptidase_S80"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 56, "taxa" 346, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 213, "sets" 0, "proteins" 213, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
