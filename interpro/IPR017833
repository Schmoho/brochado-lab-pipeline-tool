{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry are members of the radical SAM superfamily of enzymes that utilise an iron-sulphur redox cluster and S-adenosylmethionine to carry out diverse radical mediated reactions [[cite:PUB00010539]]. This group of proteins are frequently encoded in the same locus as squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, [interpro:IPR006400]) and other proteins associated with the biosynthesis of hopanoid natural products. The linkage between SHC and this radical SAM enzyme is strong; one is nearly always observed in the same genome where the other is found. A hopanoid biosynthesis locus was described in Zymomonas mobilis consisting of the genes for HpnA-E and SHC (HpnF) [[cite:PUB00042985]]. Continuing past SHC are the genes for a phosphorylase enzyme (ZMO0873, i.e. HpnG, [interpro:IPR017831]) and this radical SAM enzyme (ZMO0874) which we name here HpnH. Granted, in Z. mobilis, HpnH is in a convergent orientation with respect to HpnA-G, but one gene beyond HpnH and running in the same convergent direction is IspH (ZM0875, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase), an essential enzyme of IPP biosynthesis and therefore essential for the biosynthesis of hopanoids. One of the well-described hopanoid intermediates is bacteriohopanetetrol. In the conversion from hopene several reactions must occur in the side chain for which a radical mechanism might be reasonable. These include the four (presumably anaerobic) hydroxylations and a methyl shift.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00397" "adenosyl-hopene transferase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03470" "adenosyl-hopene transferase HpnH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hopanoid biosynthesis associated radical SAM protein HpnH", "short" "Hopanoid_synth-assoc_rSAM_HpnH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1219, "taxa" 5016, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5186, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5186, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3872}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017833", :literature {"PUB00010539" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Sofia HJ" "Chen G" "Hetzler BG" "Reyes-Spindola JF" "Miller NE."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/29.5.1097", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Radical SAM, a novel protein superfamily linking unresolved steps in familiar biosynthetic pathways with radical mechanisms: functional characterization using new analysis and information visualization methods.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1097-106", "volume" "29", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11222759}, "PUB00042985" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Perzl M" "Reipen IG" "Schmitz S" "Poralla K" "Sahm H" "Sprenger GA" "Kannenberg EL."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
