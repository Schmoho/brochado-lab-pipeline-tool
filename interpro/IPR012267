{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group of proteins are serine peptidases belonging to MEROPS peptidase family S1, subfamily S1A (chymotrypsin, clan PA(S)). Members of this family are found specifically within the acrosomal vesicle of all mammalian spermatozoa. Acrosin is thought to be involved in the recognition and binding of the sperm to the zona pellucida of the ovum and the sperm penetration through the zona pellucida. Mouse knock-out mutants suggest that Acr- sperm have a selective disadvantage when they are in competition with Acr+ sper [[cite:PUB00016218]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043504", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan, chymotrypsin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009003", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001141" "Acrosin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase S1A, acrosin", "short" "Pept_S1A_acrosin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 307, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 129, "sets" 0, "proteins" 126, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 75}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
