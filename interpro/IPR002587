{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase ([ec:5.5.1.4]), also known as Inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1 (INO1), is a key enzyme in myo-inositol biosynthesis pathway that catalyses the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate in a NAD-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00106885], [cite:PUB00101379]]. The enzyme exists in a cytoplasmic form in a wide range of plants, animals, and fungi. It has also been detected in several bacteria and a chloroplast form is observed in alga and higher plants. Inositol phosphates play an important role in signal transduction.</p>\n\n<p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), the transcriptional regulation of the INO1 gene has been studied in detail [[cite:PUB00005654]] and its expression is sensitive to the availability of phospholipid precursors as well as growth phase. The regulation of the structural gene encoding 1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase has also been analysed at the transcriptional level in the aquatic angiosperm, Spirodela polyrrhiza (Giant duckweed) and the halophyte, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Common ice plant) [[cite:PUB00006393]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3qvs", "name" "L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus wild type"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036291", "name" "NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07994" "Myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF015578" "Myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase"}, "panther" {"PTHR11510" "MYO-INOSITOL-1 PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase", "short" "Myo-inos-1-P_Synthase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 73, "proteomes" 4913, "taxa" 18241, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19389, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19229, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14369}, "pathways" 14}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
