{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NocN shares 75% sequence identity with NosN and thus is thought to have a very similar function. NosN shares high sequence similarity to various putative methyltransferases with a radical S-AdoMet-dependent manner, including Tlm-Orf11 (32% identity) in tallysomycin biosynthesis. Experimental characterization shows that NosN functions as a methyltransferase and acts on the 3-methylindolyl group (product of the NosL enzyme's reaction) at the C-4 position for furnishing the 3,4-dimethylindolyl moiety [[cite:PUB00083542], [cite:PUB00083543]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023404", "name" "Radical SAM, alpha/beta horseshoe", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00434" "3-methyl-2-indolic acid methyltransferase (NocN/NosN like)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-Methyl-2-indolic acid methyltransferase, NocN/NosN-like", "short" "NocN/NosN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 34, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR034436", :literature {"PUB00083543" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Ding Y" "Yu Y" "Pan H" "Guo H" "Li Y" "Liu W."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c005121g", "medline_journal" "Mol Biosyst", "title" "Moving posttranslational modifications forward to biosynthesize the glycosylated thiopeptide nocathiacin I in Nocardia sp.
