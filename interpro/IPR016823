{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are SoxX, a c-type cytochrome with a CxxCH motif, part of a heterodimer with SoxA. SoxAX cytochromes play a key role in bacterial thiosulfate oxidation [[cite:PUB00021732], [cite:PUB00074852]].</p>\n\n<p>There are three distinct types of SoxAX proteins. Type I and II SoxAX proteins are heterodimers, while the heterotrimeric SoxAXK proteins form the third group. Type I SoxAX proteins have SoxA subunits with two heme groups and SoxX subunits with a molecular mass of approximately 14kDa, while the Type II SoxA proteins only contain one heme group, and are associated with SoxX proteins that have a molecular mass of approximately 20kDa. The increased molecular mass in these SoxX proteins is largely due to the presence of an N-terminal extension [[cite:PUB00074853]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3oa8", "name" "Diheme SoxAX"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF024608" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, UCP024608 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sulfur oxidation c-type cytochrome SoxX, type II", "short" "Thiosulf_SoxX_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 185, "taxa" 870, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 839, "sets" 0, "proteins" 838, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 601}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR016823", :literature {"PUB00074853" {"URL" nil, "issue" "28", "authors" ["Kilmartin JR" "Maher MJ" "Krusong K" "Noble CJ" "Hanson GR" "Bernhardt PV" "Riley MJ" "Kappler U."], "ISO_journal" "J.
