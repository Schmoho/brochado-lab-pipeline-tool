Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (also known as TNF-alpha or cachectin) is a monocyte-derived cytotoxin that has been implicated in tumour regression, septic shock and cachexia [[cite:PUB00006091], [cite:PUB00006095]]. The protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine [[cite:PUB00006101]]. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers [[cite:PUB00006098]]. Both the mature protein and a partially-processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide [[cite:PUB00006098]].</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of different families of TNF, but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that are recognised by their specific receptors.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4tsv", "name" "HIGH RESOLUTION CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF A HUMAN TNF-ALPHA MUTANT"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008983", "name" "Tumour necrosis factor-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01234" "TNECROSISFCT"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tumour necrosis factor", "short" "TNF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 63, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 610, "taxa" 2334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8461, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2211, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1592}, "pathways" 58}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006053", :literature {"PUB00006091" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Fransen L" "Muller R" "Marmenout A" "Tavernier J" "Van der Heyden J" "Kawashima E" "Chollet A" "Tizard R" "Van Heuverswyn H" "Van Vliet A."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/13.12.4417", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Molecular cloning of mouse tumour necrosis factor cDNA and its eukaryotic expression.", "year" 1985, "raw_pages" "4417-29", "volume" "13", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 2989794}, "PUB00006095" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kriegler M" "Perez C" "DeFay K" "Albert I" "Lu SD."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(88)90486-2", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A novel form of TNF/cachectin is a cell surface cytotoxic transmembrane protein: ramifications for the complex physiology of TNF.", "year" 1988, "raw_pages" "45-53", "volume" "53", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 3349526}, "PUB00006101" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sherry B" "Jue DM" "Zentella A" "Cerami A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
