{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial, ATP-forming succinate--CoA ligase (SUCLA;[ec:6.2.1.5]) from eukaryotes.  The ligase functions in the citric acid cycle (TCA), and is a heterodimer of an alpha and beta subunit.    It couples the hydrolysis of succinyl-CoA to the synthesis of ATP which is the only substrate-level phosphorylation step in the TCA. The beta subunit provides nucleotide specificity of the enzyme and binds the substrate succinate, while the binding sites for coenzyme A and phosphate are found in the alpha subunit.  GTP-forming succinate--CoA ligase has the same alpha subunit but a different beta subunit [[cite:PUB00018991]].  Deficiency of SUCLA activity is associated with encephalomyopathy and mitochondrial DNA depletion [[cite:PUB00084222]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_03220" "Succinate--CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial [SUCLA2]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Succinate--CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial", "short" "Succ_CoA_betaA_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 906, "taxa" 3766, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1701, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1701, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1105}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
