{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains proteins with WD40 repeats and includes protein transport protein SEC31, which is a component of the coat protein complex II (COPII).  COPII promotes the formation of transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum by deformating the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into vesicles and selectiing cargo molecules [[cite:PUB00090763]].  In humans and other mammals, there are two SEC31 proteins known as SEC31A and SEC31B [[cite:PUB00090764]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13923" "SEC31-RELATED PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein transport protein SEC31-like", "short" "SEC31-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2585, "taxa" 8819, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9108, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9108, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4869}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR040251", :literature {"PUB00090763" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Salama NR" "Chuang JS" "Schekman RW."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
