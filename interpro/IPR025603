{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the colicin M immunity protein Cmi, and the protein of unknown function YebF. Cmi protects cells from the colicin M toxin, though the mechanism by which it achieves this is not known [[cite:PUB00057375]]. The protein forms an α-β fold and contains a disulphide bond that is essential for function [[cite:PUB00057376]]. Although the function of YbeF is not known, it is secreted by E. coli, and contains the two conserved cysteine residues responsible for the disulphide bond in Cmi [[cite:PUB00053960]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4aeq", "name" "Crystal structure of the dimeric immunity protein Cmi solved by direct methods (Arcimboldo)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038703", "name" "YebF/Cmi superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"profile" {"PS51979" "YebF/Cmi domain profile"}, "pfam" {"PF13995" "YebF-like protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YebF/Colicin-M immunity protein", "short" "YebF/ColM_immunity"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 70, "taxa" 836, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 975, "sets" 0, "proteins" 975, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 780}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR025603", :literature {"PUB00057375" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Olschlager T" "Braun V."], "ISO_journal" "J.
