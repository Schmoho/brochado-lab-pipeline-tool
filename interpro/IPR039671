{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes THEMIS1/2/3 from animals. THEMIS1 and THEMIS2 are restricted to B and myeloid cells, and the more distantly related THEMIS3 is expressed in the large and small intestine. THEMIS is involved in the early TCR (T-cell antigen receptor) signal transduction and thymocyte selection [[cite:PUB00089936]]. It is recruited to LAT through GRB2 association and LAT phosphotyrosine GRB2 binding sites [[cite:PUB00089936]]. THEMIS contains CABIT modules that bind directly to the SHP-1 PTP (protein tyrosine phosphatase) domain and inhibit SHP-1 PTP activity by promoting or stabilizing oxidation of the catalytic cysteine [[cite:PUB00089941]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15215" "CABIT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein THEMIS", "short" "THEMIS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 642, "taxa" 2257, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1764, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1764, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1118}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039671", :literature {"PUB00089936" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Gascoigne NR" "Acuto O."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
