{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Quinolinate synthetase catalyses the second step of the<i>de novo</i>biosynthetic pathway of pyridine nucleotide formation. In particular, quinolinate synthetase is involved in the condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and iminoaspartate to form quinolinic acid [[cite:PUB00009471]]. This synthesis requires two enzymes, an FAD-containing \"B protein\" and an \"A protein\". B protein converts L-aspartate to iminoaspartate. The A protein, NadA, converts iminoaspartate to quinolate. NadA harbours a [4Fe-4S] cluster [[cite:PUB00070332]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6nso", "name" "An Unexpected Intermediate in the Reaction Catalyzed by Quinolinate Synthase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036094", "name" "Quinolinate synthetase A superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30573" "QUINOLINATE SYNTHETASE A"}, "pfam" {"PF02445" "Quinolinate synthetase A protein"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00550" "quinolinate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Quinolinate synthetase A", "short" "NadA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 56, "proteomes" 7149, "taxa" 28950, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34059, "sets" 0, "proteins" 34028, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 26121}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0057", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0057"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
