{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ras-related protein Rab9 is a member of the large Rab GTPase family. It is found in late endosomes, together with mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) and the tail-interacting protein of 47kDa (TIP47). Rab9 is a key mediator of vesicular transport from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by redirecting the MPRs [[cite:PUB00091897]]. Rab9 has been identified as a key component for the replication of several viruses, including HIV1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles, making it a potential target for inhibiting a variety of viruses [[cite:PUB00091896]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Rabs are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins [[cite:PUB00020223], [cite:PUB00033000]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1wms", "name" "High resolution crystal structure of human Rab9 GTPase: a novel antiviral drug target"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd04116" "Rab GTPase family 9 (Rab9)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rab9", "short" "Rab9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 630, "taxa" 2144, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1485, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1485, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1102}, "pathways" 18}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR041824", :literature {"PUB00020223" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Stenmark H" "Olkkonen VM."], "ISO_journal" "Genome Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=11387043&action=stream&blobtype=pdf", "medline_journal" "Genome Biol", "title" "The Rab GTPase family.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "REVIEWS3007", "volume" "2", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11387043}, "PUB00033000" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Dumas JJ" "Zhu Z" "Connolly JL" "Lambright DG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80054-9", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural basis of activation and GTP hydrolysis in Rab proteins.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "413-23", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10196122}, "PUB00091897" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Ganley IG" "Carroll K" "Bittova L" "Pfeffer S."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
