{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the DNA gyrase inhibitor YacG family.  \r\nE coli. YacG inhibits all the catalytic activities of DNA gyrase by preventing its interaction with DNA. It acts by binding directly to the C-terminal domain of GyrB, which probably disrupts DNA binding by the gyrase [[cite:PUB00060604]]. YacG has been shown to bind zinc and contains the structural motifs typical of zinc-binding proteins [[cite:PUB00022116]]. The conserved four cysteine motif in this protein (-C-X(2)-C-X(15)-C-X(3)-C-) is not found in other zinc-binding proteins with known structures.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013088", "name" "Zinc finger, NHR/GATA-type", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36150" "DNA GYRASE INHIBITOR YACG"}, "hamap" {"MF_00649" "DNA gyrase inhibitor YacG [yacG]"}, "pfam" {"PF03884" "DNA gyrase inhibitor YacG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA gyrase inhibitor YacG", "short" "DNA_gyrase_inhibitor_YacG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 2829, "taxa" 11570, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12407, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9636}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005584", :literature {"PUB00022116" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ramelot TA" "Cort JR" "Yee AA" "Semesi A" "Edwards AM" "Arrowsmith CH" "Kennedy MA."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10214", "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "NMR structure of the Escherichia coli protein YacG: a novel sequence motif in the zinc-finger family of proteins.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "289-93", "volume" "49", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12211008}, "PUB00060604" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Sengupta S" "Nagaraja V."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn355", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "YacG from Escherichia coli is a specific endogenous inhibitor of DNA gyrase.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "4310-6", "volume" "36", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18586829}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0008270", "name" "zinc ion binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005584", "name" "DNA gyrase inhibitor YacG", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 35, "alignment:full" 2787}}}
