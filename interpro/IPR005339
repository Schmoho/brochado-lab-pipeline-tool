{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA replication in eukaryotes results from a highly coordinated interaction between proteins, often as part of protein complexes, and the DNA template. One of the key early steps leading to DNA replication is formation of the prereplication complex, or pre-RC. The pre-RC is formed by the sequential binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins, and the MCM complex. Activation of the pre-RC into the initiation complex (IC) is achieved via the action of S-phase kinases, eventually leading to the loading of the replication machinery.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, a novel replication complex, GINS (for Go, Ichi, Nii, and San; five, one, two, and three in Japanese), has been identified [[cite:PUB00012381], [cite:PUB00015004]]. The precise function of GINS is not known. However, genetic and two-hybrid interactions indicate that it mediates the loading of the enzymatic replication machinery at a step after the action of the S-phase kinases [[cite:PUB00015004]]. Furthermore, GINS may be a part of the replication machinery itself, since it is found associated with replicating DNA [[cite:PUB00012381], [cite:PUB00015004]]. Electron microscopy of GINS shows that it forms a ring-like structure [[cite:PUB00012381]], reminiscent of the structure of PCNA [[cite:PUB00015005]], the DNA polymerase delta replication clamp.This observation, coupled with the observed interactions for GINS, indicates that the complex may represent the replication clamp for DNA polymerase epsilon [[cite:PUB00012381]].</p>\r\n<p>This family of proteins represents the PSF1 component (for partner of SLD five) of the GINS complex.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036224", "name" "GINS, helical bundle-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd11710" "Alpha-helical domain of GINS complex protein Psf1"}, "panther" {"PTHR12914" "PARTNER OF SLD5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GINS complex, subunit Psf1", "short" "GINS_Psf1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 42, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2529, "taxa" 8630, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4230, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4198, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2764}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR005339", :literature {"PUB00012381" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Kubota Y" "Takase Y" "Komori Y" "Hashimoto Y" "Arata T" "Kamimura Y" "Araki H" "Takisawa H."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1070003", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "A novel ring-like complex of Xenopus proteins essential for the initiation of DNA replication.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1141-52", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12730133}, "PUB00015004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Takayama Y" "Kamimura Y" "Okawa M" "Muramatsu S" "Sugino A" "Araki H."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.1065903", "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "GINS, a novel multiprotein complex required for chromosomal DNA replication in budding yeast.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1153-65", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12730134}, "PUB00015005" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Krishna TS" "Kong XP" "Gary S" "Burgers PM" "Kuriyan J."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(94)90014-0", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "Crystal structure of the eukaryotic DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA.", "year" 1994, "raw_pages" "1233-43", "volume" "79", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 8001157}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0006260", "name" "DNA replication", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000811", "name" "GINS complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR005339", "name" "GINS complex, subunit Psf1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
