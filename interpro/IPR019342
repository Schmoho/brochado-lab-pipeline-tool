{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry form part of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I. Complex I is the first multisubunit inner membrane protein complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and it transfers two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. The mammalian complex I is composed of 45 different subunits. The proteins in this entry represent a component of the iron-sulphur (IP) fragment of the enzyme, that is not involved in catalysis. These proteins carry four highly conserved cysteine residues, but these do not appear to be in a configuration which would favour metal binding, so the exact function of the protein is uncertain [[cite:PUB00044394]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10200" "NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, NDUFS5-15kDa"}, "panther" {"PTHR15224" "NADH DEHYDROGENASE [UBIQUINONE] IRON-SULFUR PROTEIN 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, iron-sulphur subunit 5", "short" "NADH_UbQ_OxRdtase_FeS-su5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 229, "domain_architectures" 26, "proteomes" 2101, "taxa" 7334, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3225, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3220, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2064}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1230", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1230"} {"accession" "GenProp1637", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1637"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR019342", :literature {"PUB00044394" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Loeffen J" "Smeets R" "Smeitink J" "Triepels R" "Sengers R" "Trijbels F" "van den Heuvel L."], "ISO_journal" "J.
