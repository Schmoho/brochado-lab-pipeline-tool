{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>RsmH (previously known as MraW) is a methyltransferase responsible for one of the two methylations (N4-methylation) of C1402 in Escherichia coli 16S rRNA. The N4, 2'-O-dimethylcytidine (m4Cm) at position 1402 of the 16S rRNA directly interacts with the P-site codon of the mRNA. These conserved methyl-modifications may play a role in fine-tuning the shape and function of the P-site, thus increasing decoding fidelity [[cite:PUB00054204]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8ipk", "name" "The structure of human mitochondrial methyltransferase METTL15 with SAM"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023397", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase, MraW, recognition domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11265" "S-ADENOSYL-METHYLTRANSFERASE MRAW"}, "hamap" {"MF_01007" "Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase H [rsmH]"}, "pfam" {"PF01795" "MraW methylase family"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF004486" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferase, MraW type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00006" "16S rRNA (cytosine(1402)-N(4))-methyltransferase RsmH"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase H", "short" "RsmH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 107, "proteomes" 10565, "taxa" 42150, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 49018, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48934, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 37241}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1082", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1082"} {"accession" "GenProp0802", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0802"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
