{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the ring hydroxylating dioxygenase beta subunit. This subunit has a similar structure to NTF-2, Ketosteroid isomerase and scytalone dehydratase. The degradation of aromatic compounds by aerobic bacteria frequently begins with the dihydroxylation of the substrate by nonhaem iron-containing dioxygenases. These enzymes consist of two or three soluble proteins that interact to form an electron-transport chain that transfers electrons from reduced nucleotides (NADH) via flavin and [2Fe-2S] redox centres to a terminal dioxygenase [[cite:PUB00000122]]. Aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases oxidise aromatic hydrocarbons and related compounds to cis-arene diols. These enzymes utilise a mononuclear non-haem iron centre to catalyse the addition of dioxygen to their respective substrates. The active site of these enzymes however is in the alpha subunit. No functional role has been attributed to the beta subunit except for a structural role [[cite:PUB00005305]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2b1x", "name" "Crystal structure of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from Rhodococcus sp."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032710", "name" "NTF2-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00667" "ring_hydroxylating_dioxygenases_beta"}, "panther" {"PTHR41534" "BLR3401 PROTEIN"}, "pfam" {"PF00866" "Ring hydroxylating beta subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase beta subunit", "short" "Rng_hydr_dOase-bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 59, "domain_architectures" 9, "proteomes" 1319, "taxa" 6244, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11927, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11926, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 9552}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1287", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1287"} {"accession" "GenProp1458", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1458"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
