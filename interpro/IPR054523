{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes Complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 from Borreliella burgdorferi (CRASP-2, also known as CspZ, [swissprot:O50665]), the causative agent of Lyme disease. CRASP-2 can bind both the major alternative pathway complement regulator factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL-1), contributing to the resistance of the bacteria to the host's immune response. This protein consists of a single domain almost entirely formed by Î±-helices [pdbe:4bg0] [[cite:PUB00153892]].
