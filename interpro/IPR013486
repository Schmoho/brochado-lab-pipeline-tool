{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes a region which is found, typically in two or three proteins per genome, in Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes, and sporadically in other genomes. One example is SpoIID from Bacillus subtilis. Another, also from B. subtilis, is LytB which contains this region at the C terminus. LytB is encoded immediately upstream of an amidase, the autolysin LytC, and both these proteins show considerable homology in their N-terminal regions.  Genes encoding proteins in this entry do not occur in conserved neighbourhoods, and many, such as SpoIID are monocistronic. One modeling study [[cite:PUB00020772]] has suggested that SpoIID may bind DNA, but the function of these proteins is so far unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5txu", "name" "1.95 Angstrom Resolution Crystal Structure of Stage II Sporulation Protein D (SpoIID) from Clostridium difficile in Apo Conformation"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02669" "SpoIID/LytB domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation stage II protein D, amidase enhancer LytB", "short" "SpoIID/LytB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2217, "taxa" 9960, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16397, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16390, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12019}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013486", :literature {"PUB00020772" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Holland SK" "Cutting S" "Mandelstam J."], "ISO_journal" "J.
