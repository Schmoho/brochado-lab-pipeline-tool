{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of haemolysin expression modulating protein (Hha) from Escherichia coli and its enterobacterial homologues, such as YmoA from Yersinia enterocolitica, and RmoA encoded on the R100 plasmid. These proteins act as modulators of bacterial gene expression. Members of the Hha/YmoA/RmoA family act in conjunction with members of the H-NS family, participating in the thermoregulation of different virulence factors and in plasmid transfer [[cite:PUB00014318]]. Hha, along with the chromatin-associated protein H-NS, is involved in the regulation of expression of the toxin alpha-haemolysin in response to osmolarity and temperature [[cite:PUB00014317]]. YmoA modulates the expression of various virulence factors, such as Yop proteins and YadA adhesin, in response to temperature. RmoA is a plasmid R100 modulator involved in plasmid transfer [[cite:PUB00014319]]. The HHA family of proteins display striking similarity to the oligomerization domain of the H-NS proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036666", "name" "HHA superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05321" "Haemolysin expression modulating protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haemolysin expression modulating, HHA", "short" "Hemolysn_expr_modulating_HHA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 151, "taxa" 1317, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3191, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3191, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2468}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1206", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1206"} {"accession" "GenProp1182", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1182"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007985", :literature {"PUB00014317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Nieto JM" "Madrid C" "Miquelay E" "Parra JL" "Rodriguez S" "Juarez A."], "ISO_journal" "J.
