{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes CD72 from mammals and similar proteins from vertebrates. Human CD72 is a membrane protein expressed mostly in B cells. It contains a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) in the extracellular region and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic region. It is involved in B-cell proliferation and differentiation [[cite:PUB00089981]]. It plays a role in regulation of the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease characterised by production of autoantibodies to various nuclear components and inflammatory lesions caused by deposition of immune complexes [[cite:PUB00089979]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5b1r", "name" "Crystal structure of mouse CD72a CTLD"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15028" "CD72-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "B-cell differentiation antigen CD72", "short" "CD72"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 556, "taxa" 2113, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1409, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1409, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 926}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039689", :literature {"PUB00089981" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wu HJ" "Bondada S."], "ISO_journal" "J.
