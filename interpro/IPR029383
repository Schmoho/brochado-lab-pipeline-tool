While ARL-6 protein was predominantly cytosolic, it is known to bind to SEC61-beta subunit of a protein conducting channel SEC61p [[cite:PUB00070036]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28640" "ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 6-INTERACTING PROTEIN 6"}, "pfam" {"PF15062" "Haemopoietic lineage transmembrane helix"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6-interacting protein 6", "short" "ARL6IP6"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 5, "proteomes" 374, "taxa" 1787, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 728, "sets" 0, "proteins" 725, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 449}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029383", :literature {"PUB00070036" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Ingley E" "Williams JH" "Walker CE" "Tsai S" "Colley S" "Sayer MS" "Tilbrook PA" "Sarna M" "Beaumont JG" "Klinken SP."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01188-6", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "A novel ADP-ribosylation like factor (ARL-6), interacts with the protein-conducting channel SEC61beta subunit.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "69-74", "volume" "459", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10508919}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR029383", "name" "ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6-interacting protein 6", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 434}}}
