{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes the hypothetical Rhizobium sp. protein Y4yA and similar uncharacterized bacterial proteins. These proteins are homologous to eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DapDC). ODC and DapDC are fold type III PLP-dependent enzymes that contain an N-terminal PLP-binding TIM-barrel domain and a C-terminal Î²-sandwich domain, similar to bacterial alanine racemases. ODC participates in the formation of putrescine by catalyzing the decarboxylation of ornithine, the first step in polyamine biosynthesis. DapDC participates in the last step of lysine biosynthesis, the conversion of meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate to L-lysine. Proteins in this entry may function as PLP-dependent decarboxylases [[cite:PUB00031576], [cite:PUB00024775]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029066", "name" "PLP-binding barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06842" "Type III Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-Dependent Enzyme Y4yA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Uncharacterized protein Y4yA-like", "short" "Y4yA-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 151, "taxa" 698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 401}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042152", :literature {"PUB00031576" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Ray SS" "Bonanno JB" "Rajashankar KR" "Pinho MG" "He G" "De Lencastre H" "Tomasz A" "Burley SK."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(02)00880-8", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Cocrystal structures of diaminopimelate decarboxylase: mechanism, evolution, and inhibition of an antibiotic resistance accessory factor.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1499-508", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12429091}, "PUB00024775" {"URL" nil, "issue" "37", "authors" ["Jackson LK" "Brooks HB" "Osterman AL" "Goldsmith EJ" "Phillips MA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi001209s", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Altering the reaction specificity of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "11247-57", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10985770}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000183", "name" "Ornithine/DAP/Arg decarboxylase", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR002433", "name" "Ornithine decarboxylase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002985", "name" "Arginine decarboxylase", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR002986", "name" "Diaminopimelate decarboxylase, LysA", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017530", "name" "Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase, exosortase system type 1 associated", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR042152", "name" "Uncharacterized protein Y4yA-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
