{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoglucose isomerase ([ec:5.3.1.9]) (PGI) [[cite:PUB00004511], [cite:PUB00003422]] is a dimeric enzyme that catalyses the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. PGI is involved in different pathways: in most higher organisms it is involved in glycolysis; in mammals it is involved in gluconeogenesis; in plants in carbohydrate biosynthesis; in some bacteria it provides a gateway for fructose into the Entner-Doudouroff pathway. The multifunctional protein, PGI, is also known as neuroleukin (a neurotrophic factor that mediates the differentiation of neurons), autocrine motility factor (a tumour-secreted cytokine that regulates cell motility), differentiation and maturation mediator and myofibril-bound serine proteinase inhibitor, and has different roles inside and outside the cell. In the cytoplasm, it catalyses the second step in glycolysis, while outside the cell it serves as a nerve growth factor and cytokine [[cite:PUB00006471]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3ljk", "name" "Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase from Francisella tularensis."}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR046348", "name" "SIS domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023096", "name" "Phosphoglucose isomerase, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00473" "Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [pgi]"}, "pfam" {"PF00342" "Phosphoglucose isomerase"}, "profile" {"PS51463" "Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase family profile"}, "panther" {"PTHR11469" "GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE ISOMERASE"}, "prints" {"PR00662" "G6PISOMERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)", "short" "G6P_Isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 64, "domain_architectures" 212, "proteomes" 11678, "taxa" 48830, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 57992, "sets" 0, "proteins" 57514, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 42484}, "pathways" 50}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00157", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00157"}]}, "gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1492", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1492"} {"accession" "GenProp0120", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0120"} {"accession" "GenProp1599", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1599"} {"accession" "GenProp1639", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1639"} {"accession" "GenProp1580", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1580"} {"accession" "GenProp1344", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1344"} {"accession" "GenProp1612", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1612"} {"accession" "GenProp0694", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0694"} {"accession" "GenProp1443", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1443"} {"accession" "GenProp1306", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1306"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
