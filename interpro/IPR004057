{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Microtubules are polymers of tubulin, a dimer of two 55kDa subunits, designated alpha and beta [[cite:PUB00000039], [cite:PUB00000978]]. Within the microtubule lattice, α-β heterodimers associate in a head-to-tail fashion, giving rise to microtubule polarity. Fluorescent labelling studies have suggested that tubulin is oriented in microtubules with beta-tubulin toward the plus end [[cite:PUB00006112]].</p>\n\n<p>For maximal rate and extent of polymerisation into microtubules, tubulin requires GTP. Two molecules of GTP are bound at different sites, termed N and E. At the E (Exchangeable) site, GTP is hydrolysed during incorporation into the microtubule. Close to the E site is an invariant region rich in glycine residues, which is found in both chains and is thought to control access of the nucleotide to its binding site [[cite:PUB00002443]].</p>\n\n<p>Most species, excepting simple eukaryotes, express a variety of closely-related alpha- and beta-isotypes. A third family member, gamma tubulin, has also been identified in a number of species. Gamma tubulin is found at microtubule-organising centres, such as the spindle poles or the centrosome, suggesting that it is involved in minus-end nucleation of microtubule assembly [[cite:PUB00000721]]. More recently, epsilon-tubulin has been identified in humans [[cite:PUB00007321]] and Trypanosomes [[cite:PUB00007322]]. In Tetrahymena [[cite:PUB00072958]] is required for the assembly and maintenance of the triplet microtubule blades of basal bodies. In humans, it has been localised to centrosomes [[cite:PUB00007321]]. It is required for centriole duplication and organisation of the pericentriolar material [[cite:PUB00063568]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036525", "name" "Tubulin/FtsZ, GTPase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01519" "EPSLNTUBULIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Epsilon tubulin", "short" "Epsilon_tubulin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1046, "taxa" 4470, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16469, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2250, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1566}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004057", :literature {"PUB00007321" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chang P" "Stearns T."], "ISO_journal" "Nat.
