{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin: coenzyme M methyltransferase subunit C in methanogenic archaea. This methyltranferase is a membrane-associated enzyme complex that uses methyl-transfer reaction to drive a sodium-ion pump. Archaea have evolved energy-yielding pathways marked by one-carbon biochemistry featuring novel cofactors and enzymes. This transferase is involved in the transfer of a methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M. In an accompanying reaction, methane is produced by two-electron reduction of the methyl moiety in methyl-coenzyme M by another enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01096" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase subunit C [mtrC]"}, "pfam" {"PF04211" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, subunit C"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006530" "N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin--coenzyme M methyltransferase, subunit C"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01148" "tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase subunit MtrC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, subunit C", "short" "THM_MeTrfase_su_C"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 63, "taxa" 516, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 467, "sets" 0, "proteins" 467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 410}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0722"} {"accession" "GenProp0288", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0288"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
