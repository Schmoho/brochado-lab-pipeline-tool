{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1; [ec:2.1.1.37]), which methylates CpG residues, with a preference for hemimethylated DNA. It is responsible for maintaining methylation patterns established in development. DNA methylation is coordinated with methylation of histones. Dnmt1 mediates transcriptional repression (silencing) by establishing a repressive transcription complex where the N terminus of Dnmt1 binds to HDAC2 (histone deacetylase-2) as well as to DMAP1 (Dnmt1-associated protein) [[cite:PUB00011312]]. LSH, which is related to the SNF2 chromatin-remodelling ATPases, is also required for efficient DNA methylation [[cite:PUB00044671]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037404" "DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1, DNMT1 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1-like", "short" "DNMT1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 982, "taxa" 4091, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7794, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2798, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 418}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
