{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the copper storage protein (Csp1) and related proteins. Members of this family average about 150 amino acids in length, beginning with a twin-arginine translocation signal sequence, then a His-rich spacer region, followed by a ~105-residue region in which thirteen positions are nearly invariant Cys residues.</p>\n\n<p>Csp1 is a tetramer of four-helix bundles with each monomer binding up to 13 Cu(I) ions via the Cys residues that point into the core of the bundle [[cite:PUB00106836]]. The fact that the tetrameric Csp1 is capable of binding up to 52 Cu(I) ions is consistent with a role in copper storage. Experimental data suggests that Csp1 is exported from the cytosol, and stores copper for particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8r4m", "name" "CSP1 M48L mutant with Iodide"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04401" "Csp1 family four helix bundle copper storage protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Copper storage protein 1 family", "short" "Csp1_Cys_rich"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 639, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 413, "sets" 0, "proteins" 413, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 302}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030913", :literature {"PUB00106836" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7567", "authors" ["Vita N" "Platsaki S" "Basle A" "Allen SJ" "Paterson NG" "Crombie AT" "Murrell JC" "Waldron KJ" "Dennison C."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "A four-helix bundle stores copper for methane oxidation.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "140-3", "volume" "525", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26308900}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030913", "name" "Copper storage protein 1 family", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
