{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The myelin sheath is a multi-layered membrane, unique to the nervous system, that functions as an insulator to greatly increase the velocity of axonal impulse conduction [[cite:PUB00002447]]. Myelin basic protein (MBP) [[cite:PUB00000989], [cite:PUB00003466]] is a hydrophilic protein that may function to maintain the correct structure of myelin, interacting with the lipids in the myelin membrane by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. In mammals various forms of MBP exist which are produced by the alternative splicing of a single gene; these forms differ by the presence or the absence of short (10 to 20 residues) peptides in various internal locations in the sequence. The major form of MBP is generally a protein of about 18.5 Kd (170 residues). MBP is the target of many post-translational modifications: it is N-terminally acetylated, methylated on an arginine residue, phosphorylated by various serine/threonine protein-kinases, and deamidated on some glutamine residues.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1fv1", "name" "STRUCTURAL BASIS FOR THE BINDING OF AN IMMUNODOMINANT PEPTIDE FROM MYELIN BASIC PROTEIN IN DIFFERENT REGISTERS BY TWO HLA-DR2 ALLELES"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prosite" {"PS00569" "Myelin basic protein signature"}, "pfam" {"PF01669" "Myelin basic protein"}, "prints" {"PR00212" "MYELINMBP"}, "panther" {"PTHR11429" "MYELIN BASIC PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myelin basic protein", "short" "Myelin_BP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 630, "taxa" 2175, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2382, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2355, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1510}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00492", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00492"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000548", :literature {"PUB00002447" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Sakamoto Y" "Kitamura K" "Yoshimura K" "Nishijima T" "Uyemura K."], "ISO_journal" "J.
