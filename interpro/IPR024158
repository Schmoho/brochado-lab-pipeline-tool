{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mitochondrial functions rely on the correct transport of resident proteins synthesized in the cytosol to mitochondria. Protein import into mitochondria is mediated by membrane protein complexes, protein translocators, in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, in cooperation with their assistant proteins in the cytosol, intermembrane space and matrix. Proteins destined to the mitochondrial matrix cross the outer membrane with the aid of the outer membrane translocator, the tOM40 complex, and then the inner membrane with the aid of the inner membrane translocator, the TIM23 complex, and mitochondrial motor and chaperone (MMC) proteins including mitochondrial heat- shock protein 70 (mtHsp70), and translocase in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Tim)15. Tim15 is also known as zinc finger motif (Zim)17 or mtHsp70 escort protein (Hep)1. Tim15 contains a zinc-finger motif (CXXC and CXXC) of ~100 residues, which has been named DNL after a short C-terminal motif of D(N/H)L [[cite:PUB00017068], [cite:PUB00055517], [cite:PUB00047324]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR20922" "DNL-TYPE ZINC FINGER PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitochondrial import protein TIM15", "short" "Mt_import_TIM15"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2353, "taxa" 8052, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4649, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4649, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3062}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024158", :literature {"PUB00047324" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Momose T" "Ohshima C" "Maeda M" "Endo T."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO Rep.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7400990", "medline_journal" "EMBO Rep", "title" "Structural basis of functional cooperation of Tim15/Zim17 with yeast mitochondrial Hsp70.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "664-70", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17571076}, "PUB00017068" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["Burri L" "Vascotto K" "Fredersdorf S" "Tiedt R" "Hall MN" "Lithgow T."], "ISO_journal" "J.
