{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The calcium sensing receptor (CAS) from Arabidopsis is a thylakoid-localised phosphoprotein that possesses a single transmembrane domain that splits the protein into two halves: the N-terminal domain which binds Ca2 with low affinity and high capacity, and the C-terminal domain that contains a non-catalytic rhodanese homology domain and phosphorylation sites [[cite:PUB00096846]]. It modulates cytoplasmic Ca2 levels and it is required for proper stomatal regulation in response to elevated levels of external Ca2 [[cite:PUB00096848]] and it is also involved in de-etiolation [[cite:PUB00096847]]. This protein also plays a role in the STN7/STN8/TAP38 network of phosphorylation-mediated photoacclimation processes in Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00096846]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8tfs", "name" "Crystal structure of the Rhodanese-like domain of Vretifemale_1082 from Volvox reticuliferus"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34209" "RHODANESE/CELL CYCLE CONTROL PHOSPHATASE SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Calcium sensing receptor, plant", "short" "CAS_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 286, "taxa" 1197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1265, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1265, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 775}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044690", :literature {"PUB00096846" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Cutolo E" "Parvin N" "Ruge H" "Pirayesh N" "Roustan V" "Weckwerth W" "Teige M" "Grieco M" "Larosa V" "Vothknecht UC."], "ISO_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Front Plant Sci", "title" "The High Light Response in Arabidopsis Requires the Calcium Sensor Protein CAS, a Target of STN7- and STN8-Mediated Phosphorylation.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "974", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31417591}, "PUB00096847" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Huang SS" "Chen J" "Dong XJ" "Patton J" "Pei ZM" "Zheng HL."], "ISO_journal" "Physiol Plant", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Physiol Plant", "title" "Calcium and calcium receptor CAS promote Arabidopsis thaliana de-etiolation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "73-82", "volume" "144", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21919914}, "PUB00096848" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Wang WH" "Yi XQ" "Han AD" "Liu TW" "Chen J" "Wu FH" "Dong XJ" "He JX" "Pei ZM" "Zheng HL."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "Calcium-sensing receptor regulates stomatal closure through hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide in response to extracellular calcium in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "177-90", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21940718}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0009704", "name" "de-etiolation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0071277", "name" "cellular response to calcium ion", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0090333", "name" "regulation of stomatal closure", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044690", "name" "Calcium sensing receptor, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
