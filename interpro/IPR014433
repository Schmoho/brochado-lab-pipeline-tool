{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CO dehydrogenase), as well as other nickel metalloenzymes, it is synthesized as a precursor that is devoid of the metalloenzyme active site. These precursors undergo a complex post-translational maturation process that requires a number of accessory proteins [[cite:PUB00014601], [cite:PUB00027788], [cite:PUB00013569]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this entry are accessory proteins involved in maturation of metalloenzymes. Specifically, CooC participates in the incorporation of nickel into the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase metallocentre [[cite:PUB00027788]]. CooC also catalyses the hydrolysis of ATP and GTP [[cite:PUB00027766]]. Members contain a P-loop nucleotide-binding motif at the N terminus that is essential for their function in both ATP hydrolysis and nickel insertion [[cite:PUB00027766]]. AcsF is thought to play a similar role in the maturation of the bifunctional enzyme acetyl-coenzyme A synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase in Moorella thermoacetica [[cite:PUB00027728]], and its counterparts are known in other organisms with this bifunctional enzyme, for example in Methanosarcina thermophila [[cite:PUB00017398]]. AcsF from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (AcsFCh) was shown to act as a maturation factor of Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) [[cite:PUB00158991]]. It catalyses the nickel and MgATP-dependent activation of ACS by forming a complex with apoACS that binds two nickel ions with higher affinity [[cite:PUB00158991]].</p>\n\n<p>Members of this group contain the CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA nucleotide-binding domain, typical of ATP-dependent amidoligases [[cite:PUB00015238]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3kjh", "name" "Zn-bound state of CooC1"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF005647" "Nickel insertion ATPase/GTPase (CO dehydrogenase maturation factor), CooC type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nickel insertion ATPase/GTPase (CO dehydrogenase maturation factor), CooC type", "short" "CooC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 391, "taxa" 2989, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6069, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6066, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4866}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014433", :literature {"PUB00014601" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Maroney MJ."], "ISO_journal" nil, "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1367-5931(99)80032-5", "medline_journal" "Curr Opin Chem Biol", "title" "Structure/function relationships in nickel metallobiochemistry.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "188-99", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10226043}, "PUB00027788" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Kerby RL" "Ludden PW" "Roberts GP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
