{:metadata {:description [{"text" "Members of this family are nucleoid-associated dsDNA-binding proteins called integration host factor (mIHF in mycobacteria ([swissprot:P71658]) and sIHF in streptomycetes) because of similarities in cellular role, not in sequence, to the integration host factor proteins of Escherichia coli. Actinobacterial-type IHF actually shows more sequence similarity to 30S ribosomal subunit protein S13 [[cite:PUB00065099], [cite:PUB00106273]]. Some members are fused to an additional guanylate kinase domain. mIHF is essential for survival of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its NMR spectroscopy revealed mIHF as a globular protein with a protruding Î±-helix and a disordered N-terminal similar to sHIF [[cite:PUB00151045], [cite:PUB00151044]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6bek", "name" "Structure of sIHF bound to an 8bp palindromic DNA"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041260" "integration host factor, actinobacterial type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Integration host factor, actinobacterial-type", "short" "IHF_actinobact"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1871, "taxa" 5482, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6099, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6099, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4827}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047806", :literature {"PUB00151044" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Nanji T" "Gehrke EJ" "Shen Y" "Gloyd M" "Zhang X" "Firby CD" "Huynh A" "Razi A" "Ortega J" "Elliot MA" "Guarne A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj", "title" "Streptomyces IHF uses multiple interfaces to bind DNA.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "129405", "volume" "1863", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31376411}, "PUB00151045" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Odermatt NT" "Lelli M" "Herrmann T" "Abriata LA" "Japaridze A" "Voilquin H" "Singh R" "Piton J" "Emsley L" "Dietler G" "Cole ST."], "ISO_journal" "J Struct Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Struct Biol", "title" "Structural and DNA binding properties of mycobacterial integration host factor mIHF.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "107434", "volume" "209", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31846718}, "PUB00106273" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Mishra A" "Vij M" "Kumar D" "Taneja V" "Mondal AK" "Bothra A" "Rao V" "Ganguli M" "Taneja B."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "Integration host factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mIHF, compacts DNA by a bending mechanism.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "e69985", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23922883}, "PUB00065099" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Swiercz JP" "Nanji T" "Gloyd M" "Guarne A" "Elliot MA."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "A novel nucleoid-associated protein specific to the actinobacteria.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23427309}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047806", "name" "Integration host factor, actinobacterial-type", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
