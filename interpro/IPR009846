{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several eukaryotic splicing factor 3B subunit 5 (SF3b5) proteins. SF3b5 is a 10kDa subunit of the splicing factor SF3b. SF3b associates with the splicing factor SF3a and a 12S RNA unit to form the  U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins complex. SF3b5 and SF3b14b are also thought to facilitate the interaction of U2 with the branch site [[cite:PUB00013034]]. Also included in this entry is RDS3 complex subunit 10, another protein involved in mRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00042559]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07189" "Splicing factor 3B subunit 10 (SF3b10)"}, "panther" {"PTHR20978" "SPLICING FACTOR 3B SUBUNIT 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Splicing factor 3B subunit 5/RDS3 complex subunit 10", "short" "SF3b5/RDS3-10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 65, "domain_architectures" 58, "proteomes" 2314, "taxa" 7963, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3532, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3527, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2371}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009846", :literature {"PUB00013034" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Will CL" "Urlaub H" "Achsel T" "Gentzel M" "Wilm M" "Luhrmann R."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdf480", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Characterization of novel SF3b and 17S U2 snRNP proteins, including a human Prp5p homologue and an SF3b DEAD-box protein.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "4978-88", "volume" "21", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12234937}, "PUB00042559" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Dziembowski A" "Ventura AP" "Rutz B" "Caspary F" "Faux C" "Halgand F" "Laprevote O" "Seraphin B."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600482", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Proteomic analysis identifies a new complex required for nuclear pre-mRNA retention and splicing.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "4847-56", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15565172}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009846", "name" "Splicing factor 3B subunit 5/RDS3 complex subunit 10", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR017089", "name" "Splicing factor 3B, subunit 5", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 67, "alignment:full" 2116}}}
