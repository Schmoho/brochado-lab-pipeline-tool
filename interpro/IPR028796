{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 8 (TTC8, also known as BBS8) is part of the BBSome complex (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8/TTC8, BBS9 and BBIP10), which is thought to function as a coat complex required for sorting of specific membrane proteins to the primary cilia [[cite:PUB00060532]]. The ciliary trafficking function of the BBSome is regulated by LZTFL1 (Leucine-zipper transcription factor-like 1) [[cite:PUB00069264]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primary cilia are ubiquitous cellular appendages that provide important sensory and signalling functions and their dysfunction underlies numerous human genetic disorders. The proteins disrupted in the human ciliary disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are required for the localisation of G protein-coupled receptors to primary cilia on central neurons. The alteration of signalling caused by mislocalisation of ciliary signalling proteins underlies the BBS phenotype [[cite:PUB00043592]]. BBS8 is one of the genes involved in BBS. A splice-site mutation in TTC8/BBS8 is also known to cause nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [[cite:PUB00069312]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011990", "name" "Tetratricopeptide-like helical domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44177" "TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT PROTEIN 8"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 8", "short" "BBS8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1096, "taxa" 4639, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2779, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2779, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1876}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR028796", :literature {"PUB00069312" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Riazuddin SA" "Iqbal M" "Wang Y" "Masuda T" "Chen Y" "Bowne S" "Sullivan LS" "Waseem NH" "Bhattacharya S" "Daiger SP" "Zhang K" "Khan SN" "Riazuddin S" "Hejtmancik JF" "Sieving PA" "Zack DJ" "Katsanis N."], "ISO_journal" "Am.
