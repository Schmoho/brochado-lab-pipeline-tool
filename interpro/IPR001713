The most abundant source of stefin A is poly-morphonuclear leucocytes from the liver, but it is also found in extracts of squamous epithelia from the mouth and oesophagus, and has been localised to the cytoplasm of the strata corneum and granulosum of the epidermis. The selective distribution of the inhibitor correlates with tissues that constitute a 'first line of defence' against pathogenic organisms. Stefin A may thus provide a protective function as an inhibitor of cysteine proteases utilised as invasive tools by many infectious agents [[cite:PUB00003345]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure of stefin A contains a 5-stranded anti-parallel Î²-sheet, wrapped around a central helix.
