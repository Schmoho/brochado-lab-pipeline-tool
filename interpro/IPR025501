In Escherichia coli, the cell division site is determined by the cooperative activity of min operon products MinC, MinD, and MinE [[cite:PUB00014907]]. MinD is a membrane-associated ATPase and is a septum site-determining factor through the activation and regulation of MinC and MinE. MinD is also known to undergo a rapid pole-to-pole oscillation movement in vivo as observed by fluorescent microscopy. In plants, chloroplast division requires the dimerisation of stromal MinD [[cite:PUB00014908]].
