{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Coenzyme F420 is a hydride carrier cofactor that plays important roles in primary and secondary metabolism in a range of bacteria and archaea [[cite:PUB00093753]]. This entry represents CofC family, guanylyltransferases involved in coenzyme F420 biosynthesis. CofC has been shown to catalyse the activation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as enolpyruvoyl-2-diphospho-5'-guanosine, via the condensation of PEP with GTP [[cite:PUB00045885]]. This family also includes 3-phospho-D-glycerate guanylyltransferase which catalyses the activation of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) as 3-[glyceryl]-diphospho-5'-guanosine, via the condensation of 3PG with GTP.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6bwg", "name" "Crystal structure of native Rv2983 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029044", "name" "Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR40392" "2-PHOSPHO-L-LACTATE GUANYLYLTRANSFERASE"}, "hamap" {"MF_02114" "2-phospho-L-lactate guanylyltransferase [cofC]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR03552" "2-phospho-L-lactate guanylyltransferase"}, "pfam" {"PF01983" "Guanylyl transferase CofC like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoenolpyruvate guanylyltransferase CofC", "short" "CofC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 19, "proteomes" 1842, "taxa" 6704, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7861, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7855, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5993}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0791", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0791"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
