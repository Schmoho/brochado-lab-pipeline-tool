{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) ([ec:1.1.99.8]), found in Gram-negative bacteria, is a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-containing enzyme which oxidises methanol to formaldehyde.  It is located in the periplasmic space and passes electrons derived from the oxidation of methanol to the soluble cytochrome cL [[cite:PUB00035561]]. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of two large alpha subunits and two smaller beta subunits. The alpha subunit binds the PQQ cofactor and contains the active site, while the function of the beta subunit is currently unknown [[cite:PUB00025506]]. The alpha subunit forms an eight-bladed propeller structure, with several novel tryptophan-docking motifs linking the individual blades together.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the beta subunit of methanol dehydrogenase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ad6", "name" "crystal structure of methanol dehydrogenase from M.
