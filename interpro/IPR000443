{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (also known as diabetes-associated peptide or amylin) is a pancreatic islet hormone that is stored with insulin in beta cell granules [[cite:PUB00000189]]. IAPP has a propensity to form islet cell-disrupting amyloid deposits, and opposes the action of insulin in peripheral tissues; the peptide may therefore have a significant role in the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus [[cite:PUB00000189]]. It is thought that an intrinsic structural motif of IAPP, which only occurs in species that develop age-associated or Type 2 diabetes (e.g., Homo sapiens (Human) and Felis silvestris catus (Cat)), is linked to its amyloidogenicity [[cite:PUB00000189]]. IAPP is a short, 37-residue peptide. The hormone selectively inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose utilisation and glycogen deposition in muscle, but does not affect adipocyte glucose metabolism. The sequences of amylin and the calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) show strong similarity: both peptides have a conserved N-terminal intramolecular disulphide bridge, and both have a C-terminal glycine, which suggests that the C-terminal residue of amylin, like that of CGRP, is amidated [[cite:PUB00004696]]. Near- and far-UV CD spectra of human alpha CGRP, analogues and fragments of CGRP, and amylin have been recorded in aqueous solution and in trifluoro- ethanol/water mixtures [[cite:PUB00000497]]. The peptides were shown to contain significant amounts of Î±-helix in aqueous solution, this amount increasing upon addition of TFE. Amylin appears to contain less helix than CGRP [[cite:PUB00000497]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8f0k", "name" "Human Amylin3 Receptor in complex with Gs and Pramlintide analogue peptide San385"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00818" "ISLETAMYLOID"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Islet amyloid polypeptide", "short" "IAPP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 41, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 539, "taxa" 1885, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2646, "sets" 0, "proteins" 687, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 508}, "pathways" 8}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000443", :literature {"PUB00000189" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Jordan K" "Murtaugh MP" "O'Brien TD" "Westermark P" "Betsholtz C" "Johnson KH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
