{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bacterial mRNAs often contain leader sequences that respond to specific metabolites or ions by altering expression of the associated downstream protein-coding sequences. This entry represents mgtA leader peptide (mgtL), which controls transcription elongation into the mgtA coding region in response to changes in cytosolic proline levels. When the levels of proline are low, this protein is not able to be translated and stem loop'C' forms in the mgtA 5' UTR which enables the transcription of the downstream mgtA gene [[cite:PUB00075831]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17059" "MgtA leader peptide"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "MgtA leader peptide", "short" "MGTL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 6, "taxa" 300, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 339, "sets" 0, "proteins" 339, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 295}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031434", :literature {"PUB00075831" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Park SY" "Cromie MJ" "Lee EJ" "Groisman EA."], "ISO_journal" "Cell", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.046", "medline_journal" "Cell", "title" "A bacterial mRNA leader that employs different mechanisms to sense disparate intracellular signals.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "737-48", "volume" "142", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20813261}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031434", "name" "MgtA leader peptide", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 7}}}
