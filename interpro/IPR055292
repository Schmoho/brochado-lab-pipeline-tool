{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Mitogen-activated protein kinase-binding protein 1 (MAPKBP1, also known as JNKBP1) and related proteins. Members of this family contain two WD40 domains at the N-terminal that mediate interaction with NOD2, leading to the down-regulation of NOD2-induced signalling pathways [[cite:PUB00155315]]. These proteins inhibit the activation of NF-kappa-B, a key transcription factor in inflammatory responses, and reduce the secretion of IL8, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. These proteins are also involved in the JNK signaling pathway, which is associated with various cellular processes including stress responses, apoptosis, and immune responses [[cite:PUB00155314]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44813" "MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-BINDING PROTEIN 1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mitogen-activated protein kinase-binding protein 1", "short" "MABP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 632, "taxa" 2349, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2090, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2090, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 470}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055292", :literature {"PUB00155314" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Koyano S" "Ito M" "Takamatsu N" "Shiba T" "Yamamoto K" "Yoshioka K."], "ISO_journal" "FEBS Lett", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01084-4", "medline_journal" "FEBS Lett", "title" "A novel Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-binding protein that enhances the activation of JNK by MEK kinase 1 and TGF-beta-activated kinase 1.", "year" 1999, "raw_pages" "385-8", "volume" "457", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10471813}, "PUB00155315" {"URL" nil, "issue" "35", "authors" ["Lecat A" "Di Valentin E" "Somja J" "Jourdan S" "Fillet M" "Kufer TA" "Habraken Y" "Sadzot C" "Louis E" "Delvenne P" "Piette J" "Legrand-Poels S."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M112.355545", "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-binding protein (JNKBP1) acts as a negative regulator of NOD2 protein signaling by inhibiting its oligomerization process.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "29213-26", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22700971}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055292", "name" "Mitogen-activated protein kinase-binding protein 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
