{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many bacterial pathogens deliver effector proteins into host cells via a type III secretion system. These effector proteins then alter the host cell's biology in ways that are advantageous to the pathogen. The NleG protein and its homologues form the largest family of effector proteins in the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli  O157:H7, with 14 members identified in the Sakai strain alone [[cite:PUB00056590]]. NleG family members share a conserved C-terminal domain that forms a structure similar to the RING finger/U-box domain found in eukaryotic ubiquitin ligases [[cite:PUB00056591]]. They selectively interact with human E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and exhibit in vitro activity typical of eukaryotic E3 ligases, though the role of this activity in pathogenesis is not yet known.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038436", "name" "Effector protein NleG superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06416" "Effector protein NleG"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Effector protein NleG", "short" "Effector_NleG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 160, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 668, "sets" 0, "proteins" 668, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 452}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010489", :literature {"PUB00056590" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Tobe T" "Beatson SA" "Taniguchi H" "Abe H" "Bailey CM" "Fivian A" "Younis R" "Matthews S" "Marches O" "Frankel G" "Hayashi T" "Pallen MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
