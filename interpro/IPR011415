{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group contains two-domain proteins that are fusions of spore maturation protein A (SpmA) and spore maturation protein B (SpmB). SpmA and SpmB are thought to be involved in spore core dehydration in Bacillus subtilis. Spore dehydration is important for heat resistance, and for processing the spore germination protease GPR into an active form [[cite:PUB00014645]]. SpmA and SpmB might be involved in import or export from the forespore, or for modification of the cortex peptidoglycan structure [[cite:PUB00009933]]. SpmA and SpmB are predicted to be integral membrane proteins.</p>\r\n\r\nFor additional information please see [[cite:PUB00014609]].", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF036542" "Predicted bifunctional spore maturation protein, fused SpmA/SpmB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Predicted bifunctional spore maturation protein, fused SpmA/SpmB", "short" "SpmA_SpmB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 978, "taxa" 4324, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5022, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4552, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3556}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR011415", :literature {"PUB00014645" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Illades-Aguiar B" "Setlow P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
