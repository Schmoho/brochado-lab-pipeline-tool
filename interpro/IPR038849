{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) mediate cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in immune responses. ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2-binding protein, also known as BART, plays an essential role in the nuclear retention of STAT3 through interaction with GTPase ARL2 (ARF-like 2) [[cite:PUB00088488]]. BART is predominantly cytosolic but can also be found to be associated with mitochondria. BART is also involved in binding to the adenine nucleotide transporter ANT1 and may have a role in mitochondria transport and/or apoptosis [[cite:PUB00053517]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042541", "name" "BART domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15487" "ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 2-BINDING PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2-binding protein", "short" "ARL2BP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 909, "taxa" 3674, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1723, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1723, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1170}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR038849", :literature {"PUB00088488" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Muromoto R" "Sekine Y" "Imoto S" "Ikeda O" "Okayama T" "Sato N" "Matsuda T."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
