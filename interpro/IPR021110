{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Genome duplication is precisely regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases CDKs, which bring about the onset of S phase by activating replication origins and then prevent relicensing of origins until mitosis is completed. The optimum sequence motif for CDK phosphorylation is S/T-P-K/R-K/R, and Drc1-Sld2 is found to have at least 11 potential phosphorylation sites. Drc1 is required for DNA synthesis and S-M replication checkpoint control. Drc1 associates with Cdc2 and is phosphorylated at the onset of S phase when Cdc2 is activated. Thus Cdc2 promotes DNA replication by phosphorylating Drc1 and regulating its association with Cut5 [[cite:PUB00053358]]. Sld2 and Sld3 represent the minimal set of S-CDK substrates required for DNA replication [[cite:PUB00053359]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes ATP-dependent DNA helicase Q4, which may be involved in chromosome segregation and has been associated with various diseases [[cite:PUB00099810], [cite:PUB00099811]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11719" "DNA replication and checkpoint protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA replication/checkpoint protein", "short" "DNA_rep_checkpnt_protein"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 47, "proteomes" 1318, "taxa" 4540, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2100, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2045, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1117}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
