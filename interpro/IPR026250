{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) is a large, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that is a key regulator of intracellular Ca(2+) signalling [[cite:PUB00056602]]. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is formed in response to the activation of G protein-coupled receptors or tyrosine kinase receptors located in the plasma membrane, which elicit IP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) release from ER stores [[cite:PUB00056602]].</p>\n\n<p>The IP(3)R contains an N-terminal IP(3) recognition site and a C-terminal Ca(2+)-channel domain; between them is a large interaction domain for regulatory proteins, including calmodulin, chromgranins, glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase, RACK1 and caldendrin [[cite:PUB00056602]]. These proteins regulate IP(3)R in diverse ways, but only two regulators have been shown to influence Ca(2+) sensitivity [[cite:PUB00056602]].</p>\n\n<p>A protein termed DANGER has been identified as a novel IP(3)R-interacting protein [[cite:PUB00056602]]. DANGER is membrane-associated and predicted to contain a partial MAB-21 domain. It is expressed in a wide variety of neuronal cell lineages, where it localises with IP(3)R to membranes in the cell periphery. DANGER interacts with IP(3)R in vitro and co-immuno- precipitates with IP(3)R from cellular preparations; it robustly enhances Ca(2+)-mediated inhibition of IP(3)R Ca(2+) release without affecting IP(3) binding in microsomal assays, and inhibits gating in single-channel recordings of IP(3)R. The protein appears to allosterically modulate the sensitivity of IP(3)R to Ca(2+) inhibition, which probably alters IP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) dynamics in cells where DANGER and IP(3)R are co-expressed [[cite:PUB00056602]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02107" "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-interacting protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-interacting protein-like", "short" "ITPRIP-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 627, "taxa" 2120, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14177, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2792, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2101}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR026250", :literature {"PUB00056602" {"URL" nil, "issue" "48", "authors" ["van Rossum DB" "Patterson RL" "Cheung KH" "Barrow RK" "Syrovatkina V" "Gessell GS" "Burkholder SG" "Watkins DN" "Foskett JK" "Snyder SH."], "ISO_journal" "J.
