Coenzyme F430 is an ancillary factor for methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that mediates methane biogenesis in methanogens. CfbD catalyzes both the six-electron reduction of the tetrahydroporphyrin ring system and the gamma-lactamization of the c-acetamide side chain of Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide, to produce the last intermediate in F430 biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00087319]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03282" "Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide reductive cyclase catalytic subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide reductive cyclase complex, component CfbD", "short" "CfbD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 76, "taxa" 581, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 525, "sets" 0, "proteins" 525, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 461}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0722"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
