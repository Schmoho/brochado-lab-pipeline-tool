{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins that includes Putative autolysin regulatory protein ArpU. ArpU was originally described as a regulator of cellular muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae [[cite:PUB00099979]], but appears to have been cloned from a prophage. This family appears related to the RinA family of bacteriophage transcriptional activators and to some sporulation-specific sigma factors, and it is proposed to be a phage transcriptional activator family. Members of this protein family are found in tailed bacteriophages (Caudovirales) and in Bacilli [[cite:PUB00099978]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01637" "ArpU family phage packaging/lysis transcriptional regulator"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative autolysin regulatory protein ArpU-like", "short" "ArpU-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 479, "taxa" 1874, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2815, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2815, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1517}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006524", :literature {"PUB00099978" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Ferrer MD" "Quiles-Puchalt N" "Harwich MD" "Tormo-Mas MA" "Campoy S" "Barbe J" "Lasa I" "Novick RP" "Christie GE" "Penades JR."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "RinA controls phage-mediated packaging and transfer of virulence genes in Gram-positive bacteria.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "5866-78", "volume" "39", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21450808}, "PUB00099979" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Lleo MM" "Fontana R" "Solioz M."], "ISO_journal" "J Bacteriol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Bacteriol", "title" "Identification of a gene (arpU) controlling muramidase-2 export in Enterococcus hirae.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "5912-7", "volume" "177", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7592343}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR006524", "name" "Putative autolysin regulatory protein ArpU-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
