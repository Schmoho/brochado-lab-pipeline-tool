{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are fimbrial shaft proteins (major subunit proteins), found in the Bacteroidales. This family is named for Mfa1 from Porphyromonas gingivalis [[cite:PUB00085075], [cite:PUB00055568], [cite:PUB00080709]], and is related to but distinct from the family of FimA from this species.</p>\n\n<p>Five genes encoded by the mfa1 gene cluster form the Mfa1 fimbriae. Mfa1 constitutes the shaft, Mfa2 the anchor, and Mfa3-5 are the tip proteins of the fimbria. Mfa1, Mfa2 and Mfa3 have the same overall fold that consists of two β-sandwich domains. Upon polymerisation, the first β-strand of the shaft or tip protein is removed by indigenous proteases. The resulting void is filled by a donor-strand from another fimbrial protein [[cite:PUB00105536]].</p>\n\n<p>The Mfa1 shaft protein has several distinct structural features not observed in the anchor and tip proteins and these are a metal-binding proline-rich loop and a large 63 residue long insert in the C-terminal domain. The exposed prolines on Mfa1 are likely to interact with surface proteins of other bacteria [[cite:PUB00105536]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5nf3", "name" "The fimbrial shaft protein Mfa1 from Porphyromonas gingivalis-C-terminal deletion"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF038041" "Mfa1 family fimbria major subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fimbria major subunit Mfa1", "short" "Mfa1_fim"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 76, "taxa" 411, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1175, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1175, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 913}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047786", :literature {"PUB00055568" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 10", "authors" ["Hasegawa Y" "Iwami J" "Sato K" "Park Y" "Nishikawa K" "Atsumi T" "Moriguchi K" "Murakami Y" "Lamont RJ" "Nakamura H" "Ohno N" "Yoshimura F."], "ISO_journal" "Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.028928-0", "medline_journal" "Microbiology", "title" "Anchoring and length regulation of Porphyromonas gingivalis Mfa1 fimbriae by the downstream gene product Mfa2.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "3333-47", "volume" "155", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19589838}, "PUB00080709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hasegawa Y" "Nagano K" "Ikai R" "Izumigawa M" "Yoshida Y" "Kitai N" "Lamont RJ" "Murakami Y" "Yoshimura F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Oral Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/omi.12040", "medline_journal" "Mol Oral Microbiol", "title" "Localization and function of the accessory protein Mfa3 in Porphyromonas gingivalis Mfa1 fimbriae.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "467-80", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24118823}, "PUB00105536" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Hall M" "Hasegawa Y" "Yoshimura F" "Persson K."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Structural and functional characterization of shaft, anchor, and tip proteins of the Mfa1 fimbria from the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "1793", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29379120}, "PUB00085075" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Nagano K" "Hasegawa Y" "Yoshida Y" "Yoshimura F."], "ISO_journal" "J.
