{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Beta-defensins are small cationic peptides that have triple-stranded β-sheet structure [[cite:PUB00085313]]. They are characterized by the presence of multiple cysteine residues (forming three distinctive intramolecular disulfide bridges) and a highly similar tertiary structure known as the defensin motif [[cite:PUB00085313]]. All beta-defensin genes encode a precursor peptide that consists of a hydrophobic, leucine-rich signal sequence, a pro-sequence, and a mature six-cysteine defensin motif at the carboxy terminus [[cite:PUB00085314]]. They exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and contribute to mucosal immune responses at epithelial sites [[cite:PUB00085315]]. Several beta-defensins family members have been shown to play essential roles in sperm maturation and fertility in rats, mice and humans [[cite:PUB00085315]]. In addition to the wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, mammalian beta-defensins have been reported to have other roles in the immune system, such as the chemotactic ability for immature dendritic cells and memory T-cells via chemokine receptor-6 demonstrated by human beta-defensin-2 [[cite:PUB00085316]].</p>\n\n<p>Defensin beta 136 exhibits antibacterial and antifungal activity [[cite:PUB00101075]]. It has high lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding affinity, and may thereby be involved in immunoregulation through LPS neutralization [[cite:PUB00101075]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17333" "Beta defensin 136"}, "panther" {"PTHR39413" "BETA-DEFENSIN 136"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Beta-defensin 136/42", "short" "DEFB136/42"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 89, "taxa" 338, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 118, "sets" 0, "proteins" 118, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 74}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035307", :literature {"PUB00085313" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Sugiarto H" "Yu PL."], "ISO_journal" "Int.
