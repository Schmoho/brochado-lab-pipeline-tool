{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acid phosphatase A catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction via a phosphoseryl intermediate to produce inorganic phosphate and the corresponding alcohol, optimally at low pH [[cite:PUB00040150]]. AcpA hydrolyzes a variety of substrates, including p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP), p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (pNPPC), peptides containing phosphotyrosine, inositol phosphates, AMP, ATP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, glucose and fructose 6-phosphates, NADP, and ribose 5-phosphate [[cite:PUB00040150]]. AcpA is distinct from histidine ACPs and purple ACPs, as well as class A, B, and C bacterial nonspecific ACPs [[cite:PUB00085720]]. This protein shares regions of sequence similarity with the phosphocholine-preferring phospholipase C enzymes ([interpro:IPR017767]) from many of the same species.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR017850", "name" "Alkaline-phosphatase-like, core domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03397" "acid phosphatase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acid phosphatase, AcpA", "short" "AcpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 293, "taxa" 1750, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2128, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2128, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1722}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017768", :literature {"PUB00040150" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Felts RL" "Reilly TJ" "Tanner JJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
