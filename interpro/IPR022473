Many species have several closely-related members of this family, probably with variable abilities to act additionally on related quaternary amines.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03415" "choline ABC transporter ATP-binding protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, Choline, ATP-binding subunit", "short" "ABC_trnsptr_Choline_ATP-bd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 727, "taxa" 2895, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2808, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2808, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2235}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0748", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0748"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022473", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0015220", "name" "choline transmembrane transporter activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0015871", "name" "choline transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0055052", "name" "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex, substrate-binding subunit-containing", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022473", "name" "ABC transporter, Choline, ATP-binding subunit", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
