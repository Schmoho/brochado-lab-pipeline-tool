{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of various uncharacterized phage proteins and a few bacterial proteins. The family members range in length from 82 to 229 amino acids, with most in the 180 to 200 amino acid range. They are found in phages that infect Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Rhodobacter, Sphingomonas, Achromobacter, and Burkholderia bacteria. Bacterial proteins in the family are from Candidatus Macondimonas diazotrophica, Verrucomicrobium sp. GAS474 and Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme. The function of these proteins is currently unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF23978" "Family of unknown function (DUF7303)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7303", "short" "DUF7303"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 28, "taxa" 197, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 94, "sets" 0, "proteins" 94, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055727", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055727", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7303", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 12, "alignment:full" 26}}}
