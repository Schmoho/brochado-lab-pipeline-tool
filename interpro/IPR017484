All are supported as kynurenine formamidase ([ec:3.5.1.9]) by an operon structure in which kynureninase and/or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase genes are adjacent. The members from Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia metallidurans (strain CH34) have been characterised. An example from Pseudomonas fluorescens is given the gene symbol qbsH instead of kynB because of its role in quinolobactin biosynthesis, which begins with tryptophan. All members of this family should be kynurenine formamidase ([ec:3.5.1.9]).</p>\r\n<p>Synonym(s): Arylformamidase, N-formylkynurenine formamidase</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4co9", "name" "Crystal structure of kynurenine formamidase from Bacillus anthracis"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037175", "name" "Kynurenine formamidase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03035" "arylformamidase"}, "hamap" {"MF_01969" "Kynurenine formamidase [kynB]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Kynurenine formamidase, bacteria", "short" "Kynurenine_formamidase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 641, "taxa" 2572, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2407, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2407, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1846}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0659", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0659"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
