{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes several O-glycosyltransferases from the afumC family. afumC from Aspergillus fumigatus is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis fumihopaside A, a hopane-type glucoside that enhances the thermotolerance and UV resistance [[cite:PUB00097904]]. PaGT from the yeast Phomopsis amygdali is important for the biosynthesis of the mycotoxins known as fusicoccins, diterpene glycosides which are potent activators of plasma membrane H+-ATPases in plants, leading to disease constriction canker [[cite:PUB00090984]]. Also included in this entry is the probable glycosyltransferase FCK3, which is part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of cytokinins such as fusatin, fusatinic acids or 8-oxofusatin, known for their growth promoting and anti-senescence activities toward host plants [[cite:PUB00097905]].</p>\n\n<p>These entry also includes several uncharacterised bacterial sequences annotated as capsular polysaccharide proteins, which in Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major virulence factors.
