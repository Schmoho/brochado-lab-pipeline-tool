{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents homologs of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit CcoM from the Cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase that was identified in Pseudomonas stutzeri (also known as Stutzerimonas stutzeri) strain ZoBell [[cite:PUB00151294]]. Biochemical studies suggest that CcoM may be involved in CcO complex assembly or stabilization. It may also play a role in anaerobic respiration, as the knockout strain displayed altered growth rates under anaerobic denitrifying conditions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041600" "cytochrome c oxidase subunit CcoM"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit CcoM-like", "short" "Cyt_ox_CcoM-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 75, "taxa" 471, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 422, "sets" 0, "proteins" 422, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 352}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048085", :literature {"PUB00151294" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kohlstaedt M" "Buschmann S" "Xie H" "Resemann A" "Warkentin E" "Langer JD" "Michel H."], "ISO_journal" "mBio", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "mBio", "title" "Identification and Characterization of the Novel Subunit CcoM in the cbb3‚ÇÉCytochrome c Oxidase from Pseudomonas stutzeri ZoBell.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e01921-15", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26814183}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048085", "name" "Cytochrome c oxidase subunit CcoM-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
