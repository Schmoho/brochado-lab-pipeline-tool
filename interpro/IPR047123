{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of proteins from vertebrates, including Myeloid-associated differentiation marker from human (MYADM). MYADM regulates cell spreading and migration, and membrane condensation. It also mediates Rac1 targeting to ordered membranes [[cite:PUB00101983]]. This protein regulates the connection between the plasma membrane and the cortical cytoskeleton, controlling the endothelial inflammatory response [[cite:PUB00101985]]. Its expression has been associated with asthma severity [[cite:PUB00101984]]. MYADM has been proposed as biomarker for non-small-cell lung cancer [[cite:PUB00101982]]. Members of this group of proteins show two tandem Marvel domains ([interpro:IPR008253]).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17068" "MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER MYADM FAMILY MEMBER"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Myeloid-associated differentiation marker-like", "short" "MYADM-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 629, "taxa" 2151, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2932, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2932, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1954}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR047123", :literature {"PUB00101982" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Zhou M" "Chen Y" "Gu X" "Wang C."], "ISO_journal" "Pathol Oncol Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Pathol Oncol Res", "title" "A Comprehensive Bioinformatic Analysis for Identification of Myeloid-Associated Differentiation Marker as a Potential Negative Prognostic Biomarker in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "1610504", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 36061144}, "PUB00101983" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Aranda JF" "Reglero-Real N" "Kremer L" "Marcos-Ramiro B" "Ruiz-Saenz A" "Calvo M" "Enrich C" "Correas I" "Millan J" "Alonso MA."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "MYADM regulates Rac1 targeting to ordered membranes required for cell spreading and migration.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "1252-62", "volume" "22", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21325632}, "PUB00101984" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Dy ABC" "Langlais PR" "Barker NK" "Addison KJ" "Tanyaratsrisakul S" "Boitano S" "Christenson SA" "Kraft M" "Meyers D" "Bleecker ER" "Li X" "Ledford JG."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "Myeloid-associated differentiation marker is a novel SP-A-associated transmembrane protein whose expression on airway epithelial cells correlates with asthma severity.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" "23392", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34862427}, "PUB00101985" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Aranda JF" "Reglero-Real N" "Marcos-Ramiro B" "Ruiz-Saenz A" "Fernandez-Martin L" "Bernabe-Rubio M" "Kremer L" "Ridley AJ" "Correas I" "Alonso MA" "Millan J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Cell", "title" "MYADM controls endothelial barrier function through ERM-dependent regulation of ICAM-1 expression.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "483-94", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23264465}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR047123", "name" "Myeloid-associated differentiation marker-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
