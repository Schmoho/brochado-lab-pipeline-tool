{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Riboflavin is converted into catalytically active cofactors (FAD and FMN) by the actions of riboflavin kinase ([ec:2.7.1.26]), which converts it into FMN, and FAD synthetase ([ec:2.7.7.2]), which adenylates FMN to FAD. Eukaryotes usually have two separate enzymes, while most prokaryotes have a single bifunctional protein that can carry out both catalyses, although exceptions occur in both cases. While eukaryotic monofunctional riboflavin kinase is orthologous to the bifunctional prokaryotic enzyme [[cite:PUB00030175]], the monofunctional FAD synthetase differs from its prokaryotic counterpart, and is instead related to the PAPS-reductase family [[cite:PUB00035657]]. The bacterial FAD synthetase that is part of the bifunctional enzyme has remote similarity to nucleotidyl transferases and, hence, it may be involved in the adenylylation reaction of FAD synthetases [[cite:PUB00010127]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the bacterial bifunctional form of riboflavin kinase.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1mrz", "name" "Crystal structure of a flavin binding protein from Thermotoga Maritima, TM379"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023465", "name" "Riboflavin kinase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF004491" "Riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibF/RibC types"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00083" "riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Riboflavin kinase, bacterial", "short" "Riboflavin_kinase_bac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8823, "taxa" 33265, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 39059, "sets" 0, "proteins" 38677, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 29352}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1734", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1734"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
