{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this entry consist of a Ras-associated (RA) domain, a PH domain, a family-specific BPS region, and a C-terminal SH2 domain. Grb7, Grb10 and Grb14 are paralogues that are also present in this entry [[cite:PUB00053055]]. These adapter proteins bind a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptors. Grb10 and Grb14 are important tissue-specific negative regulators of insulin and IGF1 signaling based and may contribute to type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes in humans. RA-PH function as a single structural unit and is dimerized via a helical extension of the PH domain. The PH domain here are proposed to bind phosphoinositides non-cannonically and are unlikely to bind an activated GTPase [[cite:PUB00080402]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3m7f", "name" "Crystal structure of the Nedd4 C2/Grb10 SH2 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11243" "GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR-BOUND PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GRB/APBB1IP", "short" "GRB/APBB1IP"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1017, "taxa" 4012, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8913, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8913, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5045}, "pathways" 61}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039664", :literature {"PUB00090210" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Lafuente EM" "van Puijenbroek AA" "Krause M" "Carman CV" "Freeman GJ" "Berezovskaya A" "Constantine E" "Springer TA" "Gertler FB" "Boussiotis VA."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
