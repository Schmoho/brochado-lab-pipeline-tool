{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Two-component signal transduction systems enable bacteria to sense, respond, and adapt to a wide range of environments, stressors, and growth conditions [[cite:PUB00042804]].  Some bacteria can contain up to as many as 200 two-component systems that need tight regulation to prevent unwanted cross-talk [[cite:PUB00042805]]. These pathways have been adapted to response to a wide variety of stimuli, including nutrients, cellular redox state, changes in osmolarity, quorum signals, antibiotics, and more [[cite:PUB00010651]]. Two-component systems are comprised of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR) [[cite:PUB00011096]]. The HK catalyses its own auto-phosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. Some HK are bifunctional, catalysing both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of their cognate RR. The input stimuli can regulate either the kinase or phosphatase activity of the bifunctional HK.</p>\r\n<p>A variant of the two-component system is the phospho-relay system. Here a hybrid HK auto-phosphorylates and then transfers the phosphoryl group to an internal receiver domain, rather than to a separate RR protein. The phosphoryl group is then shuttled to histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) and subsequently to a terminal RR, which can evoke the desired response [[cite:PUB00042806], [cite:PUB00042807]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents predicted response regulators with Fis-like DNA-binding domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016788" "Predicted response regulator with Fis-like DNA-binding domain"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fis-like DNA-binding domain-containing signal transduction response regulator, predicted", "short" "Sig_transdc_resp-reg_prd"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 37, "taxa" 290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 335, "sets" 0, "proteins" 335, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 284}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014483", :literature {"PUB00042804" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Skerker JM" "Prasol MS" "Perchuk BS" "Biondi EG" "Laub MT."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Biol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030334", "medline_journal" "PLoS Biol", "title" "Two-component signal transduction pathways regulating growth and cell cycle progression in a bacterium: a system-level analysis.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "e334", "volume" "3", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16176121}, "PUB00042805" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Laub MT" "Goulian M."], "ISO_journal" "Annu.
