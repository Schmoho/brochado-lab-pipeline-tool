{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This is a plant family of proteins which includes DWD HYPERSENSITIVE TO UV-B 1 protein (DHU1) from Arabidopsis. DHU1 may act as a substrate receptor of a CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (CRL4) complex involved in the negative regulation of cellular responses to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) illumination, likely in coordination with RUP1 [[cite:PUB00100505], [cite:PUB00100504]]. It interacts with COP1 and probably prevents the formation of active UVR8-COP1 complex, thus avoiding UVR8-COP1-mediated positive regulation of UV-B responses [[cite:PUB00100504]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47201" "BNAC09G30780D PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DWD HYPERSENSITIVE TO UV-B 1", "short" "DHU1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 242, "taxa" 1021, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 925, "sets" 0, "proteins" 925, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 541}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046377", :literature {"PUB00100504" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kim SH" "Kim H" "Chung S" "Lee JH."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "title" "DHU1 negatively regulates UV-B signaling via its direct interaction with COP1 and RUP1.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "285-290", "volume" "491", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28735869}, "PUB00100505" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Kim SH" "Kim H" "Seo KI" "Kim SH" "Chung S" "Huang X" "Yang P" "Deng XW" "Lee JH."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Mol Biol", "title" "DWD HYPERSENSITIVE TO UV-B 1 is negatively involved in UV-B mediated cellular responses in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "571-83", "volume" "86", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25193399}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0071493", "name" "cellular response to UV-B", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0080008", "name" "Cul4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046377", "name" "DWD HYPERSENSITIVE TO UV-B 1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
