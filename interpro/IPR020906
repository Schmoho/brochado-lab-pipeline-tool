{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cren7 is a chromatin protein found in Crenarchaeota and has a higher affinity for double-stranded DNA than for single-stranded DNA. The protein contains negative DNA supercoils and is associated with genomic DNA in vivo. Cren7 interacts with duplex DNA through a Î²-sheet and a long flexible loop. It is binding to double-stranded DNA without sequence specificity [[cite:PUB00097468]]. There is approximately 1 Cren7 molecule for 12 bp of DNA. The function of Cren7 has not been completely determined but it is thought that the protein may have a role similar to that of archaeal proteins in Euryarchaea [[cite:PUB00048078]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3kxt", "name" "Crystal structure of Sulfolobus Cren7-dsDNA complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038647", "name" "Cren7 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11520" "Chromatin protein Cren7"}, "hamap" {"MF_01387" "Chromatin protein Cren7 [creN7]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Double-stranded DNA-binding Cren7", "short" "dsDNA-bd_Cren7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 14, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 38, "taxa" 285, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 305, "sets" 0, "proteins" 305, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 286}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020906", :literature {"PUB00048078" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Guo L" "Feng Y" "Zhang Z" "Yao H" "Luo Y" "Wang J" "Huang L."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1128", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Biochemical and structural characterization of Cren7, a novel chromatin protein conserved among Crenarchaea.", "year" 2008, "raw_pages" "1129-37", "volume" "36", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 18096617}, "PUB00097468" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Feng Y" "Yao H" "Wang J."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Crystal structure of the crenarchaeal conserved chromatin protein Cren7 and double-stranded DNA complex.", "year" 2010, "raw_pages" "1253-7", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 20512977}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003690", "name" "double-stranded DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005737", "name" "cytoplasm", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR020906", "name" "Double-stranded DNA-binding Cren7", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 7, "alignment:full" 46}}}
