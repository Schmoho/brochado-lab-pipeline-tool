{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Pho85 is a non-essential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) involved in the cell cycle [[cite:PUB00073603]]. Pho85 is controlled by 10 cyclins that may be grouped into 2 families according to cyclin box sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00073602]]: the Pho80 family (Pho80, Pcl6, Pcl7, Pcl8, and Pcl10) and the Pcl1,2 family (Pcl1, Pcl2, Pcl5, Pcl9 and ClG1). Except Pcl5, the rest of the Plc1,2 family members show a tightly controlled cell cycle pattern of expression: Pcl9 is produced in late M phase and during early G1, Pcl2 in late M until late G1, and Pcl1 during late G1 [[cite:PUB00073602]].</p>\r\n<p>This entry includes Pcl1, Pcl2 and Pcl9.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF016511" "Cyclin, fungal Pcl/HCS26 type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PHO85 cyclin 1/2/9", "short" "PHO85_cyclin_1/2/9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 200, "taxa" 666, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 464, "sets" 0, "proteins" 447, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 316}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012104", :literature {"PUB00073603" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Jimenez J" "Ricco N" "Grijota-Martinez C" "Fado R" "Clotet J."], "ISO_journal" "Int J Biochem Mol Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Int J Biochem Mol Biol", "title" "Redundancy or specificity?
