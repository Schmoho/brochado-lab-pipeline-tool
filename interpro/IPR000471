{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Interferons [[cite:PUB00001107]] are proteins which produce antiviral and antiproliferative responses in cells.  On the basis of their sequence interferons are classified into five groups:  alpha, alpha-II (or omega), beta, delta (or trophoblast) and gamma.  Proteins in this entry are different from the interferon gamma family. The sequence differences may possibly cause different responses to various inducers, or result in the recognition of different target cell types [[cite:PUB00004593]]. All function as regulators of cellular activty by interacting with cell-surface receptors and activating various signalling pathways. Interferons produce antiviral and antiproliferative responses in cells. Receptor specificity determines function of the various members of the family [[cite:PUB00081575]].  The main conserved structural feature of interferons is a disulphide bond that, except in mouse beta interferon, occurs in all alpha, beta and omega sequences.\r\n\r\n<p>Type I interferons (alpha, beta) belong to the larger helical cytokine superfamily, which includes growth hormones, interleukins, several colony-stimulating factors and several other regulatory molecules.  This entry also includes also interferon omega and tau.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8irq", "name" "Larimichthys crocea IFNd"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009079", "name" "Four-helical cytokine-like, core", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00095" "IFab"}, "smart" {"SM00076" "Interferon alpha, beta and delta."}, "panther" {"PTHR11691" "TYPE I INTERFERON"}, "pfam" {"PF00143" "Interferon alpha/beta domain"}, "prosite" {"PS00252" "Interferon alpha, beta and delta family signature"}, "prints" {"PR00266" "INTERFERONAB"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Interferon alpha/beta/delta", "short" "Interferon_alpha/beta/delta"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 25, "domain_architectures" 12, "proteomes" 618, "taxa" 2322, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5933, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5847, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3951}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00225", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00225"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000471", :literature {"PUB00004593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Lawn RM" "Gross M" "Houck CM" "Franke AE" "Gray PV" "Goeddel DV."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
