{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This group represents an ionotropic glutamate-like receptor, plant type. They have sequence similarity with animal ionotropic glutamate receptor [[cite:PUB00096050], [cite:PUB00096051]]. Interestingly, despite sharing a common structure, GLRs and iGluRs display major sequence divergences, especially in key domains such as the receptor, the pore, and the 'gate'. Electrophysiological characterization of PpGLR1, AtGLR3.2, and AtGLR3.3 showed their ligand-independent activity, providing evidence for functional differences between iGluRs and at least these specific GLRs [[cite:PUB00096052]]. Animal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) functions in the nervous system. while plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) homologues are involved in many plant-specific physiological functions, such as sperm signaling in moss, pollen tube growth, root meristem proliferation, innate immune and wound responses [[cite:PUB00096052]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037090" "Ionotropic glutamate-like receptor, plant type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ionotropic glutamate receptor, plant", "short" "Iontropic_Glu_rcpt_pln"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 247, "taxa" 951, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8160, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6666, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3897}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017103", :literature {"PUB00096052" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Wudick MM" "Michard E" "Oliveira Nunes C" "Feijo JA."], "ISO_journal" "J Exp Bot", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Exp Bot", "title" "Comparing Plant and Animal Glutamate Receptors: Common Traits but Different Fates?", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" nil, "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29684179}, "PUB00096050" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Chiu JC" "Brenner ED" "DeSalle R" "Nitabach MN" "Holmes TC" "Coruzzi GM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Biol Evol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Biol Evol", "title" "Phylogenetic and expression analysis of the glutamate-receptor-like gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1066-82", "volume" "19", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12082126}, "PUB00096051" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5521", "authors" ["Lacombe B" "Becker D" "Hedrich R" "DeSalle R" "Hollmann M" "Kwak JM" "Schroeder JI" "Le Novere N" "Nam HG" "Spalding EP" "Tester M" "Turano FJ" "Chiu J" "Coruzzi G."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "The identity of plant glutamate receptors.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "1486-7", "volume" "292", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11379626}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR015683", "name" "Ionotropic glutamate receptor", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR001508", "name" "Ionotropic glutamate receptor, metazoa", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR017103", "name" "Ionotropic glutamate receptor, plant", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
