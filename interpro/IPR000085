{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>In prokaryotes, RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC process the universal DNA intermediate of homologous recombination, termed Holliday junction. The tetrameric DNA helicase RuvA, known as Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvA, specifically binds to the Holliday junction and facilitates the isomerization of the junction from the stacked folded configuration to the square-planar structure [[cite:PUB00013198]]. In the RuvA tetramer, each subunit consists of three domains, I, II and III, where I and II form the major core that is responsible for Holliday junction binding and base pair rearrangements of Holliday junction executed at the crossover point, whereas domain III regulates branch migration through direct contact with RuvB.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1cuk", "name" "ESCHERICHIA COLI RUVA PROTEIN AT PH 4.9 AND ROOM TEMPERATURE"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036267", "name" "RuvA, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00031" "Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvA [ruvA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00084" "Holliday junction branch migration protein RuvA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Holliday junction branch migration complex subunit RuvA", "short" "RuvA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 9121, "taxa" 36057, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41575, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41575, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31957}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0198", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0198"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000085", :literature {"PUB00013198" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Yamada K" "Miyata T" "Tsuchiya D" "Oyama T" "Fujiwara Y" "Ohnishi T" "Iwasaki H" "Shinagawa H" "Ariyoshi M" "Mayanagi K" "Morikawa K."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
