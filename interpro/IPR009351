{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family includes Uncharacterized protein YcaQ from Escherichia coli, AlkZ from Streptomyces sahachiroi (also known as Azi36), and similar proteins predominantly found in bacteria. YcaQ is a DNA glycosylase that protects cells against the toxicity of agents causing interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs), a toxic form of DNA damage [[cite:PUB00100683]]. The crystal structure of AlkZ revealed a C-shaped configuration with three tandem winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motifs and a positively charged surface that shows residues of great importance for the enzymatic activity [[cite:PUB00100682]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06224" "DNA glycosylase AlkZ-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA glycosylase AlkZ-like", "short" "AlkZ-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 55, "proteomes" 3722, "taxa" 14137, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 27650, "sets" 0, "proteins" 27504, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20961}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009351", :literature {"PUB00100683" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Bradley NP" "Washburn LA" "Christov PP" "Watanabe CMH" "Eichman BF."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Escherichia coli YcaQ is a DNA glycosylase that unhooks DNA interstrand crosslinks.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "7005-7017", "volume" "48", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32409837}, "PUB00100682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "17", "authors" ["Mullins EA" "Warren GM" "Bradley NP" "Eichman BF."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Structure of a DNA glycosylase that unhooks interstrand cross-links.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "4400-4405", "volume" "114", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28396405}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR009351", "name" "DNA glycosylase AlkZ-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 64, "alignment:full" 7946}}}
