{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Siderophores are low molecular weight iron-chelating compounds synthesised by many bacteria to aid in the aquisition of this vital trace element [[cite:PUB00028109]].  Proteins in this entry are adenylation components of non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores. These proteins belong to the AMP-binding family and are mostly thought to activate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) by ligation of AMP from ATP with the release of pyrophosphate (ATP-PPi exchange). Enzymatic studies on the purified enzyme, 2,3DHB-AMP ligase of Escherichia coli,  show that 2,3DHB  efficiently supports the ATP-PPi exchange while other analogues can replace 2,3DHB, for example: salicyclic acid (o-hydrobenzoate); 2,4DHB and 2,5DHB;  though the natural substrate 2,3DHB is by far the most efficient.  Substrates such as 2,6DHB and 2,4,6THB do not support the ATP-PPi exchange and suggest significant steric interference by the 6-hyroxy side chain [[cite:PUB00054028]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crystal structure of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase ([swissprot:P40871]) from Bacillus subtilis has been examined [[cite:PUB00022164]]. This protein is composed of a large N-terminal domain (~420 aa) and a more compact C-terminal domain (~110 aa), with an overall \"hammer-and-anvil\" fold similar to that of firefly luciferase [[cite:PUB00005277]]. The active site is located in a deep compartment located at the interface of the domains, with a p-loop thought to be involved in catalysis located at the entrance to the cavity. Relatively little conformational change was observed during catalysis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3o83", "name" "Structure of BasE N-terminal domain from Acinetobacter baumannii bound to 2-(4-n-dodecyl-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5'-O-[N-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02275" "(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate synthase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase", "short" "DHB_AMP_lig"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 402, "taxa" 2692, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3072, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3072, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2264}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
