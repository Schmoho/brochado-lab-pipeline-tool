{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of catechol O-methyltransferases found in eukaryotes. Catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT), along with several other enzymes, degrades catecholamines such as dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. It introduces a methyl group, donated by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the catecholamine. It is found in the postsynaptic neurons [[cite:PUB00044091]]. COMT inactivates catecholamines as well as catechol drugs such as L-DOPA. It is possible that the COMT gene is involved in neuropsychiatric conditions in which there are abnormalities in catecholamine neurotransmission, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [[cite:PUB00044092]]. An association between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and aggressive schizophrenia has been established.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5p9v", "name" "humanized rat COMT in complex with 8-hydroxy-6-(2-methylpyridin-3-yl)-3H-quinazolin-4-one"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF037177" "Catechol O-methyltransferase, eukaryotic type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Catechol O-methyltransferase, eukaryotic", "short" "Catechol_O-MeTrfase_euk"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 117, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 474, "taxa" 1619, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 692, "sets" 0, "proteins" 689, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 498}, "pathways" 20}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
