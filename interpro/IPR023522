{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Spore formation in Bacillus subtilis involves a highly asymmetric cell division where the chromosome destined to enter the spore needs to move to the extreme pole of the cell in order to be captured in the prespore cell. This is accomplished by a specialised that moves the oriC region of the chromosome close to the cell pole before septation. RacA, a DNA-binding protein, is part of this system and is required for proper chromosome separation [[cite:PUB00054276], [cite:PUB00054277]]. It binds in a dispersed manner throughout the chromosome but preferentially to sites clustered in the origin portion of the chromosome, causing condensation of the chromosome and its remodelling into an elongated, anchored structure.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01170" "Chromosome-anchoring protein RacA [racA]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Chromosome-anchoring protein RacA", "short" "Chrosome_anchoring_RacA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 125, "taxa" 521, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 582, "sets" 0, "proteins" 582, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 396}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR023522", :literature {"PUB00054276" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5606", "authors" ["Ben-Yehuda S" "Rudner DZ" "Losick R."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1079914", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "RacA, a bacterial protein that anchors chromosomes to the cell poles.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "532-6", "volume" "299", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12493822}, "PUB00054277" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Wu LJ" "Errington J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
