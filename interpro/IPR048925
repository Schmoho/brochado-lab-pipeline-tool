RdfA is required for the formation of rods under specific growth conditions, and is therefore involved in motility [[cite:PUB00153671]]. Protein members of this family possess four highly conserved cysteine residues at the C-terminal that could potentially be involved in zinc binding.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF21811" "Rod-determining factor A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rod-determining factor A", "short" "RdfA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 106, "taxa" 535, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 835, "sets" 0, "proteins" 835, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 728}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048925", :literature {"PUB00153671" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Schiller H" "Hong Y" "Kouassi J" "Rados T" "Kwak J" "DiLucido A" "Safer D" "Marchfelder A" "Pfeiffer F" "Bisson A" "Schulze S" "Pohlschroder M."], "ISO_journal" "Nat Commun", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45196-0", "medline_journal" "Nat Commun", "title" "Identification of structural and regulatory cell-shape determinants in Haloferax volcanii.", "year" 2024, "raw_pages" "1414", "volume" "15", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 38360755}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048925", "name" "Rod-determining factor A", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 94, "alignment:full" 201}}}
