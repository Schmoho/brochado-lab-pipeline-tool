{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins includes alpha/beta hydrolases from bacteria and fungi, involved in complex biosynthetic pathways for the production of secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities. Members of this family function as epimerases, esterases, and dehydrogenases, participating in the synthesis of compounds such as meroterpenoids and squalene-based molecules. Their activities include the modification of intermediate compounds through oxidation, reduction, methylation, and lactonization reactions, contributing to the structural diversity and bioactivity of the metabolites produced.</p>\n\n<p>Among its members is the probable hydrolase R7 catalyses key steps in the formation of structurally intricate products like novofumigatonin and squalestatin S1, which have potential pharmacological applications [[cite:PUB00094684]]. Alpha/beta hydrolase nvfD mediates the biosynthesis of novofumigatonin, a heavily oxygenated meroterpenoid containing a unique orthoester moiety [[cite:PUB00097861]]. Carbendazim hydrolyzing esterase, also included in this entry, catalyses the hydrolysis of the fungicide carbendazim (methyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate or MBC) to 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB) [[cite:PUB00155016]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6tj2", "name" "Extracellular alpha/beta-hydrolase from Paenibacillus species shares structural and functional homology to Tobacco Salicylic Acid Binding Protein 2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029058", "name" "Alpha/Beta hydrolase fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37017" "AB HYDROLASE-1 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Secondary metabolite biosynthesis hydrolase", "short" "Sec-Metab_Biosynth_Hydrolase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3300, "taxa" 11871, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 28084, "sets" 0, "proteins" 28084, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 20339}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
