{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of proteins mainly from proteobacteria, including Aldehyde oxidoreductase molybdenum-binding subunit PaoC from Escherichia coli (PaoC, [swissprot:P77489]), which oxidises aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acids with a preference for aromatic aldehydes. PaoC might play a role in the detoxification of aldehydes to avoid cell damage [[cite:PUB00153070]]. It forms part\n of the periplasmic aldehyde oxidoreductase PaoABC. The enzyme is known formally as carboxylate reductase ([ec:1.2.99.6]) [[cite:PUB00152936]]. The E.coli PaoABC complex structure was determined ([pdbe:5G5H]) in which PaoC was found to contain the Moco active site. Apparently, this is  the only known example of an E. coli Moco enzyme where cytosine is found in the dinucleotide form of the cofactor [[cite:PUB00152936]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5g5g", "name" "Escherichia coli Periplasmic Aldehyde Oxidase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037165", "name" "Aldehyde oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase, molybdopterin binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041671" "aldehyde oxidoreductase molybdenum-binding subunit PaoC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aldehyde oxidoreductase molybdenum-binding subunit PaoC-like", "short" "PaoC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 407, "taxa" 1839, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1839, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1839, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1472}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
