{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide which can be used as both a carbon source and an osmoprotectant in bacteria. Trehalose uptake into the cytoplasm occurs via a trehalose-specific phosphotransferase system which phosphorylates trehalase to trehalose-6-phosphate (Tre6P) during transport into the cytoplasm, and a hydrolase which hydrolyses Tre6P to glucose and glucose-6-phophate[[cite:PUB00033159]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry represents LacI-type TreR, a transcriptional repressor of trehalose uptake found mainly within the gamma-proteobacteria. It does not include the GntR-type TreR's such as those found in Bacillus species. It is capable of binding both the inducer Tre6P and trehalose. Binding of trehalose does not affect the repressor's affinity for its DNA binding site, while binding Tre6P substantially reduces its affinity. The repression activity of TreR is therefore regulated by the ratio of trehalose to Tre6P within the cell [[cite:PUB00033160]]. The protein is composed of two domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domain, and a C-terminal effector-binding domain which is homologous to that of LacI. The effector-binding domain is composed of two subdomains, both of which form an α-β-α sandwich, with the effector binding site located at the interface of these subdomains [[cite:PUB00023777]]. Tre6P and trehalose bind competitively to this site, with the affinity for trehalose substantially lower than that for Tre6P.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR028082", "name" "Periplasmic binding protein-like I", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02405" "trehalose operon repressor TreR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Trehalose operon repressor", "short" "Trehalos_R_gpbac"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 121, "taxa" 1258, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1513, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1513, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1143}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0271", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0271"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR012771", :literature {"PUB00033159" {"URL" nil, "issue" "18", "authors" ["Rimmele M" "Boos W."], "ISO_journal" "J.
