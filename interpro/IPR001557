In vertebrate muscles and in lactic acid bacteria it represents the final step in anaerobic glycolysis. This tetrameric enzyme is present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In vertebrates there are three isozymes of LDH: the M form (LDH-A), found predominantly in muscle tissues; the H form (LDH-B), found in heart muscle and the X form (LDH-C), found only in the spermatozoa of mammals and birds. In birds and crocodilian eye lenses, LDH-B serves as a structural protein and is known as epsilon-crystallin [[cite:PUB00004665]].</p>\n\n<p>L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase ([ec:1.1.1]) (L-hicDH) [[cite:PUB00001780]] catalyses the reversible and stereospecific interconversion between 2-ketocarboxylic acids and L-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids.
