Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue. Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches. The relationship between the two branches is not evident by (PSI-)BLAST but is clear from more sensitive sequence searches and structural comparisons [[cite:PUB00053493]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8e1j", "name" "Asp1 kinase in complex with 1,5-IP8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029033", "name" "Histidine phosphatase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12750" "DIPHOSPHOINOSITOL PENTAKISPHOSPHATE KINASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histidine acid phosphatase, VIP1 family", "short" "His_Pase_VIP1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2618, "taxa" 8826, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11498, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11498, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4744}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
