{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the DNA double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination protein XRCC4, which is found in certain Metazoans, fungi and plants. XRCC4 binds to DNA, and to DNA ligase IV (LIG4) to form the LIG4-XRCC4 complex [[cite:PUB00053426]]. The LIG4-XRCC4 complex is responsible for the ligation step in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. XRCC4 enhances the joining activity of LIG4. It is thought that XRCC4 and LIG4 are essential for alignment-based gap filling, as well as for final ligation of the breaks [[cite:PUB00012766]]. Binding of the LIG4-XRCC4 complex to DNA ends is dependent on the assembly of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex DNA-PK to these DNA ends.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009089", "name" "XRCC4, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28559" "DNA REPAIR PROTEIN XRCC4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA repair protein XRCC4", "short" "DNA_repair_prot_XRCC4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1125, "taxa" 4490, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2301, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2301, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1506}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010585", :literature {"PUB00012766" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Lee JW" "Yannone SM" "Chen DJ" "Povirk LF."], "ISO_journal" "Cancer Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/63/1/22", "medline_journal" "Cancer Res", "title" "Requirement for XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV in alignment-based gap filling for nonhomologous DNA end joining in vitro.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "22-4", "volume" "63", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12517771}, "PUB00053426" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["West CE" "Waterworth WM" "Jiang Q" "Bray CM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00856.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Arabidopsis DNA ligase IV is induced by gamma-irradiation and interacts with an Arabidopsis homologue of the double strand break repair protein XRCC4.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "67-78", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11029705}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006302", "name" "double-strand break repair", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006310", "name" "DNA recombination", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR010585", "name" "DNA repair protein XRCC4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
