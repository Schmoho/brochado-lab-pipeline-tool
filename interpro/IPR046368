{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This fungal family includes Tag1 (also known as YLR173W), a vacuolar membrane protein involved in termination of autophagy. It regulates autophagy termination during persistent nitrogen starvation through Atg1p-mediated re-phosphorylation of Atg13p and PAS disassembly [[cite:PUB00100170], [cite:PUB00100166]]. This is a type II membrane protein containing a hydrophobic transmembrane region, with the N-terminal region oriented toward the cytosol and the C-terminal inside the lumen, which is glycosylated. Tag1, together with Vac7 from yeast and TMEM106B from humans, has homology with LEA-2 domain. It has three tandemly repeated LEA-2 domains [[cite:PUB00100166]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35895" "CHROMOSOME 16, WHOLE GENOME SHOTGUN SEQUENCE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tag1", "short" "Tag1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1122, "taxa" 3056, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4559, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4559, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2507}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046368", :literature {"PUB00100166" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Levine TP."], "ISO_journal" "Proteins", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proteins", "title" "TMEM106B in humans and Vac7 and Tag1 in yeast are predicted to be lipid transfer proteins.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "164-175", "volume" "90", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 34347309}, "PUB00100170" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Kira S" "Noguchi M" "Araki Y" "Oikawa Y" "Yoshimori T" "Miyahara A" "Noda T."], "ISO_journal" "J Cell Sci", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Cell Sci", "title" "Vacuolar protein Tag1 and Atg1-Atg13 regulate autophagy termination during persistent starvation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.", "year" 2021, "raw_pages" nil, "volume" "134", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 33536246}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000329", "name" "fungal-type vacuole membrane", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046368", "name" "Tag1", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
