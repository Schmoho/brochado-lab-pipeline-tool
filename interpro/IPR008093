{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Antigen (Ag) recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR) induces activation of T lymphocytes. However, TCR-mediated signals alone are insufficient for efficient T cell activation, and additional co-stimulatory signals are required. One of the most important surface molecules that delivers co-stimulatory signals for T cells is CD28. The human T lymphocyte Ag CD28 (Tp44) is a homodimeric 90kDa glycoprotein expressed on the surface of the majority of human peripheral T cells and lymphocytes. Stimulation of CD4+ T cells in the absence of CD28 co-signalling causes impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production and altered generation of helper T cell subsets. Co-stimulation via CD28 promotes T cell viability, clonal expansion, cytokine production and effector functions, while also regulating apoptosis of activated T cells, suggesting its importance in regulating long-term T cell survival [[cite:PUB00010267], [cite:PUB00010266], [cite:PUB00010400], [cite:PUB00010399]].</p>\n\n<p>Ligands for CD28 and the structurally related CTLA-4 (CD152) are the molecules B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86). B7.1 and B7.2 are expressed on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) and their expression is up-regulated during an immune response. Ligation of CD28 by its natural ligands results in tyrosine phosphorylation at a YMNM motif within its cytoplasmic tail. The phosphorylated motif subsequently interacts with the Src homology 2 domain in the p85 regulatory subunit of P13K, activating the p110 catalytic subunit. One of the P13K-dependent downstream targets, resulting from the antibody cross-linking of CD28, is the phoshporylation and activation of Akt (or PKB). Constitutively active Akt is able to substitute for CD28 signals, and stimulates IL-2 production when introduced into mature CD28-deficient cells. Another molecule affected by CD28 stimulation is the proto-oncogene Vav, which acts as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac and CDC42, allowing these molecules to switch from the inactive GDP-bound state to the active GTP-bound state [[cite:PUB00010419], [cite:PUB00010414]].</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting feature of CD28, is its ability to induce expression of PDE7, a cAMP phosphodiesterase, thus reducing cellular cAMP levels. cAMP has been reported to affect nearly every pathway important for lymphocyte activation, leading to inhibition of T cell proliferation. Specifically, increased intracellular cAMP has been implicated in the induction of T cell anergy, a non-responsive state that occurs after T cells are stimulated through TCR/CD3 in the absence of co-stimulation. This can have therapeutic implications, in that blockage of CD28 co-stimulation can be profoundly immunosuppressive, preventing induction of pathogenic T cell responses in autoimmune disease models, and allowing for prolonged acceptance of allografts in models of organ transplantation [[cite:PUB00010414]].</p>\n\n<p>Finally, CD28 co-stimulation directly controls T cell cycle progression by down-regulating the cdk inhibitor p27kip1, which actually integrates mitogenic MEK and P13K-dependent signals from both TCR and CD28 [[cite:PUB00010419]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013783", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036179", "name" "Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01717" "CD28ANTIGEN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T cell antigen CD28", "short" "CD28"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 396, "taxa" 1283, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2100, "sets" 0, "proteins" 570, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 433}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008093", :literature {"PUB00010266" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Gross JA" "St John T" "Allison JP."], "ISO_journal" "J.
