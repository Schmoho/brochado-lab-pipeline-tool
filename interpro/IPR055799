{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a small family of uncharacterised proteins from pseudomonas phage. These proteins range in length from 114 and 130 amino acids. Structure prediction suggests the proteins adopt an open set of alpha helical segments as a monomer. However, homodimer prediction shows a confident interaction (iPTM 0.79). The dimer shows distinct charge distribution with a linear positively charged surface.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24090" "Family of unknown function (DUF7375)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7375", "short" "DUF7375"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 17, "taxa" 171, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 121, "sets" 0, "proteins" 121, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055799", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055799", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7375", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 5, "alignment:full" 24}}}
