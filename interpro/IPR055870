{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents an uncharacterized family found in various bacteriophage proteins. It is predominantly found in phages infecting diverse bacterial species including Burkholderia, Bacillus, Streptomyces, Listeria, and Caulobacter. The proteins are typically around 100-150 amino acids in length. Many of the proteins containing this domain are annotated as uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. The proteins form a compact domain composed of a four stranded antiparallel beta sheet.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24239" "Family of unknown function (DUF7447)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7447", "short" "DUF7447"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 18, "taxa" 293, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 158, "sets" 0, "proteins" 158, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 32}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055870", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055870", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF7447", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 20, "alignment:full" 31}}}
