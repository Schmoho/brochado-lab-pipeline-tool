{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This protein family is predominantly found in animals and bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Phosphorylase kinase (PHK) is a hexadecameric enzyme complex consisting of four copies each of four different subunits: alpha, beta, delta and gamma [[cite:PUB00098856], [cite:PUB00098854], [cite:PUB00098855]] that plays a role in glycogen metabolism. During activation of glycogenolysis, this protein complex phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP). The gamma subunit is the catalytic protein kinase, while alpha, beta and delta subunits control its activity. This entry represents several phosphorylase kinase regulatory alpha and beta subunits (KPBA/B), which interact directly with GP [[cite:PUB00098857]].</p>\n\n<p>Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of PHK (PHKA2) have been shown to be responsible for X-linked liver glycogenosis (XLG).
