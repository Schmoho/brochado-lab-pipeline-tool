{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Guanyl-specific ribonuclease N1 from Neurospora crassa [[cite:PUB00075293]], and similar sequences from fungi and bacteria, including Ribonuclease [swissprot:P00648] from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (also known as Barnase) and Ribonuclease clavin from Aspergillus clavatus. Barnase hydrolyses the phosphodiester bonds in RNA and oligoribonucleotides [[cite:PUB00000397]], resulting in 3'-nucleoside monophosphates via 2',3'-cyclophosphate intermediates. Clavin has the same substrate specificity as alpha-sarcin. It is specific for purines in both single- and double-stranded RNA. Its toxic action on eukaryotic cells is the result of cleavage of a single phosphodiester bond in the 60S subunit of ribosomes [[cite:PUB00094167]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1i0v", "name" "Ribonuclease T1 in complex with 2'GMP (form I crystal)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016191", "name" "Ribonuclease/ribotoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00545" "ribonuclease"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Guanine-specific ribonuclease N1-like", "short" "N1-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 187, "domain_architectures" 128, "proteomes" 2586, "taxa" 8976, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9993, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9880, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6912}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
