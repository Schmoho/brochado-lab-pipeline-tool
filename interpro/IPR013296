{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The small heat shock proteins of vertebrates are thought to play a major role in the cellular response to stress, and appear to play a role in a range of other physiological activities. Indeed, in response to many forms of stress, including heat, the expression of heat shock proteins is increased, and coincidentally these cells become more stress-resistant. One of these proteins is Heat Shock Protein (hsp) 27, for which 3 hypotheses currently exist to explain its mechanism of action: (i) it has chaperone-like activity, serving as a site where denatured, unfolding proteins can bind until hsp70-dependent refolding can occur; (ii) it stabilises microfilaments, strengthening the cytoskeleton; and (iii) it enhances levels of the cellular antioxidant glutathione [[cite:PUB00017253]]. It was hypothesised that hsp27 associates with different protein partners in order to effect its various cellular functions. Thus, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed on a rat Sertoli cell cDNA library, which identified a novel binding protein, termed HSPB1-associated protein 1 or Protein Associated with Small Stress protein 1.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01886" "Protein Associated with Small Stress protein 1 (PASS1)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "HSPB1-associated protein 1", "short" "HSPB1-associated_protein_1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 508, "taxa" 1580, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2285, "sets" 0, "proteins" 763, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 539}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013296", :literature {"PUB00017253" {"URL" nil, "issue" "25", "authors" ["Liu C" "Gilmont RR" "Benndorf R" "Welsh MJ."], "ISO_journal" "J.
