{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents bacteriophage lambda, GpU, a minor tail protein. GpU plays an essential role in tail assembly by capping the rapidly polymerizing tail once it has reached its requisite length and serving as the interaction surface for the completion protein [[cite:PUB00074548]]. GpU forms a hexameric ring within the tail structure since it spontaneously forms such rings in the presence of Mg2+ that match the size of the hexameric rings of gpV that comprise the bulk of the tail tube. However, prior to tail assembly, gpU remains monomeric [[cite:PUB00074548]]. The characteristics of the protein distribution suggest prophage matches in addition to the phage matches.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR035934", "name" "Phage tail protein-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR038512", "name" "GpU-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06141" "Phage minor tail protein U"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Minor tail protein U-like", "short" "Phage_lambda_GpU-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 76, "taxa" 786, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1200, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1200, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 844}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0208", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0208"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009312", :literature {"PUB00074548" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Katsura I."], "ISO_journal" "Adv.
