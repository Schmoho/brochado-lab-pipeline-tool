{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a small family of proteins with a typical Tat (twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence, suggesting that the family is exported in a folded state, perhaps with a bound redox cofactor. Proteins in this family include deferrochelatase/peroxidase EfeB, which is involved in the recovery of exogenous heme iron. It extracts iron from heme while preserving the tetrapyrrole ring intact [[cite:PUB00070842], [cite:PUB00099956]]. Crystal structure of EfeB revealed that it has ferredoxin-like fold domains (N-and C-terminal) consisting of an α+β fold that contains an antiparallel β-sheet composed of four β-strands. A large heme binding pocket is located in the C-terminal domain [[cite:PUB00099956]]. This entry also includes deferrochelatase/peroxidase EfeN from Bacillus subtilis, which shows two domains with a ferredoxin-fold and best activity in the acidic range of pH [[cite:PUB00100762]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6i8o", "name" "Dye type peroxidase Aa from Streptomyces lividans: 39.2kGy structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011008", "name" "Dimeric alpha-beta barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01412" "iron uptake transporter deferrochelatase/peroxidase subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Deferrochelatase", "short" "EfeB/EfeN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1628, "taxa" 6156, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7262, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7262, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5322}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
