{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Synonym(s): Steroid 5-alpha-reductase</p>\n\n<p>3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenases, [ec:1.3.99.5] catalyse the conversion of 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid + acceptor to 3-oxo-delta(4)-steroid + reduced acceptor. The steroid 5-alpha-reductase enzyme is responsible for the formation of dihydrotestosterone, this hormone promotes the differentiation of male external genitalia and the prostate during foetal development [[cite:PUB00007121]]. In humans mutations in this enzyme can cause a form of male pseudohermaphorditism in which the external genitalia and prostate fail to develop normally.</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes the plant related steroid reductases DET2, involved in a reduction step in the biosynthesis of the plant steroid, brassinolide (BL) [[cite:PUB00100738]]. DET2 from Brachypodium distachyon participates in the reduction steps of the biosynthesis of plant campesterol-derivative steroids, ending to castasterone (CS) but missing BL [[cite:PUB00100739]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7c83", "name" "Crystal structure of an integral membrane steroid 5-alpha-reductase PbSRD5A"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF015596" "3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase", "short" "3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid_4-DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1374, "taxa" 5711, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3701, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3682, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2411}, "pathways" 46}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
