{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex SLX5-SLX8 subunit SLX8 from budding yeast, which mediates ubiquitination and subsequent desumoylation/degradation of sumoylated proteins and proteins containing SUMO-like domains. It acts as a critical suppressor of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) during normal cell cycle progression. It is also involved in stabilising, restarting or resolving transiently stalled replication forks. It prevents accumulation of DNA damage during cell cycle progression [[cite:PUB00153033], [cite:PUB00153032], [cite:PUB00153031]].</p>\n\n<p>This entry also includes uncharacterised plant sequences.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47094" "ELFLESS, ISOFORM B"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex SLX5-SLX8 subunit SLX8", "short" "SLX8"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1007, "taxa" 3546, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2764, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2764, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1666}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
