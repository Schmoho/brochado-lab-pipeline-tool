{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant members of the UbiA family of prenyltransferases, including AtHST from Arabidopsis. AtHST catalyses the prenylation and decarboxylation of homogentisate to form 2-methyl-6-solanesyl-1,4-benzoquinol, the first intermediate in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00096152]]. This entry also includes naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase [[cite:PUB00096148]], glycinol 4-dimethylallyltransferase [[cite:PUB00096146]] and 2-acylphloroglucinol 4-prenyltransferase [[cite:PUB00085659]], which share significant homology with homogentisate prenyltransferases.</p>\n\n<p>Prenyltransferases (PTs) catalyse the regioselective transfer of prenyl moieties onto a wide variety of substrates and play an important role in many biosynthetic pathways. Plant aromatic PTs can be divided into two distinct sub-groups: one is 4-hydroxybenzoate PTs, which are involved in ubiquinone (benzoquinone) and naphthoquinone derivatives localised in mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum, and the second sub-group comprises members of the homogentisate PT (HGPT) family, which are involved in vitamin E and plastoquinone biosynthesis [[cite:PUB00096147]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR044878", "name" "UbiA prenyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd13960" "Tocopherol phytyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homogentisate solanesyltransferase AtHST-like", "short" "AtHST-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 457, "taxa" 2332, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2055, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2054, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1311}, "pathways" 11}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
