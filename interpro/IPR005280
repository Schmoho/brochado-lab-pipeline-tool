{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is composed of unusual homoserine kinases, from a subset of bacteria, which have a protein kinase fold. These proteins do not bear any similarity to the GHMP family homoserine kinases (see [interpro:IPR000870]) present in most bacteria and eukaryotes. Homoserine kinase catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to L-homoserine producing L-homoserine phosphate, an intermediate in the production of the amino acids threonine, methionine, and isoleucine. The Type II homoserine kinase subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other kinases, such as the typical serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases (PKs), RIO kinases, actin-fragmin kinase (AFK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [[cite:PUB00081018]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2ppq", "name" "Crystal structure of the homoserine kinase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05153" "Type II Homoserine Kinase"}, "hamap" {"MF_00301" "Homoserine kinase [thrB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00938" "homoserine kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Homoserine kinase, type II", "short" "Homoserine_kinase_II"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1954, "taxa" 8062, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8905, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8905, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6924}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0159", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0159"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
