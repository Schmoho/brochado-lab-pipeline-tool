{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of WD repeat-containing proteins, including Ipi3 from yeasts, WDR18 from animals and RID3 from Arabidopsis. Ipi3 is part of the Rix1 complex required for the processing of 35S pre-rRNA in pre-60S ribosomal particles and for the initiation of DNA replication [[cite:PUB00088146]]. It interacts with pre-RC proteins, binds chromatin predominantly at ARS sequences in a cell cycle-regulated and ORC- and Noc3-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00088146]]. WDR18, the human Ipi3 homologue, is a component of the Five Friends of Methylated CHTOP (5FMC) complex, which is recruited to ZNF148 by methylated CHTOP, leading to desumoylation of ZNF148 and subsequent transactivation of ZNF148 target genes [[cite:PUB00087911]]. It is also involved in human DNA replication licensing [[cite:PUB00087911], [cite:PUB00098315]]. RID3 acts as negative regulator of the CUC-STM pathway in shoot apical meristem (SAM) neo-formation [[cite:PUB00098316]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036322", "name" "WD40-repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR18763" "WD-REPEAT PROTEIN 18"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein WDR18/Ipi3/RID3", "short" "WDR18/Ipi3/RID3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2522, "taxa" 8654, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5033, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5033, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3275}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045227", :literature {"PUB00098315" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Huang Y" "Amin A" "Qin Y" "Wang Z" "Jiang H" "Liang L" "Shi L" "Liang C."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS One", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS One", "title" "A Role of hIPI3 in DNA Replication Licensing in Human Cells.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e0151803", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27057756}, "PUB00088146" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Huo L" "Wu R" "Yu Z" "Zhai Y" "Yang X" "Chan TC" "Yeung JT" "Kan J" "Liang C."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Cycle", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.19709", "medline_journal" "Cell Cycle", "title" "The Rix1 (Ipi1p-2p-3p) complex is a critical determinant of DNA replication licensing independent of their roles in ribosome biogenesis.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "1325-39", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22421151}, "PUB00087911" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Fanis P" "Gillemans N" "Aghajanirefah A" "Pourfarzad F" "Demmers J" "Esteghamat F" "Vadlamudi RK" "Grosveld F" "Philipsen S" "van Dijk TB."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
