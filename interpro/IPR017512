{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases from the methanol/ethanol family, which has a phylogenetic distribution very similar to that coenzyme PQQ biosynthesis enzymes, as shown by partial phylogenetic profiling. Genes in this family often are found adjacent to the PQQ biosynthesis genes themselves. An unusual, strained disulphide bond between adjacent Cys residues contributes to PQQ-binding, as does a Trp residue that is part of a PQQ enzyme repeat (see [interpro:IPR002372]). Characterised members include the dehydrogenase subunit of a membrane-anchored, three subunit alcohol (ethanol) dehydrogenase of Gluconobacter oxydans (Gluconobacter suboxydans), a homodimeric ethanol dehydrogenase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the large subunit of an α2/β2 heterotetrameric methanol dehydrogenase in Methylobacterium extorquens.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1g72", "name" "CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF QUINOPROTEIN METHANOL DEHYDROGENASE: A THEORETICAL AND X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011047", "name" "Quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03075" "PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase, methanol/ethanol family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase, methanol/ethanol family", "short" "PQQ_MeOH/EtOH_DH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 30, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1277, "taxa" 5251, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 10329, "sets" 0, "proteins" 10329, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8087}, "pathways" 16}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0170", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0170"} {"accession" "GenProp1101", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1101"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
