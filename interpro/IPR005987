{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ribonuclease T ([ec:3.1.13]) is an enzyme found so far only in gamma-subdivision proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Xylella fastidiosa. Ribonuclease T is homologous to the DNA polymerase III alpha chain. It can liberate AMP from the common C-C-A terminus of uncharged tRNA. It appears also to be involved in RNA maturation. It also acts as a 3' to 5' single-strand DNA-specific exonuclease; it is distinctive for its ability to remove residues near a double-stranded stem. Ribonuclease T is a high copy suppressor in E. coli of a UV-repair defect caused by deletion of three other single-stranded DNA exonucleases [[cite:PUB00017662]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3v9w", "name" "Crystal structure of RNase T in complex with a preferred ssDNA (TTA) with two Mg in the active site"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR012337", "name" "Ribonuclease H-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036397", "name" "Ribonuclease H superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06134" "DEDDh 3'-5' exonuclease domain of RNase T"}, "hamap" {"MF_00157" "Ribonuclease T [rnt]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01298" "ribonuclease T"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribonuclease T", "short" "RNase_T"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1104, "taxa" 5749, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6181, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6181, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4836}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1360", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1360"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
