{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase (BDH) is involved in the butanol and ethanol formation pathway of some bacteria [[cite:PUB00084423], [cite:PUB00084961]]. The fermentation process is characterised by an acid producing growth phase, followed by a solvent producing phase. The latter phase is associated with the induction of solventogenic enzymes such as butanol dehydrogenase. The activity of the enzymes require NADPH as cofactor, as well as divalent ions zinc or iron.</p>\n\n<p>This family is a member of the iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily. Protein structure has a dehydroquinate synthase-like fold. Proteins in this entry also include TBCH5v1_0547 from Thermococcus barophilus, which is a thermostable type III alcohol dehydrogenase [[cite:PUB00099565]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6c7l", "name" "Structure of Iron containing alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermococcus thioreducens in a tetragonal crystal form"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd08179" "NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase involved in the butanol and ethanol formation pathway in bacteria"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase", "short" "NADPH_BDH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 545, "taxa" 2392, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2086, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2086, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1651}, "pathways" 162}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
