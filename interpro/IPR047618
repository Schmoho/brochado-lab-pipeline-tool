{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes quinone oxidoreductases (QOR) from bacteria and fungi predominantly, with some uncharacterised plant sequences. QOR catalyses the conversion of a quinone NAD(P)H to a hydroquinone NAD(P) [[cite:PUB00118929], [cite:PUB00058932]]. Quinones are cyclic diones derived from aromatic compounds. Membrane bound QOR acts in the respiratory chains of bacteria and mitochondria. QOR reduces quinones through a semi-quinone intermediate via a NAD(P)H-dependent single electron transfer. QOR is a member of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, but lacks the zinc-binding sites of the prototypical alcohol dehydrogenases of this group [[cite:PUB00081596], [cite:PUB00086895], [cite:PUB00081091]]. The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology to GroES. These proteins form homodimers, and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain. NAD(H) binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding [[cite:PUB00081091]].</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes 2-haloacrylate reductase, which catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of a carbon-carbon double bond in organohalogen compounds. Although it has significant sequence similarity to QOR, Burkholderia 2-haloacrylate reductase does not act on the quinones 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone [[cite:PUB00136905]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4rvs", "name" "The native structure of mycobacterial quinone oxidoreductase Rv154c."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd05286" "Quinone oxidoreductase (QOR)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Quinone oxidoreductase-like", "short" "QOR-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 4479, "taxa" 16488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 19982, "sets" 0, "proteins" 19960, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14867}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
