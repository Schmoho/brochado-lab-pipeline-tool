{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative, aerobic coccobacillus that causes pertussis (whooping cough), especially in young children [[cite:PUB00007646]]. Once present in the lungs, the bacterium attaches to ciliated pulmonary epithelial cells via a collection of outer membrane proteins, all of which are virulence factors.</p>\n\n<p>Pertactin, or P69 protein, is one of these virulence factors. Pertactin and filamentous haemagglutinin have been identified as Bordetella adhesins [[cite:PUB00007647]]. Both proteins contain an arg-gly-asp (RGD) motif that promotes binding to integrins, known to be important in cell mobility and development. The production of most Bordetella virulence factors (including pertactin) is controlled by a two-component signal transduction system, comprising the BvgA regulator and the BvgS sensor [[cite:PUB00007648]]. Pertactin shares a high level of similarity with other Bordetella adhesins, such as BrkA. The protein is first produced as a 93kDa precursor. Upon secretion into the extracellular environment, a 30kDa domain at the C terminus remains in the outer membrane, while the mature 60.4kDa pertactin molecule is released [[cite:PUB00007649]].</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structure of mature pertactin has been determined to 2.5A resolution by means of X-ray diffraction. The fold is characterised by a 16-stranded parallel Î²-helix, with a V-shaped cross-section. Several between-strand amino-acid repeats form internal and external ladders. The helical structure is interrupted by several protruding loops that contain motifs associated with the activity of the protein. One such sequence -[GGXXP]5 -appears directly after the RGD motif, and may mediate interaction with epithelial cells. The C-terminal region of P.69 pertactin contains a [PQP]5 motif loop, which contains the major immunoprotective epitope [[cite:PUB00007649]].</p>\n\n<p>The tcfA gene of B. pertussis encodes a unique virulence-associated factor, Tcf (tracheal colonisation factor) [[cite:PUB00007650]]. The derived amino acid sequence of tcfA predicts a 68kDa RGD-containing, proline-rich protein. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that the C-terminal 30kDa of this protein shares ~50% identity with the 30kDa C terminus of the Bordetella pertactin precursor.</p>\n\n<p>The Bordetella resistance to killing, brk, locus has cloned and sequenced and found to encode two divergently transcribed open reading frames (ORFs), designated BrkA and BrkB [[cite:PUB00007651]]. Both ORFs are necessary for serum resistance. BrkA shares ~29% identity with pertactin and contains two RGD motifs, in addition to a proteolytic processing site and an outer membrane targeting signal. BrkA, like pertactin, is involved in adherence and invasion.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036709", "name" "Autotransporter beta-domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01484" "PRTACTNFAMLY"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pertactin virulence factor family", "short" "Pertactin_virulence_factor"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 187, "taxa" 2032, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23792, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4565, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3418}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003991", :literature {"PUB00007646" {"URL" nil, "issue" "10", "authors" ["Charles IG" "Dougan G" "Pickard D" "Chatfield S" "Smith M" "Novotny P" "Morrissey P" "Fairweather NF."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
