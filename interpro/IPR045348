{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes CPSF4/CPSF4L from humans and Yth1 from yeasts. Most members have several CCCH type zinc finger domains, which are responsible for the nucleotide recognition [[cite:PUB00045901], [cite:PUB00098677]].</p>\n\n<p>In animals, the CPSF complex is the central complex of the cleavage and polyadenylation (CP) reaction. It carries the catalytic activity for pre-mRNA cleavage, and its interaction with the AAUAAA sequence is essential for cleavage and the AAUAAA dependence of polyadenylation [[cite:PUB00098682]]. It is composed of five subunits: CPSF160, CPSF100, CPSF73 and CPSF30 (also known as CPSF4) and Fip1. CPSF4 has been shown to bind RNA polymers with a preference for poly(U) [[cite:PUB00098680], [cite:PUB00098679], [cite:PUB00062835]]. In humans, CPSF4 has also been shown to interact with influenza A virus NS1 and block processing of pre-mRNAs, thereby preventing nuclear export of host cell mRNAs [[cite:PUB00098681]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7k95", "name" "Crystal structure of human CPSF30 in complex with hFip1"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23102" "CLEAVAGE AND POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR SUBUNIT 4-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CPSF complex subunit CPSF4-like", "short" "CPSF4/Yth1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2270, "taxa" 7893, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4373, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4373, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2855}, "pathways" 28}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045348", :literature {"PUB00045901" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Tacahashi Y" "Helmling S" "Moore CL."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkg265", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Functional dissection of the zinc finger and flanking domains of the Yth1 cleavage/polyadenylation factor.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "1744-52", "volume" "31", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12626716}, "PUB00098677" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Sun Y" "Zhang Y" "Hamilton K" "Manley JL" "Shi Y" "Walz T" "Tong L."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Molecular basis for the recognition of the human AAUAAA polyadenylation signal.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "E1419-E1428", "volume" "115", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29208711}, "PUB00062835" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Kaufmann I" "Martin G" "Friedlein A" "Langen H" "Keller W."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600070", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "Human Fip1 is a subunit of CPSF that binds to U-rich RNA elements and stimulates poly(A) polymerase.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "616-26", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 14749727}, "PUB00098679" {"URL" nil, "issue" "16", "authors" ["Kiefer H" "Mizutani A" "Iemura S" "Natsume T" "Ando H" "Kuroda Y" "Mikoshiba K."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IRBIT) associates with components of the mRNA 3' processing machinery in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and inhibits polyadenylation.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "10694-705", "volume" "284", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19224921}, "PUB00098678" {"URL" nil, "issue" "52", "authors" ["Barnwal RP" "Lee SD" "Moore C" "Varani G."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "Structural and biochemical analysis of the assembly and function of the yeast pre-mRNA 3' end processing complex CF I.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "21342-7", "volume" "109", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23236150}, "PUB00098682" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Schonemann L" "Kuhn U" "Martin G" "Schafer P" "Gruber AR" "Keller W" "Zavolan M" "Wahle E."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "Reconstitution of CPSF active in polyadenylation: recognition of the polyadenylation signal by WDR33.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "2381-93", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25301781}, "PUB00098681" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Nemeroff ME" "Barabino SM" "Li Y" "Keller W" "Krug RM."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Cell", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Mol Cell", "title" "Influenza virus NS1 protein interacts with the cellular 30 kDa subunit of CPSF and inhibits 3'end formation of cellular pre-mRNAs.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "991-1000", "volume" "1", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9651582}, "PUB00098680" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["Barabino SM" "Hubner W" "Jenny A" "Minvielle-Sebastia L" "Keller W."], "ISO_journal" "Genes Dev", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Genes Dev", "title" "The 30-kD subunit of mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and its yeast homolog are RNA-binding zinc finger proteins.", "year" 1997, "raw_pages" "1703-16", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9224719}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045348", "name" "CPSF complex subunit CPSF4-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
