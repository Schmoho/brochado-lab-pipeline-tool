{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Termicin is a cysteine-rich antifungal peptide, which also exhibits weak antibacterial activity.\r\nThe global fold of termicin consists of an α-helical segment and a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet forming a cysteine stabilised alphabeta motif that is also found in antibacterial and antifungal defensins from insects and from plants. The antifungal properties of termicin may be related to its marked hydrophobicity and its amphipatic structure compared to the antibacterial defensins [[cite:PUB00028964]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036574", "name" "Knottin, scorpion toxin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF11415" "Antifungal peptide termicin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Termicin", "short" "Termicin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 81, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 166, "sets" 0, "proteins" 166, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 164}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR024723", :literature {"PUB00028964" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Da Silva P" "Jouvensal L" "Lamberty M" "Bulet P" "Caille A" "Vovelle F."], "ISO_journal" "Protein Sci.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1110/ps.0228303", "medline_journal" "Protein Sci", "title" "Solution structure of termicin, an antimicrobial peptide from the termite Pseudacanthotermes spiniger.", "year" 2003, "raw_pages" "438-46", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12592014}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR024723", "name" "Termicin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 8, "alignment:full" 2}}}
