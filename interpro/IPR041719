{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents non-heme Ferritins found in archaea and bacteria. They belong to a broad superfamily of ferritin-like diiron-carboxylate proteins. The ferritin protein shell is composed of 24 protein subunits arranged in 432-point symmetry. Each protein subunit, a four-helix bundle with a fifth short terminal helix, contains a dinuclear ferroxidase centre (H type) [[cite:PUB00016824], [cite:PUB00091783]]. Unique to this group of proteins is a third metal site in the ferroxidase centre [[cite:PUB00016769]]. Iron storage involves the uptake of iron (II) at the protein shell, its oxidation by molecular oxygen at the ferroxidase centres, and the movement of iron (III) into the cavity for deposition as ferrihydrite [[cite:PUB00091784]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7xa2", "name" "Thermotoga maritima ferritin variant-Tm-E(S111H)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009078", "name" "Ferritin-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR012347", "name" "Ferritin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01055" "nonheme-containing ferritins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ferritin, prokaryotic-type", "short" "Ferritin_prok"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 91, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2994, "taxa" 13262, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14564, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14564, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11521}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
