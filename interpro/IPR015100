{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Anti-sigma factor A is a transcriptional inhibitor that inhibits sigma 70-directed transcription by weakening its interaction with the core of the host's RNA polymerase. It is an all-helical protein, composed of six helical segments and intervening loops and turns, as well as a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, although neither free anti-sigma factor nor anti-sigma factor bound to sigma-70 has been shown to interact directly with DNA. In solution, the protein forms a symmetric dimer of small (10.59kDa) protomers, which are composed of helix and coil regions and are devoid of Î²-strand/sheet secondary structural elements [[cite:PUB00028758]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036486", "name" "Anti-Sigma Factor A superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09010" "Anti-Sigma Factor A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Anti-Sigma Factor A", "short" "AsiA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 57, "taxa" 853, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 578, "sets" 0, "proteins" 578, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR015100", :literature {"PUB00028758" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Urbauer JL" "Simeonov MF" "Urbauer RJ" "Adelman K" "Gilmore JM" "Brody EN."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
