{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the VraX proteins from Staphylococcus aureus. The vraX gene belongs to the vra operon together with the vraA gene encoding for a long chain fatty acid-CoA ligase, which is up-regulated in the VISA (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus) [[cite:PUB00085343]]. The gene product, a 55-amino acids protein,is upregulated in the stress response to cell wall-active antibiotics and other surface-interactive molecules. VraX harbours a putative phosphorylation site, and could therefore be involved in regulatory processes within the cell. However, no exact function has been demonstrated [[cite:PUB00085344]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17412" "Family of unknown function"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein VraX", "short" "VraX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 7, "taxa" 71, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 63, "sets" 0, "proteins" 63, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 44}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035374", :literature {"PUB00085343" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Lee CR" "Lee JH" "Park KS" "Jeong BC" "Lee SH."], "ISO_journal" "Front Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00828", "medline_journal" "Front Microbiol", "title" "Quantitative proteomic view associated with resistance to clinically important antibiotics in Gram-positive bacteria: a systematic review.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "828", "volume" "6", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26322035}, "PUB00085344" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Taylor PW."], "ISO_journal" "Infect Drug Resist", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S67275", "medline_journal" "Infect Drug Resist", "title" "Impact of space flight on bacterial virulence and antibiotic susceptibility.", "year" 2015, "raw_pages" "249-62", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26251622}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035374", "name" "Protein VraX", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 2, "alignment:full" 9}}}
