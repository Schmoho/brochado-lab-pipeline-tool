{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes the neuron-enriched endosomal proteins NSG1 (NEEP21), NSG2 (P19) and NSG3 (calcyon, Caly). They interact with distinct elements of the endosomal and synaptic scaffolding machinery [[cite:PUB00088059]]. NSG1 and NSG2 may not be resident endosomal proteins, and are also known as neuronal vesicle trafficking-associated proteins 1 and 2 respectively [[cite:PUB00088065]]. NSG1/NEEP21 plays a role in the trafficking of multiple receptors, including the cell adhesion molecule L1/NgCAM, the neurotransmitter receptor GluA2, and beta-APP [[cite:PUB00088062]]. The role of NSG2 is not known.</p>\n\n<p>It was originally thought that the Neuron-specific vesicular protein calcyon (previously known as D1 dopamine receptor-interacting, calcyon), interacted directly with the D1 dopamine receptor (DRD1) to modulate neocortical and hippocampal neuronal excitability as well as cAMP-dependent signalling [[cite:PUB00012349]]. However, this work was retracted, as it was shown that a direct interaction with the dopamine D1 receptor had been misinterpreted [[cite:PUB00064276]].  However, it has been shown that calcyon induces D1DR to stimulate intracellular Ca2+ release, and this suggests a possible functional interaction between calcyon and D1DR, despite there being, as yet, no direct interaction between them. A recent study suggested that calcyon-containing vesicles might transport D1DR by associating calcyon with D1DR through their assembly to clathrin [[cite:PUB00064280]]. However, as a single transmembrane protein, it is currently not clear how calcyon can regulate the internalization of D1DR from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles.</p>\n\n<p>Calcyon is a brain-specific protein, mainly localized in the intracellular endosomal vesicles of dendritic spines in dopamine expressing pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and dorsal striatum region  [[cite:PUB00012349]].  Neuron-specific vesicular protein calcyon has implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is exclusively expressed in neurons, and localized in moving vesicles and it thought to play a role in brain plasticity [[cite:PUB00064277]].   Defective calcyon proteins have been implicated in both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [[cite:PUB00012350], [cite:PUB00064278]] and schizophrenia [[cite:PUB00019244]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28546" "NEURONAL VESICLE TRAFFICKING-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2-RELATED"}, "pfam" {"PF06387" "D1 dopamine receptor-interacting protein (calcyon)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002383" "Neuron specific protein/calcyon"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Neuronal vesicle trafficking-associated protein", "short" "NSG"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 648, "taxa" 2174, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2446, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2291, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1564}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"iuphar" {"displayName" "IUPHAR receptor code", "description" "The IUPHAR database incorporates detailed pharmacological, functional and pathophysiological information on G Protein-Coupled Receptors, Voltage-Gated Ion Channels, Ligand-Gated Ion Channels and Nuclear Hormone Receptors.", "rank" 22, "accessions" [{"accession" "214", "url" "https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=214"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009431", :literature {"PUB00064280" {"URL" nil, "issue" "22", "authors" ["Xiao J" "Dai R" "Negyessy L" "Bergson C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
