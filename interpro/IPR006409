{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents glycerol-3-phosphate cytidyltransferase, also called CDP-glycerol pyrophosphorylase. A closely related protein assigned a different function experimentally is a human ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase ([ec:2.7.7.14]). Glycerol-3-phosphate cytidyltransferase acts in pathways of teichoic acid biosynthesis. Teichoic acids are substituted polymers, linked by phosphodiester bonds, of glycerol, ribitol, etc. An example is poly(glycerol phosphate), the major teichoic acid of the Bacillus subtilis cell wall. Most but not all species encoding proteins in this family are Gram-positive bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1n1d", "name" "Glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase complexed with CDP-glycerol"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01518" "glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase", "short" "G3P_cytidylTrfase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 547, "taxa" 2579, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2140, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2140, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1654}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1398", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1398"} {"accession" "GenProp1756", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1756"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
