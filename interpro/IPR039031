{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mucolipin (TRPML) family members, including Mucolipin 1/2/3 (TRPML1/2/3), are ion channel proteins that belong to the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of cation channels. They are non-selective cation channels with six predicted transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C terminus regions. They have a channel pore located between TM5 and TM6 that is permeable to sodium (Na+) and calcium ions (Ca2+) [[cite:PUB00088777]]. The TRPMLs exist as homomeric or heteromeric channels [[cite:PUB00088780]]. They may play a role in endosome-lysosome fusion, scission of endo-lysosomal hybrid organelle, autophagy, vacuolar pH regulation, exocytosis, and metal homeostasis [[cite:PUB00088777]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6hrr", "name" "Structure of the TRPML2 ELD at pH 6.5"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12127" "MUCOLIPIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mucolipin", "short" "Mucolipin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1104, "taxa" 5698, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6192, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6192, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4076}, "pathways" 4}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039031", :literature {"PUB00088780" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 18", "authors" ["Zeevi DA" "Lev S" "Frumkin A" "Minke B" "Bach G."], "ISO_journal" "J.
