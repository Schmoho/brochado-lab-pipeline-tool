{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal disorder with pancreatic, skeletal and bone marrow deficiencies and a predisposition to hematological dysfunction.  The syndrome is associated with mutations in the SBDS gene, which encodes a protein that is required for biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit and activation of the ribosome [[cite:PUB00088931]].  Maturation of the ribosomal 60S subunit requires SBDS and the GTPase EFL1, which release the anti-association factor eIF6 from the surface of the ribosomal subunit 60S [[cite:PUB00088932]].  In yeast, SBDS is known as Sdo1, which with the EF-2-like GTPase Ria1, may trigger the GTP-dependent release of Tif6 from 60S pre-ribosomes in the cytoplasm, thereby activating them [[cite:PUB00045126]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6fsw", "name" "Structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus SBDS protein at 1.9 Angstrom"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037188", "name" "Ribosome maturation protein Sdo1/SBDS, central domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036786", "name" "Ribosome maturation protein SBDS, N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR10927" "RIBOSOME MATURATION PROTEIN SBDS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ribosome maturation protein Sdo1/SBDS-like", "short" "Sdo1/SBDS-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2936, "taxa" 13012, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8926, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8926, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5957}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039100", :literature {"PUB00088931" {"URL" nil, "issue" "20", "authors" ["Hesling C" "Oliveira CC" "Castilho BA" "Zanchin NI."], "ISO_journal" "Exp.
