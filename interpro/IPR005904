{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoribosyltransferases (PRT) are enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of beta-n-5'-monophosphates from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and an enzyme specific amine. A number of PRT's are involved in the biosynthesis of purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine nucleotides, or in the salvage of purines and pyrimidines. Purine nucleotides are synthesized both via the de novo pathway and via the salvage pathway and are vital for cell functions and cell proliferation through DNA and RNA syntheses and ATP energy supply.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3acd", "name" "Crystal structure of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase with IMP from Thermus thermophilus HB8"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029057", "name" "Phosphoribosyltransferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01203" "hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase", "short" "Hxn_phspho_trans"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 102, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 7542, "taxa" 28370, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 31337, "sets" 0, "proteins" 31337, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 23596}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1235", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1235"} {"accession" "GenProp1528", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1528"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
