{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Haptoglobin is a plasma protein that binds haemoglobin. The resulting complex is too large to be excreted by the kidney, thereby preventing loss of iron and damage to the kidney. The haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex is degraded in the liver, which is also the site of haptoglobin synthesis. The mature haptoglobin molecule is a tetramer, consisting of two alpha and two beta chains. Alpha and beta chains arise from proteolytic processing of the same precursor. Each beta chain can bind an α-β heterodimer of haemoglobin so that each haptoglobin tetramer binds one haemoglobin tetramer. In Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee), haptoglobin genes form a small multigene family of three genes: HP, HPR (haptoglobin-related protein, which may be non-functional), and HPP (haptoglobin-primate) [[cite:PUB00011145]]. In contrast, most humans have a two-gene cluster due to an unequal homologous crossover event between HPR and HPP in the human lineage [[cite:PUB00011146]]. Such events may be common among these closely related genes as Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) was found to have haplotypes of one- or two-gene clusters that appear to have formed from unequal crossover among an ancestral three-gene cluster [[cite:PUB00011147]]. The haptoglobin precursor contains a signal sequence, a sushi domain (in mature alpha chain), and a trypsin domain (in mature beta chain) which belongs to the MEROPS peptidase family S1 (clan PA(S)). Haptoglobins have no enzymatic activity as the active site residues typical of trypsin-related proteases are not conserved, they are therefore classed as non-peptidase homologues. A common allelic variant in humans contains two sushi domains.</p>\n\n<p>Uncleaved haptoglobin is also known as zonulin, and plays a role in intestinal permeability [[cite:PUB00089999]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043504", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan, chymotrypsin-like fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR009003", "name" "Peptidase S1, PA clan", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001137" "Haptoglobin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Haptoglobin", "short" "Haptoglobin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 524, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 383, "sets" 0, "proteins" 316, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 214}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR008292", :literature {"PUB00011145" {"URL" nil, "issue" "30", "authors" ["McEvoy SM" "Maeda N."], "ISO_journal" "J.
