{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>YjcQ is a protein of approx. 100 residues containing four α helices and three β strands. It is found in bacteria and also in the Lactococcus phage Tuc2009. In bacteria it appears to be under the regulation of SigD RNA polymerase which is responsible for the expression of many genes encoding cell-surface proteins related to flagellar assembly, motility, chemotaxis and autolysis in the late exponential growth phase. The exact function of YjcQ is unknown [[cite:PUB00044550]]. However, it is thought to be the major head protein in viruses [[cite:PUB00044231]] and is found in prophage in bacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036388", "name" "Winged helix-like DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036390", "name" "Winged helix DNA-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF09639" "YjcQ protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage Tuc2009, YjcQ", "short" "Phage_Tuc2009_YjcQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 128, "taxa" 755, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 470, "sets" 0, "proteins" 470, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 330}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR018597", :literature {"PUB00044550" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Serizawa M" "Yamamoto H" "Yamaguchi H" "Fujita Y" "Kobayashi K" "Ogasawara N" "Sekiguchi J."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2003.12.024", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Systematic analysis of SigD-regulated genes in Bacillus subtilis by DNA microarray and Northern blotting analyses.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "125-36", "volume" "329", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15033535}, "PUB00044231" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Ventura M" "Canchaya C" "Pridmore RD" "Brussow H."], "ISO_journal" "Virology", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2003.11.034", "medline_journal" "Virology", "title" "The prophages of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "229-42", "volume" "320", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15016546}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR018597", "name" "Bacteriophage Tuc2009, YjcQ", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 9, "alignment:full" 137}}}
