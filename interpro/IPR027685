{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Shroom family is a small group of related proteins that are defined by sequence similarity and in most cases by some link to the actin cytoskeleton. The Shroom (Shrm) protein family is found only in animals. Proteins of this family are predicted to be utilised in multiple morphogenic and developmental processes across animal phyla to regulate cells shape or intracellular architecture in an actin and myosin-dependent manner [[cite:PUB00043542]]. The Shrm family consists of:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Shrm1 (formerly Apx), first found in Xenopus [[cite:PUB00043668]]. Human Shroom1 links a membrane bound protein to the actin cytoskeleton [[cite:PUB00071560]].</li>\r\n<li>Shrm2 (formerly Apxl), a protein involved in the morphogenesis, maintenance, and/or function of vascular endothelial cells.</li>\r\n<li>Shrm3 (formerly Shroom), a protein necessary for neural tube closure in vertebrate development as deficiency in Shrm results in spina bifida. Shrm3 is also conserved in some invertebrates, as orthologues can be found in sea urchins.</li>\r\n<li>Shrm4, a regulator of cyto-skeletal architecture that may play an important role in vertebrate development. It is implicated in X-linked mental retardation in humans.</li></ul>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR15012" "APICAL PROTEIN/SHROOM-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shroom family", "short" "Shroom_fam"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 859, "taxa" 3375, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6026, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6026, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2310}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR027685", :literature {"PUB00071560" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Dye DE" "Karlen S" "Rohrbach B" "Staub O" "Braathen LR" "Eidne KA" "Coombe DR."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
