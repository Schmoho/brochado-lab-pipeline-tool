{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the MoaA protein (molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A), also known as cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase or GTP 3',8-cyclase.</p>\n\n<p>MoaA is a member of the wider S-adenosylmethionine(SAM)-dependent enzyme family which catalyze the formation of protein and/or substrate radicals by reductive cleavage of SAM via a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Monomeric and homodimeric forms of MoaA have been observed <i>in vivo</i>, and it is not clear what the physiologically relevant form of the enzyme is [[cite:PUB00015124]]. The core of each monomer consists of an incomplete TIM barrel, formed by the N-terminal region of the protein, containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The C-terminal region of the protein, which also contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster consists of a β-sheet covering the lateral opening of the barrel, an extended loop and three α-helices. The N-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster is coordinated with 3 cysteines and an exchangeable SAM molecule, while the C-terminal [4Fe-4S], also coordinated with 3 cysteines, is the binding and activation site for GTP [[cite:PUB00036007]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The majority of molybdenum-containing enzymes utilise a molybdenum cofactor (MoCF or Moco) consisting of a Mo atom coordinated via a cis-dithiolene moiety to molybdopterin (MPT).
