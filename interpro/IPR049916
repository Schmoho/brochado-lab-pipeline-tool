{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes WD repeat-containing protein 7 and WD repeat-containing protein 72 (WDR7/72). WDR72 plays a major role in formation of tooth enamel [[cite:PUB00153333], [cite:PUB00153334]]. It is specifically required during the maturation phase of amelogenesis for normal formation of the enamel matrix and clearance of enamel proteins. It may be involved in localization of the calcium transporter SLC24A4 to the ameloblast cell membrane. These proteins consist of a domain architecture comprising one or two β-propellers followed by an α-solenoid, which is a highly conserved architecture among proteins that form membrane coat complexes, dating back to the early eukaryotic endomembrane system [[cite:PUB00153334]]. The function of WDR7 is currently unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR44099" "RABCONNECTIN-3B, ISOFORM A"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "WD repeat-containing protein 7/72", "short" "WDR7/72"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1732, "taxa" 6464, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5312, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5312, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1710}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049916", :literature {"PUB00153333" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["El-Sayed W" "Parry DA" "Shore RC" "Ahmed M" "Jafri H" "Rashid Y" "Al-Bahlani S" "Al Harasi S" "Kirkham J" "Inglehearn CF" "Mighell AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Am J Hum Genet", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.09.014", "medline_journal" "Am J Hum Genet", "title" "Mutations in the beta propeller WDR72 cause autosomal-recessive hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "699-705", "volume" "85", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19853237}, "PUB00153334" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Katsura KA" "Horst JA" "Chandra D" "Le TQ" "Nakano Y" "Zhang Y" "Horst OV" "Zhu L" "Le MH" "DenBesten PK."], "ISO_journal" "Matrix Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2014.06.005", "medline_journal" "Matrix Biol", "title" "WDR72 models of structure and function: a stage-specific regulator of enamel mineralization.", "year" 2014, "raw_pages" "48-58", "volume" "38", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 25008349}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR049916", "name" "WD repeat-containing protein 7/72", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
