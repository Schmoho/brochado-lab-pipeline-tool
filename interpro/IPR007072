{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains Rhamnosyl O-methyltransferase which catalyses the O-methylation of the hydroxyl group located on C-2 of the first rhamnosyl residue linked to the phenolic group of glycosylated phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosates (PGL) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (p-HBAD) [[cite:PUB00053670]]. Members of this family are about 220 amino acids long. It also includes the CmcI protein [swissprot:O85726], which was previously thought to represent the cephalosporin-7--hydroxylase [[cite:PUB00008735]], however, it is apparently a methyltransferase that works with hydroxylase CmcJ, and its most likely function is to catalyse the transfer of a methyl group from SAM to the 7alpha-hydroxy cephalosporin in the second catalytic reaction of cephamycin formation. Studies using recombinant proteins purified from E. coli suggest that the complex, but not the separate proteins, exhibits a strong interaction with SAM and cephalosporin C [[cite:PUB00039678]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF04989" "Rhamnosyl O-methyltransferase/CmcI"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Rhamnosyl O-methyltransferase", "short" "RNMT_CmcI"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 50, "proteomes" 504, "taxa" 3571, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2989, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2956, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2216}, "pathways" 145}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
