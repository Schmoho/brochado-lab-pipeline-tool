{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of fungal proteins includes tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase, cyclic dipeptide N-prenyltransferase (CdpNPT), fumigaclavine C synthase (FgaPT1), dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS), indole diterpene prenyltransferase anaPT and related proteins. CdpNPT accepts a variety of tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides, including L-tryptophan itself, and prenylates these substrates inverse at the N-1 position of the indole group [[cite:PUB00080704]]. FgaPT1 catalyses the prenylation of fumigaclavine A [[cite:PUB00080703]]. Dimethylallyltryptophan synthases (DMATS) catalyzes the prenylation of L-tryptophan at C-4 of the indole ring during the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids [[cite:PUB00042956]]. AnaPT is required for the biosynthesis of the prenylated pyrroloindoline diketopiperazine acetylaszonalenin [[cite:PUB00083133]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5kd6", "name" "Crystal structure of the aromatic prenyltransferase AtaPT from Aspergillus terreus A8-4 in complex with dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate and (-)-butyrolactone II"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF000509" "Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aromatic prenyltransferase DMATS-type, fungi", "short" "DMATS-type_fun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 22, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 387, "taxa" 1065, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1584, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1557, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1013}, "pathways" 47}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
