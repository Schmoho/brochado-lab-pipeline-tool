{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is found in the microviridae (isometric ssDNA phages) and are approximately 60 amino acids in length. The function of these proteins are unknown. In phi X174 site-directed mutagenesis of gene K produces small plaques on su- hosts. The mutant phage has an identical latent period, but a more reduced burst size than that of the wild-type phi X174. The reduced burst size in the gene K mutant suggests that the gene K protein, although not essential, has a role in increasing infectivity by increasing the burst size three to six fold [[cite:PUB00053261]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF12283" "Bacteriophage protein K"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Bacteriophage phiX174, GpK", "short" "Phage_phiX174_GpK"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 173, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 89, "sets" 0, "proteins" 89, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 19}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020962", :literature {"PUB00053261" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Gillam S" "Atkinson T" "Markham A" "Smith M."], "ISO_journal" "J.
