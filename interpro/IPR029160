{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 4 (UQCC4), a family of proteins that was discovered in a screen of Bos taurus placental ESTs. The B. taurus member of this family was named cattle cerebrum and skeletal muscle-specific transcript 1 (CCSMST1) [[cite:PUB00054093]], hence the alternative name of the family. This family of proteins is found in metazoa, both in vertebrates and invertebrates. Proteins are typically between 97 and 157 amino acids in length with a single completely conserved residue D that may be functionally important. UQCC4 is required for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III (CIII) or cytochrome b-c1 complex), a multisubunit transmembrane complex that is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) which drives oxidative phosphorylation [[cite:PUB00103608]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR35268" "PROTEIN CCSMST1"}, "pfam" {"PF15013" "CCSMST1 family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 4", "short" "UQCC4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 28, "proteomes" 528, "taxa" 2569, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 840, "sets" 0, "proteins" 837, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 521}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029160", :literature {"PUB00103608" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Liang C" "Zhang S" "Robinson D" "Ploeg MV" "Wilson R" "Nah J" "Taylor D" "Beh S" "Lim R" "Sun L" "Muoio DM" "Stroud DA" "Ho L."], "ISO_journal" "Cell Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Cell Rep", "title" "Mitochondrial microproteins link metabolic cues to respiratory chain biogenesis.", "year" 2022, "raw_pages" "111204", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 35977508}, "PUB00054093" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Larson JH" "Kumar CG" "Everts RE" "Green CA" "Everts-van der Wind A" "Band MR" "Lewin HA."], "ISO_journal" "Physiol.
