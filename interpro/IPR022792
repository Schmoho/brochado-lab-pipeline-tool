{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>GspN is a cytoplasmic membrane component of the type II secretion system (T2SS). It is present in T2SS operons of a subset of Gram-negative speciesI, such as Aeromonas hydrophila (gene exeN); Erwinia carotovora (gene outN); Klebsiella pneumoniae (gene pulN); or Vibrio cholerae (gene epsN) [[cite:PUB00093998]]. The size of the 'N' protein is around 250 amino acids. It apparently contains a single transmembrane domain located in the N-terminal section. The short N-terminal domain is\npredicted to be cytoplasmic and the large C-terminal domain periplasmic.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>The type II secretion system (T2SS) is one of several extracellular secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria. It delivers toxins and a range of hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-active enzymes to the cell surface or extracellular space [[cite:PUB00093998]]. T2SS systems are composed of 11 to 15 different proteins, which are generally called GspA to GspO and GspS. The T2SS spans the two bacterial membranes and ensures secretion of folded proteins across the outer membrane pore formed by GspD. The inner membrane complex contains GspC, GspL, GspM, and GspF. The cytoplasmic domains of GspL and GspF interact with an ATPase, GspE. GspE is thought to energize the formation of a short pseudopilus by several pilin-like proteins, GspG to GspK [[cite:PUB00094004]]. GspD has been shown to interact with the inner membrane component GspC [[cite:PUB00051842]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01203" "Type II secretion system (T2SS), protein N"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II secretion system protein GspN", "short" "T2SS_protein-GspN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 7, "proteomes" 1117, "taxa" 4543, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4817, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4815, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3639}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0053", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0053"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022792", :literature {"PUB00094002" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Lopez-Castilla A" "Vitorge B" "Khoury L" "Morellet N" "Francetic O" "Izadi-Pruneyre N."], "ISO_journal" "Biomol NMR Assign", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Biomol NMR Assign", "title" "1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments and secondary structure of PulG, the major pseudopilin from Klebsiella oxytoca type 2 secretion system.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "155-158", "volume" "11", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28258547}, "PUB00051842" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Korotkov KV" "Pardon E" "Steyaert J" "Hol WG."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2008.11.011", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the secretin GspD from ETEC determined with the assistance of a nanobody.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "255-65", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19217396}, "PUB00094004" {"URL" nil, "issue" "23", "authors" ["Wang X" "Pineau C" "Gu S" "Guschinskaya N" "Pickersgill RW" "Shevchik VE."], "ISO_journal" "J.
