{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Helicobacter pylori makes use of a type IV secretion system similar in mechanism to the conjugation machine of Agrobacterium tumefaciens [[cite:PUB00007668]]. These machines secrete three different types of substrate: DNA conjugation intermediates, as in A. tumefaciens; multimeric proteins such as the pertussis toxin of Bordetella pertussis; and the CagA protein of H. pylori. CagA has been linked to the more severe forms of gastric ulcers and duodenal cancers [[cite:PUB00007669]]. Both CagA and the secretion system apparatus are encoded in the large pathogenicity island, termed cag [[cite:PUB00007669]], possessed by the malignant disease-causing type I bacterial strains.</p>\n\n<p>CagX is found on this pathogenicity island; mutants lacking the gene fail to induce pathogenicity in an infected mouse model. CagX is thought to play a role in the process of conjugation [[cite:PUB00007670]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5h3v", "name" "Crystal structure of a Type IV Secretion System Component CagX in Helicobacter pylori"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR038161", "name" "VirB9/CagX/TrbG, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01556" "TYPE4SSCAGX"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type IV secretion system CagX conjugation protein", "short" "IVSec_CagX"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 7, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 69, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3045, "sets" 0, "proteins" 240, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 222}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004357", :literature {"PUB00007668" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Christie PJ" "Vogel JP."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Microbiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0966-842X(00)01792-3", "medline_journal" "Trends Microbiol", "title" "Bacterial type IV secretion: conjugation systems adapted to deliver effector molecules to host cells.", "year" 2000, "raw_pages" "354-60", "volume" "8", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 10920394}, "PUB00007669" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Asahi M" "Azuma T" "Ito S" "Ito Y" "Suto H" "Nagai Y" "Tsubokawa M" "Tohyama Y" "Maeda S" "Omata M" "Suzuki T" "Sasakawa C."], "ISO_journal" "J.
