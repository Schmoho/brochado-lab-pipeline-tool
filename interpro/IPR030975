{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family, related to streptomycin biosynthesis protein StrG and to phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase, belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase clan, which includes not just dioxygenases such as phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase PhyH, but also some chlorinating enzymes involved in natural product biosynthesis. Members of this family occur so far only in O-antigen biosynthesis regions of select Leptospira, and include an ~80 residue additional C-terminal region shared by no other proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR04436" "putative 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase", "short" "SpoChoClust_3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 46, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 14}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR030975", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR030975", "name" "Putative 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
