{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Under osmotic stress, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidises glycine betaine aldehyde into the osmoprotectant glycine betaine, via the second of two oxidation steps from exogenously supplied choline or betaine aldehyde. This choline-glycine betaine synthesis pathway can be found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In Escherichia coli, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (betB) is osmotically co-induced with choline dehydrogenase (betA) in the presence of choline. These dehydrogenases are located in a betaine gene cluster with the upstream choline transporter (betT) and transcriptional regulator (betI) [[cite:PUB00013491]].</p>\n\n<p>Similar to E. coli, betaine synthesis in Staphylococcus xylosus is also influenced by osmotic stress and the presence of choline with genes localised in a functionally equivalent gene cluster [[cite:PUB00013492]]. Organisation of the betaine gene cluster in Rhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium meliloti) and Bacillus subtilis differs from that of E. coli by the absence of upstream choline transporter and transcriptional regulator homologues [[cite:PUB00013492], [cite:PUB00013493]]. Additionally, B. subtilis co-expresses a type II alcohol dehydrogenase with betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase instead of choline dehydrogenase as in E. coli, S. xylosus, and S. meliloti [[cite:PUB00013493]]. Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. BetB from P. aeruginosa catalyses the irreversible oxidation of betaine aldehyde to the corresponding acid, a compulsory step in the assimilation of carbon and nitrogen when bacteria are growing in choline or choline precursors and it can use NADP+ with similar efficiency to NAD+, a property that can be used by the bacterium to produce the NADPH needed to combat the oxidative stress imposed by the host defenses [[cite:PUB00058453]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4cbb", "name" "APO FORM OF BETAINE ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE FROM Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016162", "name" "Aldehyde dehydrogenase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR016161", "name" "Aldehyde/histidinol dehydrogenase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00804" "Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase [betB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01804" "betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase", "short" "BADH"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 37, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1076, "taxa" 5198, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5177, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5177, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3968}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0147", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0147"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
