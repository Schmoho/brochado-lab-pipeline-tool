{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents SpoVID, the stage VI sporulation protein D, which is restricted to endospore-forming bacteria, all of which are found among the Firmicutes. It is widely distributed but not quite universal in this group. Between well-conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains is a poorly conserved, low-complexity region of variable length, rich in glutamic acid. SpoVID is involved in spore coat assembly in the mother cell compartment late in the process of sporulation.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02907" "stage VI sporulation protein D"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sporulation stage VI, protein D", "short" "Spore_VI_D"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 217, "taxa" 642, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 662, "sets" 0, "proteins" 662, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 466}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0610", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0610"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014256", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR014256", "name" "Sporulation stage VI, protein D", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
