{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes sequences that belong to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family such as Macrolide glycosyltransferase from Streptomyces lividans (MGT), a glucosyl transferase for macrolide antibiotic inactivation, and Demethyllactenocin mycarosyltransferase from Streptomyces fradiae, a transferase of glucose-related sugars for macrolide antibiotic production [[cite:PUB00100297]]. This entry also includes NDP-glycosyltransferase YjiC from Bacillus subtilis, a gycosyltransferase that can glycosylate a wide range of substrates, including various flavonoids, phenyl ketones, curcuminoid, lignins, zingerone, triterpenes, stilbene, anthraquinone and simple aromatics [[cite:PUB00100298], [cite:PUB00100296]].
