{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) is a brain-localised peptide that acts as a satiety factor in appetite regulation.  CART was found to inhibit both normal and starvation-induced feeding, and completely blocks the feeding response induced by neuropeptide Y. CART is regulated by leptin in the hypothalamus, and can be transcriptionally induced after cocaine or amphetamine administration [[cite:PUB00013270]]. CART has also been suggested to activate ERK1 through interaction with a specific G-protein coupled receptor [[cite:PUB00088370]]. Posttranslational processing of CART produces an N-terminal CART peptide and a C-terminal CART peptide. The C-terminal CART peptide has been isolated from the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and the anterior pituitary lobe in rats. C-terminal CART is the biologically active part of the molecule affecting food intake. The structure of C-terminal CART consists of a disulphide-bound fold containing a Î²-hairpin and two adjacent disulphide bridges [[cite:PUB00012344]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036722", "name" "CART, C-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06373" "Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript protein (CART)"}, "panther" {"PTHR16655" "COCAINE AND AMPHETAMINE REGULATED TRANSCRIPT PROTEIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CART satiety factor", "short" "CART"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 511, "taxa" 1903, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1784, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1777, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1125}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009106", :literature {"PUB00013270" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6680", "authors" ["Kristensen P" "Judge ME" "Thim L" "Ribel U" "Christjansen KN" "Wulff BS" "Clausen JT" "Jensen PB" "Madsen OD" "Vrang N" "Larsen PJ" "Hastrup S."], "ISO_journal" "Nature", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/29993", "medline_journal" "Nature", "title" "Hypothalamic CART is a new anorectic peptide regulated by leptin.", "year" 1998, "raw_pages" "72-6", "volume" "393", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 9590691}, "PUB00012344" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Ludvigsen S" "Thim L" "Blom AM" "Wulff BS."], "ISO_journal" "Biochemistry", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi010433u", "medline_journal" "Biochemistry", "title" "Solution structure of the satiety factor, CART, reveals new functionality of a well-known fold.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "9082-8", "volume" "40", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11478874}, "PUB00088370" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1-2", "authors" ["Lakatos A" "Prinster S" "Vicentic A" "Hall RA" "Kuhar MJ."], "ISO_journal" "Neurosci.
