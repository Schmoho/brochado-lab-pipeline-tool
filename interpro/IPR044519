{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs), such as AGD6/7 from Arabidopsis. ArfGAPs are a family of proteins containing an ArfGAP catalytic domain that induces the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Arf, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases.  AGD7 interacts with Arf1 and stimulates Arf1 GTPase activity in a phosphatidic acid-dependent manner. It is localised to the Golgi complex and may play a critical role in protein trafficking by controlling Arf1 activity [[cite:PUB00085839]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR47021" "ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN AGD6-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein AGD6/7", "short" "ARF_GAP_AGD6/7"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 283, "taxa" 1178, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1049, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1049, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 628}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044519", :literature {"PUB00085839" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Sieburth LE" "Muday GK" "King EJ" "Benton G" "Kim S" "Metcalf KE" "Meyers L" "Seamen E" "Van Norman JM."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.039008", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell", "title" "SCARFACE encodes an ARF-GAP that is required for normal auxin efflux and vein patterning in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2006, "raw_pages" "1396-411", "volume" "18", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 16698946}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0005096", "name" "GTPase activator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016192", "name" "vesicle-mediated transport", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044519", "name" "ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein AGD6/7", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
