{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The conversion of dTDP-glucose into dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose by Escherichia coli dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase takes place in the active site in three steps: dehydrogenation to dTDP-4-ketoglucose, dehydration to dTDP-4-ketoglucose-5,6-ene, and rereduction of C6 to the methyl group. The 4,6-dehydratase makes use of tightly bound NAD<sup>+</sup>as the coenzyme for transiently oxidizing the substrate, activating it for the dehydration step [[cite:PUB00007907]]. This and other 4,6-dehydratases catalyze the first committed step in all 6-deoxysugar biosynthetic pathways described to date. Numerous 6-deoxysugars are used in bacterial lipopolysaccharide production as well as in the biosynthesis of a diverse array of secondary metabolites.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1bxk", "name" "DTDP-GLUCOSE 4,6-DEHYDRATASE FROM E.
