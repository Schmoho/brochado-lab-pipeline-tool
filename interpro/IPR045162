{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the Vps15 family of proteins. Vsp15 homologue in S. pombe is known as ppk19. In animals, proteins part of this family are known as Phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 4 (Pik3r4).</p>\n\n<p>Vps15 associates and regulates Vps34, also called Class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which catalyses the phosphorylation of D-myo-phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) [[cite:PUB00077159]]. Vps34 is the only PI3K present in yeast. It plays an important role in the regulation of protein and vesicular trafficking and sorting, autophagy, trimeric G-protein signalling, and phagocytosis [[cite:PUB00098175], [cite:PUB00098176], [cite:PUB00052984], [cite:PUB00098178], [cite:PUB00098177]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3gre", "name" "Crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps15 WD repeat domain"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR17583" "PHOSPHOINOSITIDE 3-KINASE REGULATORY SUBUNIT 4"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Serine/threonine-protein kinase Vps15-like", "short" "Vps15-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2573, "taxa" 8807, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 5438, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5438, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1095}, "pathways" 40}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
