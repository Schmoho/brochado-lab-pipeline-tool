They are homologous to phosphoadenosine phosphosulphate (PAPS) reductase in enterobacteria, cyanobacteria, and yeast, and perform the same overall function in activating inorganic sulphate. They also show detectable homology with plant APS reductase. The presence of two conserved C-terminal motifs (CCXXRKXXPL and SXGCXXCT), thought to form an iron-sulphur cluster distinguishes APS reductases from PAPS reductases.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR014729", "name" "Rossmann-like alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02055" "adenylylsulfate reductase, thioredoxin dependent"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate reductase", "short" "APS_reductase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2144, "taxa" 9181, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9102, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9102, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7153}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
