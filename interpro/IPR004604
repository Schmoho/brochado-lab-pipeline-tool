{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA repair protein RecN is thought to be DNA damage inducible and involved in recombinational processes. The N-terminal region of most of the bacterial RecN proteins sequenced to date contains an ATP/GTP binding domain within an SMC-like motif. SMC-like domains are involved in chromosomal scaffolding and segregation. It is possible that the function of RecN in homologous recombination is either structural or enzymatic or both. RecN may be involved in the proper positioning of the recombining segments of DNA, ensuring normal recombination. The observation that inactivation of this gene leads to a decreased transformation efficiency, as well as increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, may be due to some defect in chromosomal partitioning or positioning during these recombination-dependent processes [[cite:PUB00007688]]. The protein may function presynaptically to process double-stranded breaks to produce 3 single-stranded DNA intermediates during recombination.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF003128" "DNA repair protein RecN"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00634" "DNA repair protein RecN"}, "panther" {"PTHR11059" "DNA REPAIR PROTEIN RECN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA recombination/repair protein RecN", "short" "DNA_recomb/repair_RecN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8865, "taxa" 33791, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 41796, "sets" 0, "proteins" 41774, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 31545}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0491", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0491"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004604", :literature {"PUB00007688" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Skaar EP" "Lazio MP" "Seifert HS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
