{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a bifunctional enzyme of the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway. They contain both CbiH precorrin-3B C(17)-methyltransferase ([ec:2.1.1.131], [interpro:IPR006363]) and CbiC precorrin-8X methylmutase ([ec:5.4.1.2], [interpro:IPR003722]). CbiH catalyses the methylation of precorrin-3B at C-17 to produce precorrin-4. CbiC catalyses catalyses a methyl rearrangement in precorrin-8 that moves the methyl group from C-11 to C-12 to produce hydrogenobyrinic acid [[cite:PUB00014669]].</p>\r\n<p>CbiH belongs to the superfamily of tetrapyrrole (corrin/porphyrin) methylases ([interpro:IPR000878]), which includes methylases that use S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) in the methylation of diverse substrates. A number of other methylases in the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway also belong to this domain superfamily (precorrin-3 methylase, [interpro:IPR012382], [interpro:IPR012797], amongst others), and a fusion of precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferases with precorrin isomerase is represented by [interpro:IPR014422].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a structurally complex cofactor, consisting of a modified tetrapyrrole with a centrally chelated cobalt.
