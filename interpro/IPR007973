{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several bacterial sex pilus assembly and synthesis proteins (TraE). Conjugal transfer of plasmids from donor to recipient cells is a complex process in which a cell-to-cell contact plays a key role. Many genes encoded by self-transmissible plasmids are required for various processes of conjugation, including pilus formation, stabilisation of mating pairs, conjugative DNA metabolism, surface exclusion and regulation of transfer gene expression [[cite:PUB00010475]]. The exact function of the TraE protein is unknown.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05309" "TraE protein"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02761" "type IV conjugative transfer system protein TraE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Pilus assembly TraE", "short" "Pilus_assembly_TraE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 11, "proteomes" 391, "taxa" 2718, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3343, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3343, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2651}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0485", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0485"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR007973", :literature {"PUB00010475" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Komano T" "Yoshida T" "Narahara K" "Furuya N."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
