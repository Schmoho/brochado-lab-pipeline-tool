{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents HemN, the oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase that replaces HemF function under anaerobic conditions. HemN catalyses the anaerobic transformation of coproporhyrinogen-III into protoporphyrinogen-IX during porphyrin biosynthesis. Several species, including Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Aquifex aeolicus, have both a member of this family and a member of another, closely related family for which there is no evidence of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase activity, [interpro:IPR004559]. Members of this family have a perfectly conserved motif PYRT[SC]YP in a region N-terminal to the region of homology with the related uncharacterised protein.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00277" "oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase 1 (HemN-like)"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000167" "Oxygen independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00538" "oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN", "short" "Coprogen_oxidase_HemN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3565, "taxa" 14735, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16200, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16187, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 12611}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0221", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0221"} {"accession" "GenProp1686", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1686"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
