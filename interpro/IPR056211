{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the T2SS protein NttC from Legionella pneumophila ([swissprot:A0A0C9MKT2]) and related proteins found mainly in other Legionella species. NttC has a key role during L.pneumophila infection of Vermamoeba vermiformis and Willaertia magna amoebas. It folds into an Ig-like β-sandwich containing ten β-strands and an α-helix which provides one of the pair cysteines involved in the disulfide bond formation. NttC is unusual in that it lacks a compact core and instead contains a buried internal cavity [[cite:PUB00155764]]. This cavity was proposed to bind a variety of organic molecules [[cite:PUB00155764]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF24268" "T2SS substrate NttC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "T2SS substrate NttC-like", "short" "NttC-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 29, "taxa" 102, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 94, "sets" 0, "proteins" 94, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 85}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR056211", :literature {"PUB00155764" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Portlock TJ" "Tyson JY" "Dantu SC" "Rehman S" "White RC" "McIntire IE" "Sewell L" "Richardson K" "Shaw R" "Pandini A" "Cianciotto NP" "Garnett JA."], "ISO_journal" "Front Mol Biosci", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00112", "medline_journal" "Front Mol Biosci", "title" "Structure, Dynamics and Cellular Insight Into Novel Substrates of the <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> Type II Secretion System.", "year" 2020, "raw_pages" "112", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 32656228}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR056211", "name" "T2SS substrate NttC-like", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 26, "alignment:full" 32}}}
