{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are small, generally only 100 amino acids in length. The gene is almost invariably the upstream member of a gene pair, where the downstream member is a predicted DNA-binding protein.

Analysis suggests that the gene pair may serve as an addiction module.</p>\n\n<p>Member of this family from cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 is predicted to be a component of a putative Type II TA system [[cite:PUB00153573]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR41791" "SSL7039 PROTEIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF028744" "Uncharacterised conserved protein, Gp-49 type"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02683" "type II toxin-antitoxin system RelE/ParE family toxin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Type II toxin-antitoxin system RelE/ParE-like toxin, predicted", "short" "TypeIITA-like_toxin_pred"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 933, "taxa" 6238, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 7030, "sets" 0, "proteins" 7027, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5298}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0471", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0471"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014056", :literature {"PUB00153573" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Kopfmann S" "Roesch SK" "Hess WR."], "ISO_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins8070228", "medline_journal" "Toxins (Basel)", "title" "Type II Toxin-Antitoxin Systems in the Unicellular Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
