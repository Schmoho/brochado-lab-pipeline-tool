{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of proteins is functionally uncharacterised. This family of proteins is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Proteins in this family are typically between 137 and 165 amino acids in length.  Proteins in this family are related to the thiosulfate transporter, but appear to be about half the length. This suggests that this family may operate as a dimer to make a functional transporter.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF20398" "Family of unknown function (DUF6691)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6691", "short" "DUF6691"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 29, "proteomes" 2747, "taxa" 10691, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9987, "sets" 0, "proteins" 9947, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7511}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR046513", :literature nil, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR046513", "name" "Protein of unknown function DUF6691", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 4, "alignment:full" 2885}}}
