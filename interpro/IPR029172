{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Prion protein (PrP) is intimately linked with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The human PrP gene (PRNP) locus contains three genes: PRNP, DOPPEL and PRND. A novel gene, designated PRNT, has been identified 3kb 3' to PRND and is transcribed to generate at least three alternatively spliced mRNAs. PRNT constitutes a family of putative prion-related proteins expressed in the testis [[cite:PUB00069842], [cite:PUB00069843]]. This group of eukaryotic proteins are typically between 52 and 94 amino acids in length.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF15174" "Prion-related protein testis-specific"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Putative testis-specific prion protein", "short" "PRNT"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 5, "taxa" 88, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 21, "sets" 0, "proteins" 21, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 18}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR029172", :literature {"PUB00069842" {"URL" nil, "issue" nil, "authors" ["Preuss S" "Peischl T" "Melchinger E" "Geldermann H."], "ISO_journal" "Gene", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2003.12.030", "medline_journal" "Gene", "title" "Numerous polymorphic microsatellites in the human prion gene complex (including PRNP, PRND and PRNT).", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "197-203", "volume" "329", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15033541}, "PUB00069843" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Watts JC" "Westaway D."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
