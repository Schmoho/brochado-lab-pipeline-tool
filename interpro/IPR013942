{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Mediator complex is a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. On recruitment the Mediator complex unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNA polymerase II, specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mediator complex is composed of at least 31 subunits: MED1, MED4, MED6, MED7, MED8, MED9, MED10, MED11, MED12, MED13, MED13L, MED14, MED15, MED16, MED17, MED18, MED19, MED20, MED21, MED22, MED23, MED24, MED25, MED26, MED27, MED29, MED30, MED31, CCNC, CDK8 and CDC2L6/CDK11.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the Med19 subunit of the Mediator complex in fungi.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR28270" "MEDIATOR OF RNA POLYMERASE II TRANSCRIPTION SUBUNIT 19"}, "pfam" {"PF08633" "Rox3 mediator complex subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mediator complex, subunit Med19, fungi", "short" "Mediator_Med19_fun"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 17, "proteomes" 963, "taxa" 2571, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1421, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1418, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 913}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR013942", :literature nil, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003712", "name" "transcription coregulator activity", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006357", "name" "regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0016592", "name" "mediator complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR013942", "name" "Mediator complex, subunit Med19, fungi", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 56, "alignment:full" 591}}}
