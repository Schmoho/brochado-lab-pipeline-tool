{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Acetyl-CoA synthetase (also known as acetate-CoA ligase and acetyl-activating enzyme) is a ubiquitous enzyme, found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which catalyses the formation of acetyl-CoA from acetate, coenzyme A (CoA) and ATP as shown below [[cite:PUB00028098]]: <reaction>ATP + acetate + CoA = AMP + diphosphate + acetyl-CoA</reaction> The activity of this enzyme is crucial for maintaining the required levels of acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate in many important biosynthetic and catabolic processes. It is especially important in eukayotic species as it is the only route for the activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA in these organisms (some prokaryotic species can also activate acetate by either acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase or by ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthase). Eukaryotes typically have two isoforms of acetyl-CoA synthase, a cytosolic form involved in biosynthetic processes and a mitochondrial form primarily involved in energy generation.</p>\n\n<p>The crystal structures of a eukaryotic ([swissprot:Q01574], from yeast) and bacterial ([swissprot:Q8ZKF6], from Salmonella) form of this enzyme have been determined [[cite:PUB00028099], [cite:PUB00028100]]. The yeast enzyme is trimeric, while the bacterial enzyme is monomeric. The trimeric state of the yeast protein may be unique to this organism however, as the residues involved in the trimer interface are poorly conserved in other sequences. Despite differences in the oligomeric state of the two enzyme, the structures of the monomers are almost identical. A large N-terminal domain (~500 residues) containing two parallel β sheets is followed by a small (~110 residues) C-terminal domain containing a three-stranded β sheet with helices. The active site occurs at the domain interface, with its contents determining the orientation of the C-terminal domain.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pg4", "name" "Acetyl CoA Synthetase, Salmonella enterica"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042099", "name" "ANL, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01123" "Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase [acs]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR02188" "acetate--CoA ligase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acetate-CoA ligase", "short" "Ac_CoA_lig"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 54, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 8885, "taxa" 32904, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37463, "sets" 0, "proteins" 37459, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 28097}, "pathways" 25}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1379", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1379"} {"accession" "GenProp1715", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1715"} {"accession" "GenProp1722", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1722"} {"accession" "GenProp1687", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1687"} {"accession" "GenProp1749", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1749"} {"accession" "GenProp0480", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0480"} {"accession" "GenProp1437", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1437"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
