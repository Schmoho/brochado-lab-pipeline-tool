{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The AML1 (also known as RUNX1) gene is rearranged by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia [[cite:PUB00004459]]. The gene is highly similar to the Drosophila melanogaster segmentation gene runt and to the mouse transcription factor PEBP2 alpha subunit gene [[cite:PUB00004459]]. The region of shared similarity, known as the Runt domain, is responsible for DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction.<p>In addition to the highly-conserved Runt domain, the AML-1 gene product carries a putative ATP-binding site (GRSGRGKS), and has a C-terminal region rich in proline and serine residues. The protein (known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein, oncogene AML-1, core-binding factor (CBF), alpha-B subunit, etc.) binds to the core site, 5'-pygpyggt-3', of a number of enhancers and promoters.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1eaq", "name" "The RUNX1 Runt domain at 1.25A resolution: A structural switch and specifically bound chloride ions modulate DNA binding"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11950" "RUNT RELATED"}, "prints" {"PR00967" "ONCOGENEAML1"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1)/Runt", "short" "AML1_Runt"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1001, "taxa" 4004, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12609, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6192, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3823}, "pathways" 103}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000040", :literature {"PUB00004459" {"URL" nil, "issue" "14", "authors" ["Miyoshi H" "Ohira M" "Shimizu K" "Mitani K" "Hirai H" "Imai T" "Yokoyama K" "Soeda E" "Ohki M."], "ISO_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/23.14.2762", "medline_journal" "Nucleic Acids Res", "title" "Alternative splicing and genomic structure of the AML1 gene involved in acute myeloid leukemia.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "2762-9", "volume" "23", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7651838}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003677", "name" "DNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005524", "name" "ATP binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0006355", "name" "regulation of DNA-templated transcription", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}} {"identifier" "GO:0005634", "name" "nucleus", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR000040", "name" "Acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1)/Runt", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR016554", "name" "Runt-related transcription factor RUNX", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
