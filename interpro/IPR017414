{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry contains a subset of the AS2/LOB (ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES) gene family that are highly homologous and plant specific.</p>\n\n<p>The N terminus contains a conserved approximately 100-amino acid domain (the LOB domain) that is present in A. thaliana proteins and in proteins from a variety of other plant species. Genes encoding LOB domain (LBD) proteins are expressed in a variety of temporal- and tissue-specific patterns, suggesting that they may function in diverse processes [[cite:PUB00018358], [cite:PUB00073509]]. The LOB domain contains conserved blocks of amino acids that identify the LBD gene family. In particular, a conserved C-x(2)-C-x(6)-C-x(3)-C motif, which is defining feature of the LOB domain, is present in all LBD proteins. It is possible that this motif forms a new zinc finger [[cite:PUB00018358]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038155" "Protein ASYMMETRIC LEAVES"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "LOB domain-containing protein", "short" "LOBD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 163, "taxa" 646, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 479, "sets" 0, "proteins" 464, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 283}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017414", :literature {"PUB00073509" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Matsumura Y" "Iwakawa H" "Machida Y" "Machida C."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03797.x", "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "Characterization of genes in the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (AS2/LOB) family in Arabidopsis thaliana, and functional and molecular comparisons between AS2 and other family members.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "525-37", "volume" "58", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19154202}, "PUB00018358" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Shuai B" "Reynaga-Pena CG" "Springer PS."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.010926", "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "The lateral organ boundaries gene defines a novel, plant-specific gene family.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "747-61", "volume" "129", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12068116}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017414", "name" "LOB domain-containing protein", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
