{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the small ribosomal subunit protein uS12m found mainly in the mitochondria of some trypanosomatid species.</p>\n\n<p>RPS12 is a ribosomal protein encoded by the kinetoplast mitochondrion of Kinetoplastida protists such as Trypanosoma. Homologous RPS12 proteins in bacterial ribosomes participate in stabilizing the second base pair of the codon-anticodon duplex in the A site and is likely to be critical for the fidelity of decoding process. A similar role can be anticipated for this protein in mitochondrial ribosomes. This has been shown where the product of edited RPS12 mRNA translation represented a component of the mitoribosome's small subunit [[cite:PUB00085312]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17487" "Ribosomal protein S12"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS12m", "short" "Ribosomal_uS12m"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 48, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 16, "sets" 0, "proteins" 16, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 15}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035306", :literature {"PUB00085312" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Aphasizheva I" "Maslov DA" "Aphasizhev R."], "ISO_journal" "RNA Biol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.26733", "medline_journal" "RNA Biol", "title" "Kinetoplast DNA-encoded ribosomal protein S12: a possible functional link between mitochondrial RNA editing and translation in Trypanosoma brucei.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1679-88", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24270388}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR035306", "name" "Small ribosomal subunit protein uS12m", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
