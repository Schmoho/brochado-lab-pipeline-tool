Suv4-20 family members are a group of histone H4K20 methyltransferases that play an important role in epigenetic regulation. Lower eukaryotes have a single Suv4-20, while mammals have two closely related Suv4-20 paralogs, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2 [[cite:PUB00096027]]. In mammals H4K20me2 is generated primarily by SUV420H1/KMT5B (which can also produce H4K20me3), while H4K20me3 is mostly generated by SUV420H2/KMT5C [[cite:PUB00096022]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3rq4", "name" "Crystal structure of suppressor of variegation 4-20 homolog 2"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR041938", "name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12977" "SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION 4-20-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase Suv4-20/Set9", "short" "Suv4-20/Set9"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 13, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1959, "taxa" 6497, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4290, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4290, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2435}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
