{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family of peptidases consists of hydrogenase expression/formation proteins, such as HoxM from Cupriavidus necator (also known as Alcaligenes eutrophus) and HybD from E. coli. They belong to the MEROPS peptidase family A31.</p>\n\n<p>Nickel/iron hydrogenases are synthesized as two subunits, with the larger subunit containing the metallo centre.  Once nickel has bound, the large subunit is activated by processing at a conserved site near the C terminus [[cite:PUB00011020]].  The HycI endopeptidase releases a 32-residue peptide by cleavage of an Arg+Met bond [[cite:PUB00011022]].  A 15-residue peptide is released from hydrogenase 2 by cleavage of a His+Met bond by the HybD endopeptidase [[cite:PUB00011024]].</p>\n\n<p>The tertiary structure of HybD has been solved, and shows a twisted β sheet with three α helices on one side and four on the other [[cite:PUB00011023]].  The molecule binds a single cadmium ion, which led to the peptidase being incorrectly identified as a metallopeptidase.  It is possible that the metal binding site interacts with the nickel in the hydrogenase substrate [[cite:PUB00011023]].  The fold is similar to that of members of family A25, and both families A25 and A31 are included in the same clan, AE.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023430", "name" "Peptidase HybD-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00140" "HyaD/HybD family hydrogenase maturation endopeptidase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Peptidase A31, hydrogenase expression/formation protein", "short" "Pept_A31_hyd_express"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 497, "taxa" 2905, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3616, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3616, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2935}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
