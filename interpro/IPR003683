{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of cytochrome b6/f complex subunit 5 (PetG). The cytochrome bf complex, found in green plants, eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria, connects photosystem I to photosystem II in the electron transport chain, functioning as a plastoquinol:plastocyanin/cytochrome c6 oxidoreductase [[cite:PUB00008158]]. The purified complex from the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains seven subunits; namely four high molecular weight subunits (cytochrome f, Rieske iron-sulphur protein, cytochrome b6, and subunit IV) and three approximately miniproteins (PetG, PetL, and PetX) [[cite:PUB00008159]]. Stoichiometry measurements are consistent with every subunit being present as two copies per b6/f dimer. The absence of PetG affects either the assembly or stability of the cytochrome bf complex in C. reinhardtii [[cite:PUB00008158]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "9es7", "name" "Cryo-EM structure of Spinacia oleracea cytochrome b6f complex with water molecules at 1.94 A resolution"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036099", "name" "Cytochrome b6/f complex, subunit 5 superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_00432" "Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 5 [petG]"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000034" "Cytochrome b6-f complex, subunit V"}, "pfam" {"PF02529" "Cytochrome B6-F complex subunit 5"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome b6/f complex, subunit 5", "short" "Cyt_6/f_cplx_su5"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 14, "proteomes" 270, "taxa" 20973, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 13917, "sets" 0, "proteins" 13914, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11229}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1353", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1353"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003683", :literature {"PUB00008158" {"URL" nil, "issue" "49", "authors" ["Berthold DA" "Schmidt CL" "Malkin R."], "ISO_journal" "J.
