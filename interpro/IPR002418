{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The class III basic helix-turn-helix (bHLH) transcription factors have proliferative and apoptotic roles and are characterised by the presence of a leucine zipper adjacent to the bHLH domain. The myc oncogene was first discovered in small-cell lung cancer cell lines where it is found to be deregulated [[cite:PUB00003650]]. The Myc protein contains an N-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain followed by a nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal basic DNA binding domain tethered to a helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (HLH-Zip) dimerization motif. Myc forms a heterodimer with Max, and this complex regulates cell growth through direct activation of genes involved in cell replication [[cite:PUB00005562], [cite:PUB00005465], [cite:PUB00096614]].</p>\n\n<p>The `leucine zipper' is a structure that is believed to mediate the function of several eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins. The zipper consists of a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position, and regions containing them appear to span eight turns of Î±-helix. The leucine side chains that extend from one helix interact with those from a similar helix, hence facilitating dimerisation in the form of a coiled-coil. Leucine zippers are present in many gene regulatory proteins, including the CREB proteins, Jun/AP1 transcription factors, fos oncogene and fos-related proteins, C-myc, L-myc and N-myc oncogenes, and so on.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6g6k", "name" "The crystal structures of Human MYC:MAX bHLHZip complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF001705" "Myc protein"}, "prints" {"PR00044" "LEUZIPPRMYC"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcription regulator Myc", "short" "Tscrpt_reg_Myc"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 827, "taxa" 5014, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12604, "sets" 0, "proteins" 5064, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3616}, "pathways" 27}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002418", :literature {"PUB00003650" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Kaye F" "Battey J" "Nau M" "Brooks B" "Seifter E" "De Greve J" "Birrer M" "Sausville E" "Minna J."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
