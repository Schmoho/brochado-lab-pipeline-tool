{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme catalyses the oxidation of ubiquinol with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water.  This acts as the terminal electron acceptor in the respiratory chain.  Subunit II is responsible for binding and oxidation of the ubiquinone substrate.  This sequence is closely related to QoxA, which oxidizes quinol in Gram-positive bacteria but which is in complex with subunits which utilise cytochrome a in the reduction of molecular oxygen.  Slightly more distantly related is subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase which uses cytochrome c as the oxidant [[cite:PUB00006602]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01433" "ubiquinol oxidase subunit II"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF000292" "Ubiquinol oxidase, subunit II"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit II", "short" "Cyt_o_ubiquinol_oxidase_su2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 15, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1663, "taxa" 7935, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8869, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8861, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 7030}, "pathways" 7}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1164", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1164"} {"accession" "GenProp1493", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1493"} {"accession" "GenProp1256", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1256"} {"accession" "GenProp0618", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0618"} {"accession" "GenProp1563", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1563"} {"accession" "GenProp1641", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1641"} {"accession" "GenProp1401", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1401"} {"accession" "GenProp1751", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1751"} {"accession" "GenProp1367", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1367"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
