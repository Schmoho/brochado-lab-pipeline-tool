{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a family of monooxygenase components that include Methane monooxygenase regulatory protein B (MmoB), and Phenol 2-monooxygenase, stimulatory component DmpM. When MmoB is present at low concentration it converts methane monooxygenase from an oxidase to a hydroxylase and stabilises intermediates required for the activation of dioxygen [[cite:PUB00009481]]. DmpM lacks redox co-factors and is required for optimal turnover of Phenol hydroxylase [[cite:PUB00009482]]. This protein catabolises phenol and some of its methylated derivatives in the first step of phenol biodegradation, and is required for growth on phenol.</p>\n\n<p>This family also includes Propane 2-monooxygenase, effector component (MimD) which has been shown to function as a coupling protein in the multicomponent propane 2-monooxygenase enzyme system in the degradation of propane as well as the conversion of phenol to hydroquinone [[cite:PUB00088161]].</p>\n\n<p>Toluene-4-monooxygenase system, effector component (TmoD) from Pseudomonas mendocina also belongs to this group. It catalyses the O2 and NADH-dependent hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol [[cite:PUB00025088]], and the Alkene monooxygenase system, effector subunit from Xanthobacter autotrophicus, which catalyses the O2 and NADH-dependent epoxidation of short chain (C2 to C6) alkenes to their corresponding epoxides [[cite:PUB00088050]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2bf3", "name" "Crystal structure of a toluene 4-monooxygenase catalytic effector protein variant missing ten N-terminal residues (delta-N10 T4moD)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036889", "name" "Monooxygenase component MmoB/DmpM superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF02406" "MmoB/DmpM family"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Monooxygenase component MmoB/DmpM", "short" "MOase_MmoB_DmpM"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 40, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 499, "taxa" 2488, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2242, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2242, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1890}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
