{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Polycomb proteins such as Pc function to ensure correct deployment of developmental programs by epigenetically repressing target gene expression.  Pc itself is regulated by midnolin.  Midnolin interacts with the proteasome and recruits Pc to the complex enabling ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of Pc [[cite:PUB00089459]].  In<i>Drosophila</i>, midnolin is known as stuxnet.  In mouse embryos, midnolin is strongly expressed in the midbrain mesencephalon on day 12.5.  Midnolin is located in the nucleus and nucleolus and contains a ubiquitin domain [[cite:PUB00089460]].  In rat pancreatic beta cells, midnolin is also found in the cytoplasm where it interacts with and inhibits glucokinase, and the midnolin gene is upregulated when glucose levels are low [[cite:PUB00089461]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23010" "MIDNOLIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Midnolin", "short" "Midnolin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 672, "taxa" 2925, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1514, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1514, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 936}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR039336", :literature {"PUB00089459" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Du J" "Zhang J" "He T" "Li Y" "Su Y" "Tie F" "Liu M" "Harte PJ" "Zhu AJ."], "ISO_journal" "Dev.
