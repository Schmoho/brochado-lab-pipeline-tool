{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), an enzyme found in all multicellular plants, catalyses the formation of oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and a hydrocarbonate ion [[cite:PUB00004561]]. This reaction is harnessed by C4 plants to capture and concentrate carbon dioxide into the photosynthetic bundle sheath cells. It also plays a key role in the nitrogen fixation pathway in legume root nodules: here it functions in concert with glutamine, glutamate and asparagine synthetases and aspartate amido transferase, to synthesise aspartate and asparagine, the major nitrogen transport compounds in various amine-transporting plant species [[cite:PUB00004559]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR015813", "name" "Pyruvate/Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR30523" "PHOSPHOENOLPYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE"}, "prints" {"PR00150" "PEPCARBXLASE"}, "pfam" {"PF00311" "Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase", "short" "PEP_COase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 24, "domain_architectures" 101, "proteomes" 5606, "taxa" 23710, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 34593, "sets" 0, "proteins" 29704, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 22531}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1267", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1267"} {"accession" "GenProp1669", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1669"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
