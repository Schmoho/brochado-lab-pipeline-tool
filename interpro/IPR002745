{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Tpt1 and its homologues from all domains of life. Tpt1 was first discovered as an essential component of the fungal tRNA splicing pathway, which characteristically generates a 2'-PO4, 3'-5' phosphodiester splice junction during the tRNA ligation reaction [[cite:PUB00094147]]. It is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of an internal RNA 2'-monophosphate (2'-PO4) to NAD+ to form a 2'-OH RNA, ADP-ribose 1\"-2\" cyclic phosphate, and nicotinamide [[cite:PUB00094142]].</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, many Tpt1 homologues have no obvious need for an RNA 2'-phosphotransferase because: (i) they lack tRNA introns; and/or (ii) they are not known to have an enzymatic pathway that generates 2'-PO4, 3'-5' phosphodiester RNA structures. There are more evidence showing that Tpt1 homologues are not limited to the canonical activity of Tpt1 healing the 2'-PO4, 3'-5' phosphodiester RNA splice junction formed during fungal and plant tRNA splicing [[cite:PUB00094148]]. Instead, the ADP-ribosyl transfer to a phosphorylated substrate is the unifying mechanistic feature of Tpt1-catalyzed reactions. For instance, some Tpt1 homologues have been shown to catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a 5'-monophosphate end of RNA or DNA to install a 5'-phospho-ADP-ribose cap structure [[cite:PUB00094146]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6e3a", "name" "tRNA 2'-phosphotransferase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR042080", "name" "RNA 2'-phosphotransferase, N-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR042081", "name" "RNA 2'-phosphotransferase, C-terminal domain", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01885" "RNA 2'-phosphotransferase, Tpt1 / KptA family"}, "panther" {"PTHR12684" "PUTATIVE PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphotransferase KptA/Tpt1", "short" "Ptrans_KptA/Tpt1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 17, "domain_architectures" 210, "proteomes" 3710, "taxa" 14900, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12184, "sets" 0, "proteins" 12048, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8302}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
