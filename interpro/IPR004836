{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>exchange proteins are involved in maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup>homeostasis in a wide variety of cell types. They are found in both the plasma membrane and intracellular organellar membranes, where they exchange Na<sup>+</sup>for Ca<sup>2+</sup>in an electrogenic manner. When located in the plasma membrane, they generally utilise the transmembrane (TM) Na<sup>+</sup>concentration gradient in order to extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup>from cells. Three mammalian isoforms have been cloned to date (NCX1-3), which consist of 920-970 amino acid residues that are predicted to possess 11 or 12 TM domains. Interestingly, they possess a short motif (~30 residues) that is similar to the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, although its function is unknown [[cite:PUB00005133], [cite:PUB00002973]].</p>\n\n<p>NCX1 has been found to be predominantly expressed in the heart, where it plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling, but it is also abundant in a variety of other tissues [[cite:PUB00005133]]. NCX2 and NCX3 transcripts have been detected in the brain and skeletal muscle [[cite:PUB00002973], [cite:PUB00006595]]. Homologous Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange proteins have also been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster (known as Calx) and Loligo opalescens (California market squid).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00845" "sodium/calcium exchanger 1"}, "prints" {"PR01259" "NACAEXCHNGR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sodium/calcium exchanger protein", "short" "Na_Ca_Ex"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 4, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1047, "taxa" 5023, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 15037, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8592, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5334}, "pathways" 13}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR004836", :literature {"PUB00005133" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4980", "authors" ["Nicoll DA" "Longoni S" "Philipson KD."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/250/4980/562", "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Molecular cloning and functional expression of the cardiac sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger.", "year" 1990, "raw_pages" "562-5", "volume" "250", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 1700476}, "PUB00002973" {"URL" nil, "issue" "40", "authors" ["Nicoll DA" "Quednau BD" "Qui Z" "Xia YR" "Lusis AJ" "Philipson KD."], "ISO_journal" "J.
