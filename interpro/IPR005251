{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family contains proteins designated as 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase (MTNA, [ec:5.3.1.23], [[cite:PUB00016716]]). It also contains putative translation initiation factor 2B subunit proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase (MTNA) participates in the methionine salvage pathway catalysing the isomerisation of 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate to 5-methylthio ribulose-1-phosphate [[cite:PUB00016714]]. The methionine salvage pathway leads to the synthesis of methionine from methylthioadenosine, the end product of the spermidine and spermine anabolism in many species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The delineation of this family is based in part on a discussion and neighbour-joining phylogenetic study [[cite:PUB00004919], [cite:PUB00016925]], of archaeal and other proteins homologous to the alpha, beta, and delta subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B), a five-subunit molecule that catalyzes GTP recycling for eIF-2. The archaeal proteins are related to the common ancestor of eIF-2B alpha, beta, and delta rather then specifically to any one of them, and that designation of particular archaeal members as corresponding to eIF-2B alpha or eIF-2B delta is imprecise. It has been suggested that designating the archaeal proteins as translation initiation factors remains unproven.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1t5o", "name" "Crystal structure of the translation initiation factor eIF-2B, subunit delta, from A. fulgidus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR037171", "name" "NagB/RpiA transferase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR027363", "name" "Methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase, N-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01678" "Putative methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase [mtnA]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00512" "S-methyl-5-thioribose-1-phosphate isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase", "short" "IF-M1Pi"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 5396, "taxa" 23337, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22739, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22735, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 16586}, "pathways" 17}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0729", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0729"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
