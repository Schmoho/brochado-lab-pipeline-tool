{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The band-7 protein family comprises a diverse set of membrane-bound proteins characterised by the presence of a conserved domain, the band-7 domain, also known as SPFH or PHB domain. The exact function of the band-7 domain is not known, but examples from animal and bacterial stomatin-type proteins demonstrate binding to lipids and the ability to assemble into membrane-bound oligomers that form putative scaffolds [[cite:PUB00076124]].</p>\n\n<p>A variety of proteins belong to the band-7 family. These include the stomatins, prohibitins, flottins and the HflK/C bacterial proteins. Eukaryotic band 7 proteins tend to be oligomeric and are involved in membrane-associated processes. Stomatins are involved in ion channel function, prohibitins are involved in modulating the activity of a membrane-bound FtsH protease and the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, and flotillins are involved in signal transduction and vesicle trafficking [[cite:PUB00093791]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Stomatin, also known as human erythrocyte membrane protein band 7.2b [[cite:PUB00093790]], was first identified in the band 7 region of human erythrocyte membrane proteins. It is an oligomeric, monotopic membrane protein associated with cholesterol-rich membranes/lipid rafts. Human stomatin is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues; highly in hematopoietic cells, relatively low in brain. It is associated with the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles of fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00093790]].</p>\n\n<p>Stomatin is believed to be involved in regulating monovalent cation transport through lipid membranes. Absence of the protein in hereditary stomatocytosis is believed to be the reason for the leakage of Na<SUP>+</SUP>and K<SUP>+</SUP>ions into and from erythrocytes [[cite:PUB00002046]]. Stomatin is also expressed in mechanosensory neurons, where it may interact directly with transduction components, including cation channels [[cite:PUB00068598]].</p>\n\n<p>Stomatin proteins have been identified in various organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans. There are nine stomatin-like proteins in C. elegans, MEC-2 being the one best characterised [[cite:PUB00068627]]. In mammals, other stomatin family members are stomatin-like proteins SLP1, SLP2 and SLP3, and NPHS2 (podocin), which display selective expression patterns [[cite:PUB00068600]]. Stomatin family members are oligomeric, they mostly localise to membrane domains, and in many cases have been shown to modulate ion channel activity.</p>\n\n<p>The stomatins and prohibitins, and to a lesser extent flotillins, are highly conserved protein families and are found in a variety of organisms ranging from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes, whereas HflK and HflC homologues are only present in bacteria [[cite:PUB00093791]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the stomatins and stomatin-like proteins, including podicin, from a wide range of eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea and viruses.
