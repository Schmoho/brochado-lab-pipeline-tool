{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the transcriptional regulator SutA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and similar proteins found in gammaproteobacteria. SutA causes widespread changes in gene expression, and plays a direct role in the regulation of genes encoding ribosomal components. It associates with chromosomal DNA through interaction with RNA polymerase. This protein contributes to biofilm formation and secondary metabolite production, and it is important during transitions to and from the survival state [[cite:PUB00151317]]. SutA shows a central Î±-helix with unstructured N- and C-terminal tails [[cite:PUB00151416]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF041490" "transcriptional regulator SutA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Transcriptional regulator SutA", "short" "SutA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 60, "taxa" 712, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 863, "sets" 0, "proteins" 863, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 707}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR048080", :literature {"PUB00151317" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Babin BM" "Bergkessel M" "Sweredoski MJ" "Moradian A" "Hess S" "Newman DK" "Tirrell DA."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "SutA is a bacterial transcription factor expressed during slow growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "E597-605", "volume" "113", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 26787849}, "PUB00151416" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Bergkessel M" "Babin BM" "VanderVelde D" "Sweredoski MJ" "Moradian A" "Eggleston-Rangel R" "Hess S" "Tirrell DA" "Artsimovitch I" "Newman DK."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14337", "medline_journal" "Mol Microbiol", "title" "The dormancy-specific regulator, SutA, is intrinsically disordered and modulates transcription initiation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "year" 2019, "raw_pages" "992-1009", "volume" "112", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 31254296}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR048080", "name" "Transcriptional regulator SutA", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
