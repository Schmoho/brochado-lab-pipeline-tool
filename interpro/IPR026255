{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>NAD(P) transhydrogenase ([ec:1.6.1.1]), a tetramer composed of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits, is an integral membrane protein that couples the proton transport across the membrane to the reversible transfer of hydride ion equivalents between NAD and NADP. This family is the is the alpha subunit. An alternate name is pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase alpha subunit. The N-terminal region is homologous to alanine dehydrogenase. In some species, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, the alpha chain is replaced by two shorter chains, both with some homology to the full-length alpha chain modelled here.
