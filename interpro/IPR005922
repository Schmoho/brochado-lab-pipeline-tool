{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ubiquitous higher plant enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; [ec:4.3.1.24]) is a key biosynthetic catalyst in phenylpropanoid assembly. PAL catalyses the non-oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid. PAL contains a catalytic Ala-Ser-Gly triad that is post-translationally cyclised. PAL is structurally similar to the mechanistically related histidine ammonia lyase (HAL; [ec:4.3.1.3]), with PAL having an additional approximately 160 residues extending from the common fold [[cite:PUB00031359]]. Catalysis in PAL may be governed by the dipole moments of seven Î±-helices associated with the PAL active site. The cofactor 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) resides atop the positive poles of three helices, for increasing its electrophillicity. Plant and fungal PAL enzymes contain aa approximately 100-residue long C-terminal multi-helix domain, which might play a role in the rapid response of PAL in the regulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by destabilising the enzyme [[cite:PUB00035855]]. This entry also includes fungal proteins such as Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase CLZ10 which mediates the biosynthesis of squalestatin S1 with potent cholesterol lowering activity by targeting squalene synthase (SS) [[cite:PUB00097889]], and Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase hkm12 involved in the biosynthesis of hancockiamides, an unusual new family of N-cinnamoylated piperazines [[cite:PUB00097890]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1y2m", "name" "Crystal structure of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from yeast Rhododporidium toruloides"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008948", "name" "L-Aspartase-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR023144", "name" "Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, shielding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01226" "phenylalanine ammonia-lyase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase", "short" "Phe_NH3-lyase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 20, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 899, "taxa" 3303, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4941, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4924, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3067}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
