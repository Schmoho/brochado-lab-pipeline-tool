{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are about 265 residues long and each contains an S4 RNA-binding domain of about 48 residues. The member from the Cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), was detected as a novel polypeptide in a highly purified preparation of active photosystem II [[cite:PUB00042838]]. The phylogenetic distribution, including Cyanobacteria and Arabidopsis, supports a role in photosystem II, although the high bit score cut-off for this model excludes similar sequences in non-photosynthetic organisms such as Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans, a Gram-positive bacterium.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03069" "photosystem II S4 domain protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Photosystem II S4", "short" "PSII_S4"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 463, "taxa" 2290, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1246, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1246, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 824}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0661", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0661"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017506", :literature {"PUB00042838" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Kashino Y" "Koike H" "Yoshio M" "Egashira H" "Ikeuchi M" "Pakrasi HB" "Satoh K."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcf168", "medline_journal" "Plant Cell Physiol", "title" "Low-molecular-mass polypeptide components of a photosystem II preparation from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus.", "year" 2002, "raw_pages" "1366-73", "volume" "43", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 12461137}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR017506", "name" "Photosystem II S4", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
