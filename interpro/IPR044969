In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes are separated into two daughter cells. In meiosis II, the sister chromosomes are then separated into newly formed daughter cells. During prophase I, several events occurs: sister chromatid cohesion, homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, crossover formation and chromosome segregation. Homologous recombination is initiated from the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The formation of DSBs is catalyzed by Spo11 and its homologues. So far, six Arabidopsis proteins,  AtSPO11-1, AtSPO11-2, AtPRD1, AtPRD2, AtPRD3 and AtDFO,  have been shown to be involved in DSB formation [[cite:PUB00097637]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR37176" "F10K1.23"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein DOUBLE-STRAND BREAK FORMATION", "short" "DFO"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 212, "taxa" 821, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 494, "sets" 0, "proteins" 494, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 297}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044969", :literature {"PUB00097638" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Zhang C" "Song Y" "Cheng ZH" "Wang YX" "Zhu J" "Ma H" "Xu L" "Yang ZN."], "ISO_journal" "Plant J", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant J", "title" "The Arabidopsis thaliana DSB formation (AtDFO) gene is required for meiotic double-strand break formation.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "271-81", "volume" "72", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22694475}, "PUB00097637" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Tang Y" "Yin Z" "Zeng Y" "Zhang Q" "Chen L" "He Y" "Lu P" "Ye" "Zhang X."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "MTOPVIB interacts with AtPRD1 and plays important roles in formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks in Arabidopsis.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "10007", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28855712}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0042138", "name" "meiotic DNA double-strand break formation", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044969", "name" "Protein DOUBLE-STRAND BREAK FORMATION", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
