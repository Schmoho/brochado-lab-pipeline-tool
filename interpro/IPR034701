{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Diadenylate cyclase catalyses the condensation of 2 ATP molecules into cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), a signaling compound secreted into the host's cytosol by bacterial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes. This compound triggers the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP), a host pathway of innate immunity [[cite:PUB00070986]]. Apart from a role in the establishment of bacterial infection, c-di-AMP seems to be involved in coordinating bacterial growth, cell wall stability, and responses to stress [[cite:PUB00078859]].</p>\n\n<p>Most bacteria possess one diadenylate cyclase (DAC) enzyme (CdaA, also called YbbP and DacA), while Bacillus subtilis has two additional DACs (CdaS, also called YojJ and DacB) and DisA [[cite:PUB00084203], [cite:PUB00079210]].
