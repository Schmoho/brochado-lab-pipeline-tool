{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The ulaABCDEF operon encodes an L-ascorbate phosphotransferase transport system (UlaABC, formerly designated SgaTBA)responsible for the uptake and phosphorylation of L-ascorbate. The ulaDEF genes encode three enzymes that catalyze the anaerobic conversion of the phosphorylated, hydrolytic product of L-ascorbate, 3-keto-L-gulonate-6-phosphate, to D-xylulose-5-phosphate, which is subsequently metabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway. UlaD catalyzes a Î²-keto acid decarboxylation reaction to produce L-xylulose-5-phosphate, which undergoes successive epimerization reactions with UlaE (L-xylulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase) and UlaF (L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase), yielding D-xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>This entry represents the UlaF proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036409", "name" "Class II aldolase/adducin N-terminal domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01952" "L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase UlaF [ulaF]"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase UlaF", "short" "UlaF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 31, "taxa" 558, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 849, "sets" 0, "proteins" 849, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 662}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
