{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>BtrN catalyses an unusual radical mediated dehydrogenation during aminoglycoside biosynthesis: oxidation of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (DOIA) to amino-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose (amino-DOI) in the biosynthetic pathway of butirosin [[cite:PUB00083449], [cite:PUB00083450]]. Butirosin is an amino cyclitol glycoside antibiotic produced by<i>Bacillus circulans</i>, and bears a unique (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side chain.  BtrN contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters, the first is the canonical radical SAM cluster, the second is implicated in substrate-radical oxidation (oxidises a secondary alcohol to a ketone). This family of proteins has a non-canonical structural architecture with a β5/α4 motif [[cite:PUB00083451], [cite:PUB00083452]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4m7t", "name" "Crystal structure of BtrN in complex with AdoMet and 2-DOIA"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"sfld" {"SFLDF00424" "2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase (BtrN-like)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase (BtrN-like)", "short" "BtrN-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2, "taxa" 22, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
