{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a member of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). The BGC (BGC0000551) is described by MIBiG as an example of the following biosynthetic class, RiPP (ribosomally synthesised and post- translationally modified peptide). This family includes RamS, the precursor of lanthionine-containing peptide SapB (also known as ProSapB). SapB, which does not appear to exhibit antibiotic activity, is formed from RamS through proteolytic cleavage and subsequent creation of lanthionine bridges [[cite:PUB00099058]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF033212" "SapB/AmfS family lanthipeptide"}, "pfam" {"PF19402" "Lanthionine-containing peptide SapB precursor RamS"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Lanthionine-containing peptide SapB precursor RamS", "short" "RamS"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 368, "taxa" 1202, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1155, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1155, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 829}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR045825", :literature {"PUB00099058" {"URL" nil, "issue" "31", "authors" ["Kodani S" "Hudson ME" "Durrant MC" "Buttner MJ" "Nodwell JR" "Willey JM."], "ISO_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "title" "The SapB morphogen is a lantibiotic-like peptide derived from the product of the developmental gene ramS in Streptomyces coelicolor.", "year" 2004, "raw_pages" "11448-53", "volume" "101", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15277670}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR045825", "name" "Lanthionine-containing peptide SapB precursor RamS", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 59, "alignment:full" 427}}}
