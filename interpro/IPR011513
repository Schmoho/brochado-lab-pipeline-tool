{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nse1 ([swissprot:Q07913]) forms part of a complex with SMC5-SMC6. This non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex plays an essential role in genomic stability, being involved in DNA repair and DNA metabolism [[cite:PUB00014740], [cite:PUB00014741]].  It is conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human. Nse1 acts in a DNA repair pathway for removal of UV-induced DNA damage that is distinct from classical nucleotide excision repair and in repair of ionizing radiation damage. It also functions in homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks and in recovery of stalled replication forks [[cite:PUB00014741], [cite:PUB00014740]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7dg2", "name" "Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF07574" "Nse1 non-SMC component of SMC5-6 complex"}, "panther" {"PTHR20973" "NON-SMC ELEMENT 1-RELATED"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes element 1", "short" "Nse1"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 11, "domain_architectures" 63, "proteomes" 2429, "taxa" 8219, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4118, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4057, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2661}, "pathways" 6}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
