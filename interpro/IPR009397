{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of several Vesiculovirus matrix proteins. The matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressed in the absence of other viral components causes many of the cytopathic effects of VSV, including an inhibition of host gene expression and the induction of cell rounding. It has been shown that M protein also induces apoptosis in the absence of other viral components. It is thought that the activation of apoptotic pathways causes the inhibition of host gene expression and cell rounding by M protein [[cite:PUB00012325]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2w2r", "name" "Structure of the vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036711", "name" "VSV matrix superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06326" "Vesiculovirus matrix protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Vesiculovirus matrix", "short" "Vesiculo_matrix"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 1, "proteomes" 70, "taxa" 247, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 252, "sets" 0, "proteins" 252, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 0}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009397", :literature {"PUB00012325" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Kopecky SA" "Lyles DS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
