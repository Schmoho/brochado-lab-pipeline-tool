{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases from plants and fungi ([ec:3.2.1.78]). They catalyse the random hydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-mannosidic linkages in mannans, galactomannans and glucomannans and are crucial for depolymerization of seed galactomannans and wood galactoglucomannans [[cite:PUB00097815], [cite:PUB00067134]]. The deconstruction of the plant cell wall has had increasing importance as a key biological process in the development of a sustainable biofuel industry [[cite:PUB00067134]].
