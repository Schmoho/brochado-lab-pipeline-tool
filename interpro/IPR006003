{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, including FGGY carbohydrate kinase domain-containing proteins from mammals and D-ribulokinase YDR109C from S. cerevisiae, which catalyse ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-ribulose at C-5 to form D-ribulose 5-phosphate [[cite:PUB00099623]]. These proteins may function in a metabolite repair mechanism by preventing toxic accumulation of free D-ribulose formed by non-specific phosphatase activities, and may also play a role in regulating D-ribulose 5-phosphate recycling in the pentose phosphate pathway.</p>\n\n<p>This subfamily is closely related to a set of ribulose kinases, and many members are designated ribitol kinase. However, the member from Klebsiella pneumoniae, rbtK, from a ribitol catabolism operon, accepts D-ribulose and to a lesser extent D-arabinitol and ribitol [[cite:PUB00007926]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3l0q", "name" "The crystal structure of xlylulose kinase from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd07782" "nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of D-ribulokinase FGGY and similar proteins"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01315" "FGGY family pentulose kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "FGGY carbohydrate kinase, pentulose kinase", "short" "FGGY_RbtK-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2599, "taxa" 9605, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6891, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6891, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4713}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
