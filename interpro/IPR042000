{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Class D sortases are cysteine transpeptidases distributed in Gram-positive bacteria (mainly present in Firmicutes). They anchor surface proteins bearing a cell wall sorting signal to peptidoglycans of the bacterial cell wall envelope, which is responsible for spore formation under anaerobic conditions. This involves a transpeptidation reaction in which the surface protein substrate is cleaved at the cell wall sorting signal and covalently linked to peptidoglycan for display on the bacterial surface. The prototypical subfamily 2 of class D sortase from Clostridium perfringens (named Cp-SrtD) recognizes the LPQTGS signal motif for transpeptidation. Its catalytic activity is in a metal cation- and temperature- dependent manner. The presence of magnesium appears to enhance Cp-SrtD catalysis towards the LPQTGS signal motif [[cite:PUB00081159], [cite:PUB00092195]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4d70", "name" "Structural, biophysical and biochemical analyses of a Clostridium perfringens Sortase D5 transpeptidase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023365", "name" "Sortase domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06166" "Sortase domain found in subfamily 2 of the class D family of sortases"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Sortase D, type 2", "short" "Sortase_D_2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 359, "taxa" 1335, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1428, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1428, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1098}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR042000", :literature {"PUB00092195" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 7", "authors" ["Suryadinata R" "Seabrook SA" "Adams TE" "Nuttall SD" "Peat TS."], "ISO_journal" "Acta Crystallogr.
