{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>DNA-directed DNA polymerase ([ec:2.7.7.7]) catalyzes DNA-template-directed extension of the 3'-end of an RNA strand by one nucleotide at a time.  DNA polymerase III is a complex, multichain enzyme responsible for most of the replicative synthesis in bacteria. The enzyme also has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. It has a core composed of alpha, epsilon and theta chains, that associate with a tau subunit which allows the core dimerization to form the PolIII' complex. PolIII' associates with the gamma complex (gamma, delta, delta', psi and chi chains) and with the beta chain. This family is the psi subunit, the small subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in Escherichia coli and related species, whose exact function is not known. It appears to have a narrow taxonomic distribution, being restricted to the gammaproteobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3sxu", "name" "Structure of the E. coli SSB-DNA polymerase III interface"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036654", "name" "DNA polymerase III, psi subunit superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00664" "DNA polymerase III subunit psi"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "DNA polymerase III, psi subunit, subgroup", "short" "DNA_pol_III_psi_subgr"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 8, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 43, "taxa" 688, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 869, "sets" 0, "proteins" 869, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 662}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0263", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0263"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
