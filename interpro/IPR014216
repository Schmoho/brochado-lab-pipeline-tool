{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The gene pair cydCD encodes an ABC-family transporter in which each gene contains an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain and a C-terminal ATP-binding domain [[cite:PUB00060946]]. In Escherichia coli these genes were discovered as mutants which caused the terminal haem-copper oxidase complex cytochrome bd to fail to assemble. Recent work has shown that the transporter is involved in the export of redox-active thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione [[cite:PUB00034412], [cite:PUB00034413]]. The linkage to assembly of the cytochrome bd complex is further supported by the conserved operon structure found outside the gammaproteobacteria (cydABCD) containing both the transporter and oxidase genes components.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036640", "name" "ABC transporter type 1, transmembrane domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02857" "thiol reductant ABC exporter subunit CydD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ABC transporter, CydDC cysteine exporter (CydDC-E) family, permease/ATP-binding protein CydD", "short" "ABC_transptr_CydD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 21, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2955, "taxa" 11349, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 11308, "sets" 0, "proteins" 11308, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 8644}, "pathways" 2}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0617", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0617"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
