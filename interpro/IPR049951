{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the membrane anchor subunit (SdhE) of 8-methylmenaquinol:fumarate reductase (MFR), that catalyses the reduction of fumarate using 8-methylmenaquinol-6 as electron donor. The MFR complex is composed of three subunits: a flavoprotein (SdhA), an iron-sulfur protein (SdhB), and one hydrophobic anchor protein (represented by this entry) [[cite:PUB00153521]]. The MFR complex has no succinate oxidation activity and is involved in anaerobic metabolism. SdhE contains a striking cysteine-rich region referred to as 10-cysteine motif. This protein is predicted to contain no transmembrane domains and its association with the membrane is most likely mediated via amphipathic helices [[cite:PUB00153521]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"NF042965" "8-methylmenaquinol:fumarate reductase membrane anchor subunit"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "8-methylmenaquinol:fumarate reductase membrane anchor subunit", "short" "SdhE"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 10, "taxa" 78, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 74, "sets" 0, "proteins" 74, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 61}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
