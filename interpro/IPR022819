{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family represents a group of Poxvirus Bcl-2-like proteins that function as immunomodulators to evade the host innate immune response through the inhibition of apoptosis or blocking the activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) [[cite:PUB00097498]]. These proteins have low sequence identity but high structural similarity to the eukaryotic Bcl-2 protein family. They have a Bcl-2 fold which comprises a central hydrophobic α-helix that is surrounded by an additional layer of 6-7 amphipathic α-helices [[cite:PUB00097498]]. Included in this family are proteins B14 [[cite:PUB00097499]], A52 [[cite:PUB00097498], [cite:PUB00097500]], A46 [[cite:PUB00097500]], C6 [[cite:PUB00097497]], K7, N1, and N2 [[cite:PUB00097501]]. Protein N1 has the unusual dual ability of modulating apoptosis and inflammatory signalling [[cite:PUB00062445]]. Protein K7, in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, forms a complex with RNA helicase DDX3 and antagonises interferon-beta promoter induction [[cite:PUB00061428]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3jrv", "name" "Structure of poxvirus K7 protein in complex with RNA helicase DDX3"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR043018", "name" "Poxvirus domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF06227" "Poxvirus Bcl-2-like proteins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Poxvirus Bcl-2-like", "short" "Poxvirus_Bcl-2-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 12, "domain_architectures" 4, "proteomes" 19, "taxa" 119, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 931, "sets" 0, "proteins" 931, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR022819", :literature {"PUB00097499" {"URL" nil, "issue" "26", "authors" ["Tang Q" "Chakraborty S" "Xu G."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "Mechanism of vaccinia viral protein B14-mediated inhibition of IκB kinase β activation.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "10344-10352", "volume" "293", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29748387}, "PUB00097497" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Stuart JH" "Sumner RP" "Lu Y" "Snowden JS" "Smith GL."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Vaccinia Virus Protein C6 Inhibits Type I IFN Signalling in the Nucleus and Binds to the Transactivation Domain of STAT2.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1005955", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27907166}, "PUB00097498" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Franklin E" "Khan AR."], "ISO_journal" "J Struct Biol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Struct Biol", "title" "Poxvirus antagonism of innate immunity by Bcl-2 fold proteins.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "1-10", "volume" "181", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23138003}, "PUB00062445" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Maluquer de Motes C" "Cooray S" "Ren H" "Almeida GM" "McGourty K" "Bahar MW" "Stuart DI" "Grimes JM" "Graham SC" "Smith GL."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog.", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002430", "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Inhibition of apoptosis and NF-κB activation by vaccinia protein N1 occur via distinct binding surfaces and make different contributions to virulence.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "e1002430", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22194685}, "PUB00061428" {"URL" nil, "issue" "11", "authors" ["Oda S" "Schroder M" "Khan AR."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2009.09.005", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "Structural basis for targeting of human RNA helicase DDX3 by poxvirus protein K7.", "year" 2009, "raw_pages" "1528-37", "volume" "17", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 19913487}, "PUB00097500" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Fedosyuk S" "Bezerra GA" "Radakovics K" "Smith TK" "Sammito M" "Bobik N" "Round A" "Ten Eyck LF" "Djinovic-Carugo K" "Uson I" "Skern T."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "PLoS Pathog", "title" "Vaccinia Virus Immunomodulator A46: A Lipid and Protein-Binding Scaffold for Sequestering Host TIR-Domain Proteins.", "year" 2016, "raw_pages" "e1006079", "volume" "12", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 27973613}, "PUB00097501" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 9", "authors" ["Ferguson BJ" "Benfield CTO" "Ren H" "Lee VH" "Frazer GL" "Strnadova P" "Sumner RP" "Smith GL."], "ISO_journal" "J Gen Virol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Gen Virol", "title" "Vaccinia virus protein N2 is a nuclear IRF3 inhibitor that promotes virulence.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "2070-2081", "volume" "94", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 23761407}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR022819", "name" "Poxvirus Bcl-2-like", "type" "Family", "children" [{"accession" "IPR008724", "name" "Orthopoxvirus, Protein C1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR009174", "name" "Orthopoxvirus, Protein K7", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR009353", "name" "Orthopoxvirus, Protein N1", "type" "Family", "children" []} {"accession" "IPR011212", "name" "Poxvirus, Protein B14/B22/C16", "type" "Family", "children" []}]}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {"alignment:seed" 37, "alignment:full" 123}}}
