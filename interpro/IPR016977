They form pilin-like structures that are localised to the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall [[cite:PUB00045993]]. The comG operon also consist of ComGF, a small integral membrane protein, ComGA and ComGB, which are predicted to be a nucleotide binding protein and an integral membrane protein respectively [[cite:PUB00067657]].

For competence to develop, the transcriptional regulator, ComK, must be activated. ComK is required for the expression of genes encoding proteins that function in DNA uptake.

The comS gene is induced in response to high culture cell density and nutritional stress and its product functions to release active ComK from the complex.
