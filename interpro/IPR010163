{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Most but not all members of this family are associated with CRISPR loci, a combination of DNA repeats and characteristic proteins encoded near the repeat cluster. The C-terminal region of this protein family is homologous to DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domains with predicted transcriptional regulatory activity [[cite:PUB00020781]].</p>\n\n<p>Structures of members of this family consist of two domains that intertwine to form a homodimer. The N-terminal domain (also known as CARF domain) is a unique variation on the nucleotide binding domain  and it is essential for the dimer formation.  It is composed of a mixed β-sheet flanked on both sides with α-helices [[cite:PUB00055126], [cite:PUB00106905]]. This domain contains two conserved sequence motifs [(D/N)-X-(S/T)-X3-(R/K)  and L-X(2)-G-h-R] that map to a 2-fold symmetric pocket on the dimer axis.  It has been shown that this pocket binds cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4). The C-terminal domain is structurally similar to MarR-like winged helix-turn-helix domains and is involved in DNA recognition.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2wte", "name" "The structure of the CRISPR-associated protein, Csa3, from Sulfolobus solfataricus at 1.8 angstrom resolution."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01884" "CRISPR-associated CARF protein Csa3"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "CRISPR-associated CARF protein Csa3", "short" "Csa3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 3, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 67, "taxa" 715, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 656, "sets" 0, "proteins" 656, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 576}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0319", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0319"} {"accession" "GenProp0021", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0021"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010163", :literature {"PUB00020781" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Haft DH" "Selengut J" "Mongodin EF" "Nelson KE."], "ISO_journal" "PLoS Comput.
