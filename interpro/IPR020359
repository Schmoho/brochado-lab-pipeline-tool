{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents Biofilm regulator, BssR (from the gene also known as yliH). It represses Escherichia coli biofilm formation in M9C glu and LB glu media but not in M9C and LB media. It may act as a global regulator of several genes involved in catabolite repression and stress response and regulation of the uptake and export of signalling pathways. It could also be involved the regulation of indole as well as uptake and export of AI-2 through a cAMP-dependent pathway [[cite:PUB00044175]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF10799" "Biofilm formation protein (YliH/bssR)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Biofilm regulator BssR", "short" "Biofilm_regulator_BssR"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 46, "taxa" 739, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 792, "sets" 0, "proteins" 792, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 611}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR020359", :literature {"PUB00044175" {"URL" nil, "issue" "4", "authors" ["Domka J" "Lee J" "Wood TK."], "ISO_journal" "Appl.
