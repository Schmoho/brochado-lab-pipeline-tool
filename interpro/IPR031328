{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Ephrins are a family of proteins [[cite:PUB00004495]] that are ligands of class V (EPH-related) receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. These receptors and their ligands have been implicated in regulating neuronal axon guidance and in patterning of the developing nervous system and may also serve a patterning and compartmentalisation role outside of the nervous system as well.</p>\r\n<p>Ephrins are membrane-attached proteins of 205 to 340 residues. Attachment appears to be crucial for their normal function. Type-A ephrins are linked to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linkage, while type-B ephrins are type-I membrane proteins.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "3hei", "name" "Ligand Recognition by A-Class Eph Receptors: Crystal Structures of the EphA2 Ligand-Binding Domain and the EphA2/ephrin-A1 Complex"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR008972", "name" "Cupredoxin", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR11304" "EPHRIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ephrin", "short" "Ephrin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 27, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 968, "taxa" 3796, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 8220, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8220, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5419}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR031328", :literature {"PUB00004495" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Kozlosky CJ" "Maraskovsky E" "McGrew JT" "VandenBos T" "Teepe M" "Lyman SD" "Srinivasan S" "Fletcher FA" "Gayle RB 3rd" "Cerretti DP."], "ISO_journal" "Oncogene", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Oncogene", "title" "Ligands for the receptor tyrosine kinases hek and elk: isolation of cDNAs encoding a family of proteins.", "year" 1995, "raw_pages" "299-306", "volume" "10", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 7838529}}, :go-terms nil, :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR031328", "name" "Ephrin", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
