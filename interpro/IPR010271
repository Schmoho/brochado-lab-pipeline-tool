{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family consists of toxin-coregulated pilus subunit (TcpA) proteins from Vibrio cholerae and related sequences. The major virulence factors of toxigenic V. cholerae are cholera toxin (CT), which is encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage (CTXPhi), and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), an essential colonisation factor which is also the receptor for CTXPhi. The genes for the biosynthesis of TCP are part of a larger genetic element known as the TCP pathogenicity island [[cite:PUB00011927]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1oqv", "name" "Structure of TcpA, the Type IV pilin subunit from the toxin co-regulated pilus of Vibrio cholerae classical biotype"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR045584", "name" "Pilin-like", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF05946" "Toxin-coregulated pilus subunit TcpA"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Toxin-coregulated pilus subunit TcpA", "short" "TcpA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 2, "proteomes" 11, "taxa" 147, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 225, "sets" 0, "proteins" 225, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 195}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010271", :literature {"PUB00011927" {"URL" nil, "issue" "2", "authors" ["Faruque SM" "Kamruzzaman M" "Meraj IM" "Chowdhury N" "Nair GB" "Sack RB" "Colwell RR" "Sack DA."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
