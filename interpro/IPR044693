{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The Shugoshin (SGO) protein family plays a major role in the protection of centromeric cohesion in Drosophila and yeast. This entry represents plant shugoshins, including SGO1 and SGO2 from Arabidopsis [[cite:PUB00096854], [cite:PUB00089451]]. SGO1 is required for the maintenance of centromeric cohesion of sister chromatids in meiosis I, but not through the control of AtSYN1/AtREC8 localisation. Together with SGO2, it is required for protection of centromeric cohesion during anaphase I [[cite:PUB00089446]]. However, SGO2 is dispensable for meiosis. In rice, OsSGO1 is also involved in the assembly and maintenance of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during early prophase I [[cite:PUB00096855]]. In maize, ZmSGO1 is required for maintenance of centromeric cohesion before prophase II and correct segregation of chromatids during meiosis II [[cite:PUB00096866]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR34373" "SHUGOSHIN 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Shugoshin, plant", "short" "SGO_plant"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 227, "taxa" 884, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1342, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1342, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 837}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044693", :literature {"PUB00089446" {"URL" nil, "issue" "21", "authors" ["Cromer L" "Jolivet S" "Horlow C" "Chelysheva L" "Heyman J" "De Jaeger G" "Koncz C" "De Veylder L" "Mercier R."], "ISO_journal" "Curr.
