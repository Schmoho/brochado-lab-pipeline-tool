{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The enzymes in this family are all located in the operons for the biosynthesis of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), which is a precursor of several antibiotics including ansatrienin [[cite:PUB00009593]], naphthomycin [[cite:PUB00009593]], rifamycin [[cite:PUB00009722]] and mitomycin [[cite:PUB00009723]]. The role that this enzyme plays in this biosynthesis has not been elucidated. It is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. This enzyme is closely related to phosphoglycolate phosphatase, but it is unclear what purpose a PGPase or PGPase-like activity would serve in these biosyntheses. The family is restricted to the Gram-positive actinobacteria.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR023214", "name" "HAD superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR036412", "name" "HAD-like superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01454" "AHBA synthesis associated protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthesis-related", "short" "AHBA_synth-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 81, "taxa" 289, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 301, "sets" 0, "proteins" 301, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 251}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR006351", :literature {"PUB00009593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chen S" "von Bamberg D" "Hale V" "Breuer M" "Hardt B" "Muller R" "Floss HG" "Reynolds KA" "Leistner E."], "ISO_journal" "Eur.
