{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) constitute a family of xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes [[cite:PUB00000158]]. Using an NADPH cofactor and FAD prosthetic group, these microsomal proteins catalyse the oxygenation of nucleophilic nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus and selenium atoms in a range of structurally diverse compounds. FMOs have been implicated in the metabolism of a number of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and toxicants. In man, lack of hepatic FMO-catalysed trimethylamine metabolism results in trimethylaminuria (fish odour syndrome). Five mammalian forms of FMO are now known and have been designated FMO1-FMO5 [[cite:PUB00002642], [cite:PUB00002611], [cite:PUB00004772], [cite:PUB00000516], [cite:PUB00002834], [cite:PUB00101886]]. This is a recent nomenclature based on comparison of amino acid sequences, and has been introduced in an attempt to eliminate confusion inherent in multiple, laboratory-specific designations and tissue-based classifications [[cite:PUB00000158]]. Following the determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) [[cite:PUB00005185]], a novel gene was found to encode a protein with similarity to mammalian monooxygenases. In Aspergillus, flavin-containing monooxygenases ustF1 and ustF2 are components in the biosynthesis of the antimitotic tetrapeptide ustiloxin B, a secondary metabolite. The monooxygenases modify the side chain of the intermediate S-deoxyustiloxin H [[cite:PUB00082329]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5nmx", "name" "Crystal Structure of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid N-oxygenase from Zonocerus variegatus in complex with FAD and NADP+"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036188", "name" "FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF00743" "Flavin-binding monooxygenase-like"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Flavin monooxygenase-like", "short" "Flavin_mOase-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 64, "domain_architectures" 808, "proteomes" 5520, "taxa" 20138, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 84353, "sets" 0, "proteins" 71571, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 47417}, "pathways" 263}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1464", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1464"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
