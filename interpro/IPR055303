{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes human ATM interactor (ATMIN, also known as ATM/ATR-substrate CHK2-interacting zinc finger protein (ASCIZ)) and related proteins from animals. These proteins are transcription factors that are essential for cell survival and the formation of RAD51 foci, a response to methylating DNA damage [[cite:PUB00155326]]. Members of this family are also involved in the regulation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase activity, particularly in the absence of DNA damage, potentially by stabilising ATM [[cite:PUB00155327]]. Furthermore, these proteins are known to bind to and activate the transcription of the DYNLL1 promoter, which may have further implications in cellular response mechanisms to DNA damage [[cite:PUB00147277]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR46664" "ATM INTERACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATM interactor", "short" "ATMIN"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 885, "taxa" 3552, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1455, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1455, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 957}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR055303", :literature {"PUB00147277" {"URL" nil, "issue" "5", "authors" ["Jurado S" "Conlan LA" "Baker EK" "Ng JL" "Tenis N" "Hoch NC" "Gleeson K" "Smeets M" "Izon D" "Heierhorst J."], "ISO_journal" "J Biol Chem", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "J Biol Chem", "title" "ATM substrate Chk2-interacting Zn2+ finger (ASCIZ) Is a bi-functional transcriptional activator and feedback sensor in the regulation of dynein light chain (DYNLL1) expression.", "year" 2012, "raw_pages" "3156-64", "volume" "287", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 22167198}, "PUB00155326" {"URL" nil, "issue" "13", "authors" ["McNees CJ" "Conlan LA" "Tenis N" "Heierhorst J."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600704", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "ASCIZ regulates lesion-specific Rad51 focus formation and apoptosis after methylating DNA damage.", "year" 2005, "raw_pages" "2447-57", "volume" "24", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 15933716}, "PUB00155327" {"URL" nil, "issue" "12", "authors" ["Kanu N" "Behrens A."], "ISO_journal" "EMBO J", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601733", "medline_journal" "EMBO J", "title" "ATMIN defines an NBS1-independent pathway of ATM signalling.", "year" 2007, "raw_pages" "2933-41", "volume" "26", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 17525732}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0000976", "name" "transcription cis-regulatory region binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0045944", "name" "positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II", "category" {"code" "P", "name" "biological_process"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR055303", "name" "ATM interactor", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
