{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents a group of plant proteins, including PTAC10 from Arabidopsis. PTAC10 is a component of the PEP (plastid-encoded RNA polymerase) complex, which transcribes photosynthesis-related genes and plastid tRNAs during later developmental stages [[cite:PUB00097635], [cite:PUB00097634]]. PTAC10 contains a single S1 RNA-binding domain. PTAC10 knock-out lines have been shown to display an albino phenotype and impaired chloroplast development. PTAC10 is essential for plastid gene expression in Arabidopsis and can be phosphorylated by cpCK2. Phosphorylation of pTAC10 could enhance its RNA-binding activity [[cite:PUB00097634]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR36371" "PROTEIN PLASTID TRANSCRIPTIONALLY ACTIVE 10"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein PLASTID TRANSCRIPTIONALLY ACTIVE 10", "short" "PTAC10"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 9, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 256, "taxa" 978, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 535, "sets" 0, "proteins" 535, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 308}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR044967", :literature {"PUB00097634" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Yu QB" "Zhao TT" "Ye LS" "Cheng L" "Wu YQ" "Huang C" "Yang ZN."], "ISO_journal" "Photosynth Res", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Photosynth Res", "title" "pTAC10, an S1-domain-containing component of the transcriptionally active chromosome complex, is essential for plastid gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana and is phosphorylated by chloroplast-targeted casein kinase II.", "year" 2018, "raw_pages" "69-83", "volume" "137", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29330702}, "PUB00097635" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Chang SH" "Lee S" "Um TY" "Kim JK" "Do Choi Y" "Jang G."], "ISO_journal" "Plant Physiol", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Plant Physiol", "title" "pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "435-449", "volume" "174", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 28336770}}, :go-terms [{"identifier" "GO:0003723", "name" "RNA binding", "category" {"code" "F", "name" "molecular_function"}} {"identifier" "GO:0000427", "name" "plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase complex", "category" {"code" "C", "name" "cellular_component"}}], :entry-id nil, :hierarchy {"accession" "IPR044967", "name" "Protein PLASTID TRANSCRIPTIONALLY ACTIVE 10", "type" "Family", "children" []}, :is-llm false, :entry-annotations {}}}
