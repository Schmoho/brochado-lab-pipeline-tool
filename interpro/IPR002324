{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Cytochromes c (cytC) can be defined as electron-transfer proteins having one or several haem c groups, bound to the protein by one or, more generally, two thioether bonds involving sulphydryl groups of cysteine residues. The fifth haem iron ligand is always provided by a histidine residue. CytC possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. <p>Ambler [[cite:PUB00000610]] recognised four classes of cytC.</p>\n\n<p>Class I includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the haem-attachment site towards the N terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C terminus. On the basis of sequence similarity, class I cytC were further subdivided into five classes, IA to IE. Class ID (cyt c8) includes such bacterial proteins as Pseudomonas spp. cyt c-551, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cyt c-552 and Rhodocyclus tenuis (Rhodospirillum tenue) cyt c-553 [[cite:PUB00000610]]. Sequence characteristics include several Pro residues around the sixth ligand Met, and a conserved Trp residue near the C terminus.</p>\n\n<p>The 3D structures of cyt C-551 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas stutzeri have been determined [[cite:PUB00004589]]. The proteins consist of 5 Î±-helices; three 'core' helices form a 'basket' around the haem group, with one haem edge exposed to the solvent.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4zid", "name" "Dimeric Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c552 obtained from Escherichia coli"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036909", "name" "Cytochrome c-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00606" "CYTCHROMECID"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cytochrome c, class ID", "short" "Cyt_c_ID"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 29, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1137, "taxa" 4413, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 37469, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8714, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 6814}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR002324", :literature {"PUB00004589" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Almassy RJ" "Dickerson RE."], "ISO_journal" "Proc.
