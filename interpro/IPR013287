{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Zona occludens (ZO), or tight junctions (TJ), are specialised membrane domains found at the most apical region of polarised epithelial and endothelial cells. They create a primary barrier, preventing paracellular transport of solutes, and restricting the lateral diffusion of membrane lipids and proteins, thus maintaining cellular polarity [[cite:PUB00003085]]. They also act as diffusion barriers within plasma membranes, creating and maintaining apical and basolateral membrane domains. Under freeze-fracture electron microscopy, TJs appear as a network of continuous anastomosing intramembranous strands. These strands consist mainly of claudins and occludin ([interpro:IPR005417]), which are transmembrane proteins that polymerise within plasma membranes to form fibrils [[cite:PUB00009408]].</p>\n\n<p>Recently, the molecular architecture of tight junctions has begun to be elucidated. One group of proteins thought to be major components of TJs is the claudin family [[cite:PUB00005988]]. Immunofluorescence studies have shown that claudins are targeted to and incorporated into tight junctions [[cite:PUB00003085]]. Furthermore, when claudins are introduced into cells that lack tight junctions, networks of strands and grooves form at cell-cell contact sites that closely resemble native TJs [[cite:PUB00003087]].</p>\n\n<p>The claudin protein family is encoded by at least 17 human genes, with many homologues cloned from other species. Tissue distribution patterns for the claudin family members are distinct. Claudin-1 and -2, for example, are expressed at high levels in the liver and kidney, whereas claudin-3 mRNA is detected mainly in the lung and liver [[cite:PUB00003085], [cite:PUB00004927]]. This suggests that multiple claudin family members may be involved in tight junction strand formation in a tissue-dependent manner.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>Orthologues of the claudin 12 subtype have been identifed in humans and zebrafish.
