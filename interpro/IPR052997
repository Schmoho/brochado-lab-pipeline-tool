{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes Regulator of rDNA transcription protein 15 (RRT15) from yeast, which is involved in the modulation of rDNA transcription [[cite:PUB00075791]]. Members of this family are characterised by their role in the regulation of ribosomal DNA transcription, which is a critical process for ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. Another yeast protein, the putative uncharacterised protein ART2 in included here, which has been reported as a product of a dubious gene prediction unlikely to encode a functional protein and it is not part of the S. cerevisiae S288c complete/reference proteome set [[cite:PUB00155062]].
