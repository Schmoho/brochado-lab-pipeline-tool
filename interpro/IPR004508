{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This enzyme, involved in the assimilation of inorganic sulphate, is closely related to the thioredoxin-dependent PAPS reductase of Bacteria (CysH) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, it has its own C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and is not thioredoxin-dependent. Also, it has a substrate preference for 5'-adenylylsulphate (APS) over 3'-phosphoadenylylsulphate (PAPS) so the pathway does not require an APS kinase (CysC) to convert APS to PAPS. Arabidopsis thaliana appears to have three isozymes, all able to complement Escherichia coli CysH mutants (even in backgrounds lacking thioredoxin or APS kinase) but likely localized to different compartments in Arabidopsis.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00424" "5'-adenylylsulfate reductase, thioredoxin-independent"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Thioredoxin-independent 5'-adenylylsulphate reductase", "short" "Thioredoxin-indep_APS_Rdtase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 259, "taxa" 1034, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 858, "sets" 0, "proteins" 858, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 528}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1392", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1392"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
