{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Mycofactocin maturase MftC is a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme responsible for the first step of the biosynthesis of the enzyme cofactor mycofactocin (MFT). It catalyzes two reactions at the C terminus of the mycofactocin precursor (the MftA peptide): the first one is the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal L-tyrosine of MftA, forming an unsaturated tyramine moiety [[cite:PUB00096691], [cite:PUB00096695]]; the second reaction is the cross-linking of the tyramine with the penultimate L-valine residue, forming a five-membered lactam ring [[cite:PUB00096695]]. Its activity requires the presence of the MftB chaperone and it is also required for alcohol metabolism in Mycobacteria [[cite:PUB00096691], [cite:PUB00096692]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR013785", "name" "Aldolase-type TIM barrel", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03962" "mycofactocin radical SAM maturase"}, "sfld" {"SFLDF00316" "C-terminal tyrosine decarboxylase (MftC-like)"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Mycofactocin maturase MftC", "short" "MftC"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 441, "taxa" 1652, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 1544, "sets" 0, "proteins" 1544, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1236}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0917", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0917"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
