PKA is a tetrameric enzyme composed of a two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. Binding of 2 cAMP molecules to each R subunit leads to holoenzyme dissociation into the R dimer and two active subunits [[cite:PUB00088897], [cite:PUB00088894], [cite:PUB00088794]]. There are 4 different R sububits divided in two types, type I (RI-alpha and RI-beta), and type II (RII-alpha and RII-beta), and two main C subunits (C-alpha and C-beta) [[cite:PUB00088798]]. Type I PKA is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas type II PKA usually associates with specific cellular structures and organelles. The intracellular organization of PKA is controlled through the association with AKAPs (A-kinase-anchoring proteins) [[cite:PUB00088898], [cite:PUB00088800], [cite:PUB00088802]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PKA plays a role in the regulation of diverse processes such as growth, development, memory, metabolism, gene expression, immunity, and lipolysis. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway regulates glucose homeostasis at multiple levels including insulin and glucagon secretion, glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis and breakdown, gluconeogenesis [[cite:PUB00088796]]. The cAMP/PKA pathway acts downstream of GPCRs and regulates the activities of key molecules involved in insulin secretion, including GLUT2, KATP, and Cav [[cite:PUB00088796]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4wb8", "name" "Crystal structure of human cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (catalytic alpha subunit), exon 1 deletion"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR011009", "name" "Protein kinase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd14209" "Catalytic subunit of the Serine/Threonine Kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit", "short" "STKc_PKA"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 350, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 662, "taxa" 3087, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4329, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4329, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2427}, "pathways" 158}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
