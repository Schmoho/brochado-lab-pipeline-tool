{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family is found in Araneaea (spiders) and family members are venomus peptides with 4 disulfide bonds. Cystine knot toxins (CKTs) are small, compact molecules cross-linked by three to five disulfide bonds and are often the key contributors to the activity and potency of the venom [[cite:PUB00085320]]. While these disulfide-rich peptides can adopt a number of different structural motifs, three of the most observed structural scaffold motifs are the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) and the disulfide-directed Î²-hairpin (DDH) and Kunitz motif. These venomus peptides mainly act on membrane proteins in electro-excitable cell membranes by modulating voltage-activated sodium (NaV), calcium (CaV), and potassium (KV) channels, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) [[cite:PUB00085296]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF17486" "Cystine knot toxins"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Cystine knot toxin", "short" "Cys_Knot_tox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 3, "proteomes" 0, "taxa" 39, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 102, "sets" 0, "proteins" 102, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 97}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR035311", :literature {"PUB00085320" {"URL" nil, "issue" "15", "authors" ["Chen J" "Deng M" "He Q" "Meng E" "Jiang L" "Liao Z" "Rong M" "Liang S."], "ISO_journal" "Cell.
