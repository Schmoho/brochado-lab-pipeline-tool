{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The general (type II) secretion pathway (Gsp) within Gram-negative bacteria is a signal sequence-dependent process responsible for protein export [[cite:PUB00005409], [cite:PUB00005523], [cite:PUB00002179]]. The process has two stages: exoproteins are first translocated across the inner membrane by the general signal-dependent export pathway (GEP), and then across the outer membrane by a species-specific accessory mechanism.</p>\r\n<p>A number of proteins are involved in the Gsp; one of these is known as protein D (GspD protein), the most probable location of which is the outer membrane [[cite:PUB00002516]]. This suggests that protein D constitutes the apparatus of the accessory mechanism, and is thus involved in transporting exoproteins from the periplasm, across the outer membrane, to the extracellular environment.</p>\r\n<p>This entry represents GspD and close homologues, including the type IV pilus outer membrane secretin PilQ. It also includes virion export protein, which is thought to form a channel across the host outer membrane for the purposes of extruding the bacteriophage.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"prints" {"PR00811" "BCTERIALGSPD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "GspD/PilQ family", "short" "GspD/PilQ"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 19, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3935, "taxa" 17547, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 197208, "sets" 0, "proteins" 48768, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 36599}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001775", :literature {"PUB00005409" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Salmond GP" "Reeves PJ."], "ISO_journal" "Trends Biochem.
