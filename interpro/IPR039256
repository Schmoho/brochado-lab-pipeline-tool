{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many biological reactions proceed by enzymatic cleavage of a C-H bond adjacent to carbonyl or a carboxyl group, leading to an enol or a enolate intermediate that is subsequently re-protonated at the same or an adjacent carbon. Ketosteroid isomerases ([ec:5.3.3.1]) are important members of this class of enzymes which are the most proficient of all enzymes known and have served as a paradigm for enzymatic enolizations since their discovery in 1954. This entry includes members of this class that calalyze the isomerization of various beta,gamma-unsaturated isomers at nearly a diffusion-controlled rate. These enzymes are widely distributed in bacteria [[cite:PUB00011187], [cite:PUB00042551], [cite:PUB00024245]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "6f54", "name" "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF KETOSTEROID ISOMERASE TRIPLE VARIANT V88I/L99VD103S"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR032710", "name" "NTF2-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd00781" "ketosteroid_isomerase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Ketosteroid isomerase", "short" "Ketosteroid_isomerase"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 91, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 25, "taxa" 153, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 105, "sets" 0, "proteins" 105, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 92}, "pathways" 9}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
