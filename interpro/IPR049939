All known Mo-nitrogenases consist of two components, component I (also called dinitrogenase, or Fe-Mo protein), an alpha2beta2 tetramer encoded by the nifD and nifK genes, and component II (dinitrogenase reductase, or Fe protein) a homodimer encoded by the nifH gene [[cite:PUB00033167], [cite:PUB00033168]] which has an Fe4S4 cluster bound between the subunits and two ATP-binding domains. The Fe protein supplies energy by ATP hydrolysis, and transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin or flavodoxin to component 1 for the reduction of molecular nitrogen to ammonia [[cite:PUB00080687], [cite:PUB00080688]]. Nitrogenase contains two unusual rare metal clusters; one of them is the iron molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), which is considered to be the site of dinitrogen reduction and whose biosynthesis requires the products of the nifNE operon and of some other nif genes [[cite:PUB00033169]]. It has been proposed that nifNE might serve as a scaffold upon which FeMo-co is built and then inserted into component I [[cite:PUB00033170]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR42956" "NITROGENASE IRON-MOLYBDENUM COFACTOR BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN NIFE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Nitrogenase MoFe cofactor biosynthesis protein NifE-like", "short" "NifE-like"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1047, "taxa" 5045, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6252, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6252, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5181}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049939", :literature {"PUB00092995" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6013", "authors" ["Kaiser JT" "Hu Y" "Wiig JA" "Rees DC" "Ribbe MW."], "ISO_journal" "Science", "DOI_URL" nil, "medline_journal" "Science", "title" "Structure of precursor-bound NifEN: a nitrogenase FeMo cofactor maturase/insertase.", "year" 2011, "raw_pages" "91-4", "volume" "331", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 21212358}, "PUB00033167" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Fani R" "Gallo R" "Lio P."], "ISO_journal" "J.
