{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry includes human endonuclease III-like protein 1 (NTH1) and its homologues from animals, yeasts and plants. NTH1 is a bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase with associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase function that catalyses the first step in base excision repair (BER), the primary pathway for the repair of oxidative DNA damage [[cite:PUB00074110]]. In budding yeasts it is also known as Ntg1, which has an a paralogue, Ntg2 [[cite:PUB00074112]].
