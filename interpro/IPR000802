{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Arsenic is a toxic metalloid whose trivalent and pentavalent ions inhibit a variety of biochemical processes. Operons that encode arsenic resistance have been found in multicopy plasmids from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [[cite:PUB00002267]]. The resistance mechanism is encoded from a single operon, which houses an anion pump. The pump has two polypeptide components: a catalytic subunit (the ArsA protein), which functions as an oxyanion-stimulated ATPase; and an arsenite export component (the ArsB protein), which is associated with the inner membrane [[cite:PUB00002587]]. The ArsA and ArsB proteins are thought to form a membrane complex that functions as an anion-translocating ATPase.</p>\n\n<p>The ArsB protein is distinguished by its overall hydrophobic character, in keeping with its role as a membrane-associated channel. Sequence analysis reveals the presence of 13 putative transmembrane (TM) regions.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd01118" "ArsB_permease"}, "prints" {"PR00758" "ARSENICPUMP"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00935" "arsenite/antimonite efflux transporter"}, "pfam" {"PF02040" "Arsenical pump membrane protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Arsenical pump membrane protein, ArsB", "short" "Arsenical_pump_ArsB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 23, "proteomes" 3725, "taxa" 17001, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 62844, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22440, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17295}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0474", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0474"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000802", :literature {"PUB00002267" {"URL" nil, "issue" "8", "authors" ["Diorio C" "Cai J" "Marmor J" "Shinder R" "DuBow MS."], "ISO_journal" "J.
