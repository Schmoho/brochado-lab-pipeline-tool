{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Proteins in this group are responsible for the molecular basis of the blood group antigens, surface markers on the outside of the red blood cell membrane. Most of these markers are proteins, but some are carbohydrates attached to lipids or proteins [Reid M.E., Lomas-Francis C. The Blood Group Antigen FactsBook Academic Press, London / San Diego, (1997)]. Glycophorin A (PAS-2) and glycophorin B (PAS-3) belong to the MNS blood group system and are associated with antigens that include M/N, S/s, U, He, Mi(a), M(c), Vw, Mur, M(g), Vr, M(e), Mt(a), St(a), Ri(a), Cl(a), Ny(a), Hut, Hil, M(v), Far, Mit, Dantu, Hop, Nob, En(a), ENKT, amongst others.</p>\n\n<p>Glycophorin A is the major sialoglycoprotein of the erythrocyte membrane [[cite:PUB00000593]]. Structurally, glycophorin A consists of an N-terminal extracellular domain, heavily glycosylated on serine and threonine residues, followed by a transmembrane region and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Other glycophorins in this entry such as Glycophorin B and Glycophorin E represent minor sialoglycoproteins in the erythrocyte membrane.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5eh6", "name" "Crystal Structure of the Glycophorin A Transmembrane Monomer in Lipidic Cubic Phase"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR13813" "GLYCOPHORIN"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF002466" "Glycophorin"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Glycophorin", "short" "Glycophorin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 16, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 74, "taxa" 296, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 341, "sets" 0, "proteins" 341, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 266}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"prositedoc" {"displayName" "PROSITE Doc", "description" "PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains.", "rank" 18, "accessions" [{"accession" "PDOC00281", "url" "http://prosite.expasy.org/PDOC00281"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR001195", :literature {"PUB00000593" {"URL" nil, "issue" "3", "authors" ["Murayama J" "Utsumi H" "Hamada A."], "ISO_journal" "Biochim.
