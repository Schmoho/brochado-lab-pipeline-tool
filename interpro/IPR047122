{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This family includes a group of trans-enoyl reductases predominantly found in fungi which are part of gene clusters that mediate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including PoxP involved in the synthesis of the cytotoxic compound oxaleimide [[cite:PUB00099541]], TenC which mediates tenellin-type 2-pyridones synthesis, iron-chelating compounds involved in iron stress tolerance, competition with the natural competitor fungus Metarhizium robertsii and insect hosts infection [[cite:PUB00101980]]. Lovastatin nonaketide synthase, enoyl reductase component lovC is also part of this family, which mediates the biosynthesis of lovastatin, a hypolipidemic inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase [[cite:PUB00101981]].
