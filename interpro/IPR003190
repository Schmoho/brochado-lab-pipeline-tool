{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Decarboxylation of aspartate is the major route of beta-alanine production in bacteria, and is catalysed by the enzyme L-aspartate decarboxylase (ADC, [ec:4.1.1.11]). Beta-alanine is required for the biosynthesis of pantothenate, in which the enzyme plays a critical regulatory role. The enzyme is translated as an inactive proenzyme [[cite:PUB00070769]], and is cleaved via self-processing at Gly23-Ser24 to yield an alpha chain (C-terminal fragment) and beta chain (N-terminal fragment). This model spans the precursor (or both beta and alpha chains) of aspartate decarboxylase.  A pyruvoyl cofactor, which is covalently bound to the enzyme, is required for activity.  The active site of the tetrameric enzyme is located at the interface of two subunits, with a lysine and a histidine from the beta chain of one subunit forming the active site with residues from the alpha chain of the adjacent subunit [[cite:PUB00039881], [cite:PUB00031775], [cite:PUB00022472], [cite:PUB00019168], [cite:PUB00011777], [cite:PUB00079743]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "1pqh", "name" "Serine 25 to Threonine mutation of aspartate decarboxylase"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR009010", "name" "Aspartate decarboxylase-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd06919" "Aspartate alpha-decarboxylase or L-aspartate 1-decarboxylase, a pyruvoyl group-dependent decarboxylase in beta-alanine production"}, "hamap" {"MF_00446" "Aspartate 1-decarboxylase [panD]"}, "pfam" {"PF02261" "Aspartate decarboxylase"}, "pirsf" {"PIRSF006246" "Aspartate 1-decarboxylase"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR00223" "aspartate 1-decarboxylase"}, "panther" {"PTHR21012" "ASPARTATE 1-DECARBOXYLASE"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Aspartate decarboxylase", "short" "Asp_decarbox"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 31, "domain_architectures" 20, "proteomes" 5208, "taxa" 21028, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 22089, "sets" 0, "proteins" 22084, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 17279}, "pathways" 1}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0124", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0124"} {"accession" "GenProp1601", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1601"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
