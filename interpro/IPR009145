{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor (U2AF) is a heterodimeric splicing factor composed of a large and a small subunit [[cite:PUB00074790]]. The large U2AF subunit recognises the intronic polypyrimidine tract, a sequence located adjacent to the 3' splice site that serves as an important signal for both constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA splicing. The small subunit interacts with the 3' splice site dinucleotide AG and is essential for regulated splicing. The subunits shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm via a mechanism that involves carrier receptors and is independent of binding to mRNA. Both subunits contain an arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, which acts as a nuclear localisation signal.\nFurthermore, the presence of an RS domain on either subunit is sufficient to trigger the nucleocytoplasmic import of the heterodimeric complex [[cite:PUB00078001], [cite:PUB00078002], [cite:PUB00078003]].</p>\n\n<p>The human form of the U2 auxiliary factor small subunit, hU2AF35, contains a degenerate RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal RS domain. Mutations in this protein alters U2AF1 function affects the alternative splicing of target genes associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [[cite:PUB00099586]]. The murine form has been shown to be genomically imprinted with monoallelic expression from the paternal allele. However, this is not the case in humans [[cite:PUB00013898]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4yh8", "name" "Structure of yeast U2AF complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR12620" "U2 SNRNP AUXILIARY FACTOR, SMALL SUBUNIT"}, "prints" {"PR01848" "U2AUXFACTOR"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "U2 auxiliary factor small subunit", "short" "U2AF_small"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2668, "taxa" 9058, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 9740, "sets" 0, "proteins" 8697, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 5605}, "pathways" 21}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR009145", :literature {"PUB00013898" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Pearsall RS" "Shibata H" "Brozowska A" "Yoshino K" "Okuda K" "deJong PJ" "Plass C" "Chapman VM" "Hayashizaki Y" "Held WA."], "ISO_journal" "Biochem.
