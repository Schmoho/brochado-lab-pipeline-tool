{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Glutaminases ([ec:3.5.1.2]) deaminate glutamine to glutamate. In Bacillus subtilis, glutaminase is encoded by glnA, which is part of an operon, glnA-glnT (formerly ybgJ-ybgH), where glnT encodes a glutamine transporter. The glnA-glnT operon is regulated by the 2-component system GlnK-GlnL in response to glutamine [[cite:PUB00033342]].

Many bacteria have two isozymes. This model is based on selected known glutaminases and their homologues within prokaryotes, with the exclusion of highly-derived (long branch) and architecturally varied homologues, so as to achieve conservative assignments. A sharp drop in scores occurs below 250, and cutoffs are set accordingly. The enzyme converts glutamine to glutamate, with the release of ammonia. Members tend to be described as glutaminase A (glsA), where B (glsB) is unknown and may not be homologous (as in Rhizobium etli.
