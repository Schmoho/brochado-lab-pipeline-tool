{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry describes MinD, a multifunctional cell division protein that guides correct placement of the septum. In Escherichia coli, the cell division site is determined by the cooperative activity of min operon products MinC, MinD, and MinE [[cite:PUB00014907]]. MinD is a membrane-associated ATPase and is a septum site-determining factor through the activation and regulation of MinC and MinE. MinD is also known to undergo a rapid pole-to-pole oscillation movement in vivo as observed by fluorescent microscopy. In plants, chloroplast division requires the dimerisation of stromal MinD [[cite:PUB00014908]]. The homologous archaeal MinD proteins, with many archaeal genomes having two or more forms, are described by a separate entry.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "4v03", "name" "MinD cell division protein, Aquifex aeolicus"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR01968" "septum site-determining protein MinD"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP binding protein MinD", "short" "MinD"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3863, "taxa" 16887, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 14990, "sets" 0, "proteins" 14990, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 11676}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0165", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0165"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR010223", :literature {"PUB00014907" {"URL" nil, "issue" "9", "authors" ["Sakai N" "Yao M" "Itou H" "Watanabe N" "Yumoto F" "Tanokura M" "Tanaka I."], "ISO_journal" "Structure", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00638-4", "medline_journal" "Structure", "title" "The three-dimensional structure of septum site-determining protein MinD from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 in complex with Mg-ADP.", "year" 2001, "raw_pages" "817-26", "volume" "9", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 11566131}, "PUB00014908" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 11", "authors" ["Fujiwara MT" "Nakamura A" "Itoh R" "Shimada Y" "Yoshida S" "Moller SG."], "ISO_journal" "J.
