{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The pattern of DNA methylation at cytosine bases in the genome is tightly linked to gene expression [[cite:PUB00090654]]. TET proteins, including TET1/2/3, convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. They can also convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine [[cite:PUB00090652]]. They play roles in epigenetic regulation [[cite:PUB00056275], [cite:PUB00090653]]. Human TET2 mutations have been linked to various leukaemias. TET2 and TET3 interact with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and promotes OGT-mediated GlcNAcylation [[cite:PUB00087869]]. The double epigenetic modifications on both DNA and histones by TET2 and OGT coordinate together for the regulation of gene transcription [[cite:PUB00090653]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5deu", "name" "Crystal structure of TET2-5hmC complex"}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"panther" {"PTHR23358" "METHYLCYTOSINE DIOXYGENASE TET"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1/2/3", "short" "TET1/2/3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 870, "taxa" 3566, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3789, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3789, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 616}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
