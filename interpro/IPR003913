{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes. The disease is characterised by hamartomas in one or more organs (including brain, skin, heart and kidney) giving rise to a broad phenotypic spectrum (including seizures, mental retardation, renal dysfunction and dermatological abnormalities. TSC2 encodes tuberin, a putative GTPase activating protein for rap1 and rab5. The TSC1 gene was recently identified and codes for hamartin, a novel protein with no significant similarity to tuberin or any other known vertebrate protein [[cite:PUB00007617]]. Hamartin and tuberin have been shown to associate physically in vivo, their interaction being mediated by predicted coiled-coil domains. It is thought that hamartin and tuberin function in the same complex, rather than in separate pathways. Moreover, because oligomerisation of the hamartin C-terminal coiled coil domain is inhibited by the presence of tuberin, it is possible that tuberin acts as a chaperone, preventing hamartin self-aggregation [[cite:PUB00007617]].</p>\n\n<p>Tuberin is a widely expressed 1784-amino-acid protein. Expression of the wild-type gene in TSC2 mutant tumour cells inhibits proliferation and tumorigenicity. This \"suppressor\" activity is encoded by a functional domain in the C terminus that shares similarity with the GTPase activating protein Rap1GAP [[cite:PUB00007618]]. It is thought that tuberin functions as a Rab5GAP in vivo to negatively regulate Rab5-GTP activity in endocytosis [[cite:PUB00007619]]. It also acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase RheB, a direct activator of the protein kinase activity of mTORC1 [[cite:PUB00062932], [cite:PUB00062931]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR016024", "name" "Armadillo-type fold", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR01431" "TUBERIN"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Tuberin", "short" "Tuberin"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 878, "taxa" 3682, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 23646, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2786, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 219}, "pathways" 19}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp2033", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp2033"}]}}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR003913", :literature {"PUB00007617" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["van Slegtenhorst M" "Nellist M" "Nagelkerken B" "Cheadle J" "Snell R" "van den Ouweland A" "Reuser A" "Sampson J" "Halley D" "van der Sluijs P."], "ISO_journal" "Hum.
