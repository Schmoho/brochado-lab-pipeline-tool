{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this family are the PhnL protein of C-P lyase systems for utilization of phosphonates. These systems resemble phosphonatase-based systems in having a three-component ABC transporter, where [interpro:IPR005769] is the permease, [interpro:IPR005770] is the phosphonates binding protein, and [interpro:IPR012693] is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein. They differ, however, in having, typically, ten or more additional genes, many of which are believed to form a membrane-associated C-P lyase complex. This protein (PhnL) and the adjacent-encoded PhnK ([interpro:IPR012700]) resemble transporter ATP-binding proteins but are suggested, based on mutagenesis studies, to be part of this C-P lyase complex rather than part of a transporter per se [[cite:PUB00011420], [cite:PUB00016017]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "7z15", "name" "E. coli C-P lyase bound to a PhnK/PhnL dual ABC dimer and ADP + Pi"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR02324" "phosphonate C-P lyase system protein PhnL"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Phosphonate C-P lyase system, PhnL", "short" "CP_lyase_PhnL"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 2, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 1042, "taxa" 4662, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 4186, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4186, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 3285}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp1630", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1630"} {"accession" "GenProp1165", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1165"} {"accession" "GenProp1381", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp1381"} {"accession" "GenProp0232", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0232"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
