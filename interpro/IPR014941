{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Many Bacteroides-like bacterial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, the causal agent of periodontal infection, carry at least two types of fimbriae, namely FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae, following the names of their major subunit proteins [[cite:PUB00055567]]. Normally, FimA fimbriae are long filaments that are easily detached from cells, whereas Mfa1 fimbriae are short filaments that are tightly bound to cells.</p>\r\n<p>In many bacteria, the gene encoding the major fimbrilin typically forms a cluster with several additional genes encoding fimbrial minor components. FimB, the product of the gene immediately downstream of the fimA gene, regulates the length and expression of FimA fimbriae. Additionally, FimB functions as an anchor of the fimbriae [[cite:PUB00080708]]. Similarly, Mfa2 seems to regulate the length and attachment of Mfa1 fimbriae. Mfa2 and Mfa1 are associated with each other in whole P. gingivalis cells to the extent that Mfa2 is located on the cell surface and probably associated with Mfa1 fimbriae in such a way that it anchors the Mfa1 fimbriae to the cell surface and regulates Mfa1 filament length [[cite:PUB00055568]]. Mfa3 is a tip protein of the Mfa1 fimbriae that may function in the integration of accessory proteins and in the colonization of P. gingivalis [[cite:PUB00080709]].</p>.", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5nf4", "name" "The tip fimbrial protein Mfa3 from Porphyromonas gingivalis with C-terminal truncation."}, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF08842" "Fimbrillin-A associated anchor proteins Mfa1 and Mfa2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Fimbrium subunit FimB/Mfa2/Mfa3", "short" "FimB/Mfa2/Mfa3"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 5, "domain_architectures" 18, "proteomes" 172, "taxa" 811, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 3394, "sets" 0, "proteins" 3394, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2571}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR014941", :literature {"PUB00080709" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Hasegawa Y" "Nagano K" "Ikai R" "Izumigawa M" "Yoshida Y" "Kitai N" "Lamont RJ" "Murakami Y" "Yoshimura F."], "ISO_journal" "Mol Oral Microbiol", "DOI_URL" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/omi.12040", "medline_journal" "Mol Oral Microbiol", "title" "Localization and function of the accessory protein Mfa3 in Porphyromonas gingivalis Mfa1 fimbriae.", "year" 2013, "raw_pages" "467-80", "volume" "28", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 24118823}, "PUB00055567" {"URL" nil, "issue" "7", "authors" ["Park Y" "Simionato MR" "Sekiya K" "Murakami Y" "James D" "Chen W" "Hackett M" "Yoshimura F" "Demuth DR" "Lamont RJ."], "ISO_journal" "Infect.
