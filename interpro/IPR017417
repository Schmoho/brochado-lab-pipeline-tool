{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Protein phosphatase 1(PP-1) is a major protein serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates a vast array of cellular processes. PP-1 action is controlled through regulatory subunits that not only dictate substrate specificity and subcellular localisation, but often regulate PP-1 activity [[cite:PUB00073640]]. The myosin phosphatase targeting protein (MYPT) family consists of regulatory subunits MYPT1, MYPT2, MBS85, MYPT3 and TIMAP. MYPT family members share several conserved domains, including an RVxF motif for PP1c binding, and several ankyrin repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions [[cite:PUB00073641]].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entry consists of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunits 16A (MYPT3) and 16B (TIMAP). MYPT3 and TIMAP contain a C-terminal CaaX box (a prenylation motif where 'a' indicates an aliphatic amino acid: CLLM in MYPT3 and CRIS in TIMAP), similar to that identified in the Rho family of small GTPases, which targets the proteins to the cell membrane [[cite:PUB00073642]]. MYPT3 binding to PP1c inhibits its catalytic activity towards LC20, contrary to other MYPT family members [[cite:PUB00073643]]. TIMAP (TGF-beta-inhibited membrane-associated protein) is primarily localised to the plasma membrane of endothelial cells [[cite:PUB00073642], [cite:PUB00073645]]. TIMAP-PP1c substrates identified include the non-integrin laminin receptor 1 (LAMR1), which is involved in regulation of cell motility and angiogenesis [[cite:PUB00073644]], and ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) proteins, which crosslink actin filaments with plasma membranes [[cite:PUB00073646]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036770", "name" "Ankyrin repeat-containing domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"pirsf" {"PIRSF038159" "Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunits 16A/B, vertebrate type"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 16A/B", "short" "Pase-1_reg_su_16AB"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 482, "taxa" 1614, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 771, "sets" 0, "proteins" 702, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 527}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR017417", :literature {"PUB00073640" {"URL" nil, "issue" "Pt 2", "authors" ["Cohen PT."], "ISO_journal" "J.
