{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>This entry represents the putative sulfur carrier protein YedF from Escherichia coli and similar sequences from proteobacteria. YedF is a bacterial SirA-like protein probably related with pathogenesis [[cite:PUB00152854]].  SirA (also known as UvrY,  and YhhP) belongs to a family of a two-component response regulators that controls secondary metabolism and virulence. The other member of this two-component system is a sensor kinase called BarA which phosphorylates SirA. A variety of microorganisms have similar proteins, all of which contain a common CPxP sequence motif in the N-terminal region. YhhP is suggested to be important for normal cell division and growth in rich nutrient medium [[cite:PUB00013981], [cite:PUB00013979]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR036868", "name" "TusA-like domain superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"cdd" {"cd03422" "YedF"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "YedF", "short" "YedF"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 1, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 93, "taxa" 1002, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 866, "sets" 0, "proteins" 866, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 657}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR049570", :literature {"PUB00152854" {"URL" nil, "issue" "1", "authors" ["Balleste-Delpierre C" "Fernandez-Orth D" "Ferrer-Navarro M" "Diaz-Pena R" "Odena-Caballol A" "Oliveira E" "Fabrega A" "Vila J."], "ISO_journal" "Sci Rep", "DOI_URL" "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15369-7", "medline_journal" "Sci Rep", "title" "First insights into the pleiotropic role of vrf (yedF), a newly characterized gene of Salmonella Typhimurium.", "year" 2017, "raw_pages" "15291", "volume" "7", "ISBN" nil, "PMID" 29127378}, "PUB00013979" {"URL" nil, "issue" "24", "authors" ["Teplitski M" "Goodier RI" "Ahmer BM."], "ISO_journal" "J.
