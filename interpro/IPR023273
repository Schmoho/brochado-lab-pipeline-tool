{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>The prototypical member of the Nucleolar Protein 2 RCMT subfamily, the S.cerevisiae NOP2, is an essential nucleolar protein required for pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosomal subunit assembly [[cite:PUB00054131]] that acts as a ribosomal RNA methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00054137], [cite:PUB00072550]]. Its human homologue, the proliferation-associated nucleolar antigen P120, is a promising tumour marker [[cite:PUB00054138]]. P120 has been demonstrated to be implicated in rRNA biogenesis [[cite:PUB00054139], [cite:PUB00097261]], and is also proposed to act as an rRNA methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00054140]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>RNA (C5-cytosine) methyltransferases (RCMTs) catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to the 5th carbon of a cytosine base in RNA sequences to produce C5-methylcytosine. RCMTs use the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor [[cite:PUB00054125]]. The catalytic mechanism of RCMTs involves an attack by the thiolate of a Cys residue on position 6 of the target cytosine base to form a covalent link, thereby activating C5 for methyl-group transfer. Following the addition of the methyl group, a second Cys residue acts as a general base in the beta-elimination of the proton from the methylated cytosine ring. The free enzyme is restored and the methylated product is released [[cite:PUB00054126]].</p>\n\n<p>Numerous putative RCMTs have been identified in archaea, bacteria and eukaryota [[cite:PUB00014205], [cite:PUB00054127]]; most are predicted to be nuclear or nucleolar proteins [[cite:PUB00054128]]. The Escherichia coli Ribosomal RNA Small-subunit Methyltransferase Beta (RSMB) FMU (FirMicUtes) represents the first protein identified and characterised as a cytosine-specific RNA methyltransferase. RSMB was reported to catalyse the formation of C5-methylcytosine at position 967 of 16S rRNA [[cite:PUB00054129], [cite:PUB00014203]].</p>\n\n<p>A classification of RCMTs has been proposed on the basis of sequence similarity [[cite:PUB00014205]]. According to this classification, RCMTs are divided into 8 distinct subfamilies [[cite:PUB00014205]]. Recently, a new RCMT subfamily, termed RCMT9, was identified [[cite:PUB00054127]]. Members of the RCMT contain a core domain, responsible for the cytosine-specific RNA methyltransferase activity. This 'catalytic' domain adopts the Rossman fold for the accommodation of the cofactor SAM [[cite:PUB00054130]]. The RCMT subfamilies are also distinguished by N-terminal and C-terminal extensions, variable both in size and sequence [[cite:PUB00014205]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"prints" {"PR02012" "RNA (C5-cytosine) methyltransferase NOP2 subfamily"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "RNA (C5-cytosine) methyltransferase, NOP2", "short" "RCMT_NOP2"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 26, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2423, "taxa" 8352, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 12612, "sets" 0, "proteins" 4234, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 2717}, "pathways" 147}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
