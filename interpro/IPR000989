{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Replication proteins (rep) are involved in plasmid replication. The Rep protein binds to the plasmid DNA and nicks it at the double strand origin (dso) of replication. The 3'-hydroxyl end created is extended by the host DNA replicase, and the 5' end is displaced during synthesis. At the end of one replication round, Rep introduces a second single stranded break at the dso and ligates the ssDNA extremities generating one double-stranded plasmid and one circular ssDNA form. Complementary strand synthesis of the circular ssDNA is usually initiated at the single-stranded origin by the host RNA polymerase [[cite:PUB00003879]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure nil, :overlaps-with nil, :member-databases {"pfam" {"PF01446" "Replication protein"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Replication protein", "short" "Rep"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 0, "domain_architectures" 10, "proteomes" 227, "taxa" 2276, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 2469, "sets" 0, "proteins" 2467, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 1963}, "pathways" 0}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {}, :set-info nil, :accession "IPR000989", :literature {"PUB00003879" {"URL" nil, "issue" "6", "authors" ["Marsin S" "Forterre P."], "ISO_journal" "Mol.
