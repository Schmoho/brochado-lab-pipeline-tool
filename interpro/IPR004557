{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>These proteins exhibit homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mtq2 (also know as PrmC [[cite:PUB00090823]]). Mtq2 methylates eRF1 on 'Gln-182' using S-adenosyl L-methionine as methyl donor. eRF1 needs to be complexed to eRF3 in its GTP-bound form to be efficiently methylated [[cite:PUB00063061], [cite:PUB00063062], [cite:PUB00041889]]. In bacteria, the methylation of RF1/RF2 by PrmC is important for normal growth, to increase the affinity of RF1/RF2 for ribosomes and to enhance translation termination [[cite:PUB00093695], [cite:PUB00093696]]. Human homologue of Mtq2 is called hemK methyltransferase family member 2 (HEMK2, also known as N6AMT1), which is an N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase [[cite:PUB00090976]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "8qdg", "name" "compound 1a bound KMT9 crystal structure"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR029063", "name" "S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase superfamily", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR00537" "HemK2/MTQ2 family protein methyltransferase"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Eukaryotic/archaeal PrmC-related", "short" "PrmC-related"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 10, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 2211, "taxa" 9447, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 6513, "sets" 0, "proteins" 6513, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 4836}, "pathways" 151}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
