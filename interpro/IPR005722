Both the F1 and F0 complexes are rotary motors that are coupled back-to-back. In the F1 complex, the central gamma subunit forms the rotor inside the cylinder made of the α(3)β(3) subunits, while in the F0 complex, the ring-shaped C subunits forms the rotor. The two rotors rotate in opposite directions, but the F0 rotor is usually stronger, using the force from the proton gradient to push the F1 rotor in reverse in order to drive ATP synthesis  [[cite:PUB00009752]]. These ATPases can also work in reverse in bacteria, hydrolysing ATP to create a proton gradient.</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false} {"text" "<p>In F-ATPases, there are three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the catalytic core of the F1 complex, while the remaining F1 subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon) form part of the stalks.

The alpha and beta subunits form a cylinder that is attached to the central stalk. The alpha/beta subunits undergo a sequence of conformational changes leading to the formation of ATP from ADP, which are induced by the rotation of the gamma subunit, itself is driven by the movement of protons through the F0 complex C subunit [[cite:PUB00020611], [cite:PUB00007884]].</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "2jdi", "name" "Ground state structure of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria (Bovine F1-ATPase crystallised in the absence of azide)"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"} {"accession" "IPR024034", "name" "ATPase, F1/V1 complex, beta/alpha subunit, C-terminal", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"hamap" {"MF_01347" "ATP synthase subunit beta [atpB]"}, "ncbifam" {"TIGR01039" "F0F1 ATP synthase subunit beta"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "ATP synthase, F1 complex, beta subunit", "short" "ATP_synth_F1_bsu"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 320, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 11150, "taxa" 72339, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 69998, "sets" 0, "proteins" 69993, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 54810}, "pathways" 26}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0128", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0128"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
