{:metadata {:description [{"text" "<p>Members of this protein family are designated polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2) after the characterised protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [[cite:PUB00020170]]. This family comprises one of three well-separated clades in the larger family described by Pfam model [pfam:PF03976]. GDP-polyphosphate phosphotransferase, also known as Polyphosphate kinase PPK2 1 (gene PA0141) ([swissprot:Q9I6Z1]) from this family has been shown capable of operating in reverse, with GDP preferred (over ADP) as a substrate, producing GTP (or ATP) by transfer of a phosphate residue from polyphosphate [[cite:PUB00020170]]. Most species with a member of this family also encode a polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1).</p>", "llm" false, "checked" false, "updated" false}], :is-reviewed-llm false, :representative-structure {"accession" "5llb", "name" "Structure of Polyphosphate Kinase 2 from Francisella tularensis with AMPPCH2PPP and polyphosphate"}, :overlaps-with [{"accession" "IPR027417", "name" "P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", "type" "homologous_superfamily"}], :member-databases {"ncbifam" {"TIGR03707" "polyphosphate kinase 2"}}, :is-updated-llm false, :name {"name" "Polyphosphate kinase 2, PA0141", "short" "PPK2_PA0141"}, :wikipedia nil, :source-database "interpro", :type "family", :counters {"structures" 6, "domain_architectures" 0, "proteomes" 3477, "taxa" 12949, "subfamilies" 0, "interactions" 0, "matches" 17796, "sets" 0, "proteins" 17794, "structural_models" {"alphafold" 13615}, "pathways" 3}, :integrated nil, :cross-references {"gp" {"displayName" "Genome Properties", "description" "Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein signatures within that genome.", "rank" 45, "accessions" [{"accession" "GenProp0840", "url" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/genome-property/GenProp0840"}]}, "ec" {"displayName" "ENZYME", "description" "ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes.
